There‚Äôs crime in every major city, how about yall do y‚Äôall‚Äôs research BERFORE moving into others spaces. My city (DC) used to be called ‚ÄúChocolate City‚Äù because the population was predominantly BLACK! Over the last 10yrs there‚Äôs been sooooo much change in DC due to all these outsiders moving in. They have the audacity to move to DC and then complain about how us natives BEEN living BEFORE DC was gentrified. 

Specifically white people are some of the most entitled. Moving to a predominately BLACK city they didn‚Äôt grow up in doesn‚Äôt grant them the rights to know what‚Äôs best for that city especially when most outsiders only complain about things that makes THEM uncomfortable all while disregarding the norm of our culture and city. 

Y‚Äôall in the comments saying more police needs to be patrolling Ust or some comments saying Black ppl wanna be victimized and how the crime rate in DC is due to the Black population. Newsflash bitches anyone who has an issue with DC natives can simply move and not deal with the Black ppl Natives. Yall love interjecting yall selves into our spaces but hate us at the same time? Lmaooo! 

The funny thing is, is that yall outsiders get robbed, car jacked, assaulted‚Ä¶.etc because yall are GREEN, SWEET ASF and SELF ABSORBED, yall have the ‚Äúnothing can happen to me‚Äù mentality it‚Äôs apart of yalls sense of entitlement. Yall also skip over the fact that we natives do NOT WANT YALL HERE!!! I hope the crime rate runs yall OUT of the city and back to where tf yall came from.

No, hiring practices do not decide to not hire people because of the color of their skin.  Affirmative action and similar efforts are only foots in the door, this whole ""hire people based on the color of their skin"" is right wing hysteria that the media feeds their viewers.  Just like your comment on DEI.  DEI is about internal practices to avoid discrimination, it doesn't put minorities on a pedestal.

Liberal people, including white people, agree that crime in cities is mostly about culture.  What they don't agree is that it inherently has to do with their skin color, but rather policies that were in place (that may or may no longer be) that disenfranchised minorities and placed undue burden on them to succeed, that didn't apply to white people.  As well as, unwritten policies like bank loans, etc that historically discriminated against minorities.  These have lasting effects that can be felt for generations, we aren't too far gone from when such policies were in place.

Your experience with a ""black friend"" is a dog whistle.  

No, that list of police brutality you just listed is highly cherry picked. They also come after years of actual police brutality and targeting of minorities. The guy who called the police and was being attacked by a woman with a knife was immediately shot by police, even when they had the description of the attacker which was nothing like the guy. The lady who was following orders and was still shot in her own kitchen.  The caretaker of the mentally ill guy who was shot even though he was unarmed, and assisting the mentally ill person who was having an episode.

Criminality is tied to family - 2/3 of crime is committed by 10% of families.  The real issue is that criminal families pass down criminal habits.  We need to break that cycle (my preference is through the use of ever increasing prison sentences).  I also believe that we need to take steps to reduce poverty and the impact of poverty, but we need to take both these steps simultaneously.

You‚Äôre still right that poverty doesn‚Äôt explain all of it, but impoverished black people are much more likely to commit crimes than middle class or wealthy black people, and it can explain a lot of it. 

The poverty cycle, for all races, is at least partially a cultural issue, as those in poverty raise impoverished kids who learn how to live and make the decisions in the same way their parents do. Once one generation of the family breaks the poverty cycle their kids also tend to stay out of crime themselves, even if they are not wealthy.

And poverty culture is not black culture, black culture is rich and vibrant that far exceeds the relatively small percentage of black people that commit crimes. Poverty culture exists in white people as well, but you wouldn‚Äôt call that white culture.",-2,2024,11

You realize that a black man did a full research study into ""systemic racism"" and found that it's not really a thing, other than they have ti get rougher with people that won't comply.

(Harvard Economics Professor Roland Fryer discussed the fallout from a 2016 study he published on racial bias in Houston policing.)

""The study found that police were more than twice as likely to manhandle, beat or use some other kind of nonfatal force against blacks and Hispanics than against people of other races. However, the data also determined that officers were 23.8 percent less likely to shoot at blacks and 8.5 percent less likely to shoot at Hispanics than they were to shoot at whites.""

He then extended this research country wide and got the same results. That in cases where the offenders are rude and non-compliant, or live in high crime areas, police may be rougher, but they are more likely to go to the extreme with white people.

Now, you have racism vs jews and whites as ""payback"" for the south having slaves? People tend to forget that racism wasn't a ""country-wide"" thing, anyways. The Xivil War wasn't even ""about slavery."" It was about 80 years of federal government overreach.

You're trying so hard to try and paint Nazis and Marxist with the same brush, and it's fucking embarrassing. They are nothing alike, they are polar opposites on the political spectrum Nazis will forever be authoritarian right, and Marx, lib left. It's why the Nazis put socialists in camps.


>I lived through the Cold War era.

Which involved neither Marxism, or fascism. Fascism was entirely killed off, a dead end ideology until skin heads here at home took it back up. Neither Stalin or Lenin took directly after Marx. They both changed things for their benefit. Which is a far more authoritarian government. A leftist one to be sure, but not Marxism (which is also pretty much dead). They are not the same.

>Fascism is simply the Italian version of the German national socialism. Both are still socialism.

No, fascism is an ideology. Fascista was the Italian fascist party, and the NSDAP was the german fascist party. Neither are socialist,  because once again, they threw socialist into camps.


So just to be üíØ % clear. The fascists threw socialists into concentration camps. They wore red triangle badges to identify why they were there, waiting to be killed.

>And I know, you don‚Äôt have to say it: that wasn‚Äôt real socialism; neither was Mao or Pol Pot. Real socialism has never been tried

>Socialism doesn‚Äôt just rob the people of what they earned through their efforts, resulting in mass poverty and privation while the ruling elite lives on the wealth stolen from the working class.

>Nazis will forever be authoritarian right, and Marx, lib left. It‚Äôs why the Nazis put socialists in camps.

So, you‚Äôre claiming that Marxism, which is definitely socialism, is a liberal philosophy? I think you either don‚Äôt know what the word ‚Äòliberal‚Äô means or you have no idea what socialism is.

From the dictionary:

adjective
Favoring reform, open to new ideas, and *tolerant of the ideas and behavior of others*; not bound by traditional thinking; *broad-minded*.

Yeah, there is no form of socialism that fits the word ‚Äòliberal‚Äô, by it‚Äôs actual meaning. 

While it‚Äôs true that the word ‚Äòliberal‚Äô has been commandeered by the authoritarian statist left, that doesn‚Äôt mean the actual definition of the word has changed.

War is not peace, freedom is not slavery, ignorance is not strength, and socialism is not a liberal philosophy.

>> I lived through the Cold War era.

>Which involved neither Marxism‚Ä¶Neither Stalin or Lenin took directly after Marx. 

As predicted.

>Neither are socialist,  because once again, they threw socialist into camps‚Ä¶So just to be üíØ % clear. The fascists threw socialists into concentration camps.

So, which group wasn‚Äôt actually christian? Catholics or Protestants? They both hated and killed each other. 

People who desire power don‚Äôt like other people cutting into their power. They see such people as a threat, even if they are from the same camp, and they take measures to end that threat. It‚Äôs that simple.

>We‚Äôve got plenty of countries with strong elements of socialism, and they‚Äôre doing pretty damn well.

First of all, elements of socialism isn‚Äôt *being* socialist. It‚Äôs having socialistic elements.

Are you referring to the UK, where people don‚Äôt have any rights, only government granted privileges, and people get arrested for speech the government doesn‚Äôt like? Where nearly 60% of the population is on government assistance, paid for by the other 40%

That doesn‚Äôt sound like a system that‚Äôs doing well, to me.

Or are you referring to Scandinavian counties?

Socialism doesn‚Äôt work to preserve the rights of the people. It doesn‚Äôt encourage hard work and innovation. It incentivizes mediocrity and stagnation. It doesn‚Äôt work as an economic system. It always fails, and, while in place, it always results in a huge impoverished class and a very rich ruling class minority.

573,1h2wunn,SanityLostStudio,"It did find that it's not really a thing, as the way it is presented in current media and by most people that are left of Center.

As I stated, there are bad people, and racists, but this idea that it's systemic has been destroyed by MANY black academics. Thomas Sowell, Ben Carson, and other are all called ""Uncle Toms"" and ""House You-Knows"" anytime they present evidence to the contrary.

Today, you have literal hiring practices that discriminate. It's not just ""this hiring manager is a racist."" It's, ""no we won't hire you based off of skin color or sexual orientation, because we have to hit quotas."" That is systemic racism.

Let's look at Baltimore City, ran by Democrats for the majority of it's last 30+ years. Unfortunately, the thing is, talk to any corner boys, every honest convo is that they know the ""culture"" is the problem. The majority of people that say it's not, are white Liberals that never step foot in these neighborhoods. 

Let's look at most of the top recent examples of ""racist police"" that were MAJOR stories. Smollette faked a hate crime and got let off with charges dropped. A lady attacked a cop with a knife. Another famous dude attacked cops at a traffic stop. A guy was super high on fent. And all of these were called ""systemic racist examples of police brutality,"" until body cam footage and coroner's reports got released.

""Systemic Racism"" is racism baked into the system. That's the definition of D E I. That's the definition of reparations, to people that had nothing to do with that history, nor did their families, and paid for by even those in the North that never owned anyone and their families faught and died for the cause, yet they are still hated today, because they are grouped with ""their race.""

So again, Baltimore City 2 or 3 years ago had ZERO of 2000+ students across all public schools and grade levels pass grade level math and single digit % passed reading on state exams. Democrat policies like ""no child left behind"" pass these students and then they can't get jobs, because they aren't prepared. Then when they cant get a job, it's because of the ""racist white manager,"" or racism, in general.

Ask my buddy, he's 32, cant read much. He HATES the system, because it set him up to fail, but the system that failed him passed him, because failing him, holding him back, and teaching him was deemed ""racist"" by liberals. (WhichI used to be back in the Georve W Bush days)

The issue, again, is that with 300+ Million people, all with different upbringings, and current culture blaming each other for problems, instead of actually trying to fix things the right way, it MAKES racists, and makes things worse.

Most black people I know HATE the ""White savior"" complex of rich white kids fighting for things they never asked them too. They also don't like being told that single parent households are cool.

Racist exist, they are bad people, but the ""systemic"" issues don't exist the way people claim they do.

That doesn't mean I'm saying it NEVER existed, I'm saying that the pendulum swung the other way and all it's done is created more bad people, not made things better and that when the educated black community comes out saying these same things, they are called names and ran off by race grifters and 20 yr old white kids from the suburbs.",3,2024,11

602,1h2wunn,sailor-jackn,"So, you‚Äôre blaming other countries for the way a population runs their country for hundreds of years? The world has been in a constant state of warfare since humans rose to prominence. Numerous civilizations have sprung from tiny tribal beginnings to become amazing advanced civilizations, amid war and conflict, in a very difficult world to even survive in. 

What you are doing amounts to racism, because you are saying the people of these countries naturally just don‚Äôt have the ability to do what other countries have been able to do. In reality, they made different choices, ones that didn‚Äôt lead to successful futures for their countries. It‚Äôs not that they made all the right choices, and simply couldn‚Äôt accomplish more than  becoming third world countries.

The US started out as a smaller country; one that was just getting started. It wasn‚Äôt always a huge wealthy country. Americans built it into a huge prosperous country, over 248 years. Had America ended up as a third world country, no one would have blamed the countries around it for this happening. Similarly, if we allow our country to turn into a third world banana republic, no one is going to give us a pass, and blame other countries for this happening. They will, rightly, blame us for what we turn our country into. 

Personal responsibility is a thing.

The reason you see cities crumbling into crime and squalor is specifically because it‚Äôs not PC to hold people responsible for their actions. Instead, it‚Äôs PC to blame everyone around them for their own failures. People generally tend to meet the expectations society has for them, rather than exceeding those expectations. 

If you have no expectations, regardless of how seemingly well intentioned this lack is, you‚Äôre setting society up for failure.  Why do you think very poor Asian families come here, and, in a generation, have become prosperous? They have strong expectations of their children.",1,2024,11

1091,1ce7smd,gun_is_neat,"Yeah man I made no mention of any of that, I don't understand how you got that from any portion of my comment. 

On that note, getting rid of police, military, and national guard would be a silly thing to do. They are all necessary forces to keep the state running. That does not mean they are without their faults. As I mentioned, we see new videos on the Internet every week of cops in the US commiting crimes and putting people's lives in danger more than helping. To me, it seems hypocritical to be pro police reform AND anti gun. We, as US citizens, have been extremely lucky to have seen little to no conflict on US soil thanks to the efforts from the state as well as geographic location. All of the disruption comes from within. If anything, we need MORE police but need to also raise the physical and mental requirements it takes to take and maintain ranks within the police force. Too many trigger happy idiots out there with a hero complex itch to scratch. We also need to prosecute police for committing these crimes and ban them from being to serve elsewhere once they step over that line, rather than investigating themselves and finding no wrongdoing

If you read my comment, I stated that individuals' self protection is up to the individual and the individual only. The support of banning something that you don't personally like, does nothing but hurt someone else's ability to protect themselves. I stated that the state doesn't want you to be able to protect yourself, as shown by terrible self defense laws outside of the home in the DMV. All the while, they allow violent criminals on the streets killing, robbing, and stealing and refuse to prosecute said crimes or make any effort at stopping/hindering these things. These sorts of violent actions allow the state to push agendas such as ""well if they didn't have access to guns, this wouldn't have happened"" when they would have committed the crime or a different crime anyway. They do this rather than actually trying to solve the problem. This tactic gets scared people on board with banning guns.

The state wants you to be defenseless so you call for more help from them. What is that help? More people with guns. Crime is going to happen whether you like it or not, so people need to be able to defend themselves with the tools the individual finds to best suit their needs.

Edit: to summarize, there is a balance of people being able to protect themselves, police doing their jobs correctly, and the state putting criminals away in a swift and orderly fashion. The semantics of it all go much deeper than I can comprehend, and I offer no solution. However, banning guns won't stop this shit from happening. Look at how the war on drugs turned out.",4,2024,04

1115,1ce7smd,meanteeth71,"I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm blaming the wrong people.  For some reason, you‚Äôre focused on the Council and not the actual police force, or the Mayor, who is responsible for directing them. 

DDOT isn‚Äôt responsible for enforcing real time traffic problems. If they were, you‚Äôd see them out directing traffic all day every day. The idea of that proposal is for rush hour and traffic emergency. 

Do you really believe that the Council has stopped the police from being our major law enforcement arm? If so, how is that enforced when they don‚Äôt have the power to direct the police? Where are the directions that they follow? 

Also‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs a difference between proposal and enactment. Legislation has to be enacted, regulated and explained. You believe that the Council has enacted legislation telling the police to stand down and the Mayor has so directed them?

I think that a lot of people don‚Äôt want to think about how action and enforcement happen. I think everyone forgets about the three branches, what their jobs are, and how they do them. They‚Äôd rather blame a city Councilmember than do their own deep level research beyond a WaPo article about what‚Äôs been proposed or thought about. If the Council was telling the police to stand down on all crime‚Ä¶ why? To what end?

Policy making is boring to most people. The Council spends their time researching issues and moving money around to make the city work in ways you may not have realized. The police have NEVER been defunded. They always get their full budget‚Äî yet the Police Union shows up at community meetings and tells us that they have no money or officers. They also refused to stand with the officers who were attacked on 1/6 because they didn‚Äôt want ‚Äúto upset their friends on the Hill‚Äù. 

Meanwhile the mayor is actually responsible for directing the police force. She‚Äôs the executive. She tells the police chief what to do. The chief tells the force.  The force has clearly been told to blame the Council. Where is the ire for the Mayor? She‚Äôs not responsible for debilitating the $15M that was voted for and then she characterized as ‚Äúdefunding‚Äù the police?

I think it‚Äôs easy to get mad at city Councilmember when you don‚Äôt actually get the way that they work (or are ignored by) other branches and agencies. Might be worth actually exploring more deeply than a few cherry picked articles on proposed legislation.

What‚Äôs wild to me is your unwillingness to see the extent to which the police have decided to stand down because we have taken away the tools that were unconstitutional and are trying to get to equitable enforcement. You‚Äôre mad because the Council tried to figure out to make things more equitable for poor people‚Äî the ticket enforcement is aimed at that. The scofflaws who rack up thousands of dollars worth of tix are not at all affected by any of our ticket escalating techniques. Poor people are. Same with decriminalizing low level crimes like turnstile jumping. That wasn‚Äôt a big focus of the police to begin with. 

The decriminalized marijuana laws were the big thing that made the police force upset. That, along with stopping the DC version of stop and frisk‚Äî jump outs.",2,2024,05

1155,1ce7smd,LemmeGetSum2,"Yea another group 100% made a certain style of rap the only one that would get you major money in a record deal. That group owned the record labels and distribution companies in the beginning. It led to more diversely talented ppl not attempting to get into the genre as a lot more desperate folks parroted the formula that would make you rich quicker. 

This began a cycle of ppl following the trends carried within the music that actually got the big deals. This was much like folks of other groups following genres like punk or grunge only those folks were usually spoiled or well off kids ‚Äúrebelling‚Äù until they were handed high salary jobs or inheritances, etc. 

I think y‚Äôall forget for example the criminal element of rap (which started in NY) shows a profound influence from Italian American and Irish American gangster culture. There are still many ppl who follow or mimic those cultures, but they ultimately get a quick pass to become what their demographic is‚Ä¶ one that controls decision making across all industries. 

This is literally you not being honest enough to admit how those cultures are part of the fabric of America and were mimicked by the group you happen to dislike more. 

This is a great American story of how the US was literally started with a mass of European criminals as part of its early population and as they assimilated into leadership, the group you don‚Äôt like didn‚Äôt even begin to mimic some of these behaviors until the 1950‚Äôs and 60‚Äôs to a degree that is categorical. 

It so happens the other groups by then had been raised in cultures that were committed to oppressive policy and action (we don‚Äôt have to debate that here right? Like c‚Äômon the 50‚Äôs and 60‚Äôs we still didn‚Äôt have a civil rights bill.) 
Anyway‚Ä¶ honest participants in this discussion know it could only be worked out through policy, but here‚Äôs the thing. The group you hate, who‚Äôs voters happen to not be the usual participants of crime have to always contend with one demographic specifically opposing or blocking any legislation that is decided to build up their communities, quality of life and status. 

You would have to literally be honest, get out of the way ideologically, and stop obstructing their participation in the democratic process to mend what took centuries to degrade (by design). What we have is a bunch of ill intended and often misguided whining by the progeny of those who designed the causes of the problem. 

The personal responsibility of the whole group that you disrespect with your disingenuous take is to vote and get laws passed to fix things they aren‚Äôt personally doing. Most Black criminals aren‚Äôt voting yet many bad faith White ppl use out of context crime stats to disrespect the non criminal tax paying Black folks and it is for sure meant with disrespectful intent whenever it‚Äôs brought into discussion. 

The key here is when the non criminal Black community votes for policy it can be guaranteed that the main and most significant opposition to their policy will be the demographic that represents like 97% of corporate and govt decision making‚Ä¶ especially back when this became a thing, and remains so now. If only that demographic would get out of the way. lol

Going back to the Moynihan report it was predicted that the racist nature of policy on one side would lead to degradation of the other. Your ‚Äúgroup‚Äù at least the honest ones, knew this.

If you lie on this form, it is a felony punishable by 10 years in prison along with a $250,000 fine. You will be found and arrested for trying to purchase a firearm if you are a ""prohibited person.""

>Like required training? No.¬†

If you want to carry a weapon in public, whether it be concealed or open, you HAVE to go through mandatory classroom and range training in most states (DC and MD are two of those states). This comes with an additional background check, fingerprint submission, and additional fees. 

>Like limiting guns to people with history of criminal records? No.¬†

Form 4473, Section B, Question 21, C, D, E, F, J, L all address this. I'll break it down for you since I know you won't read it. 

C. **Are you under indictment or information in any court for a felony, or any other crime for which the judge could imprison you for more 
than one year, or are you a current member of the military who has been charged with violation(s) of the Uniform Code of Military 
Justice and whose charge(s) have been referred to a general court-martial?**

D. **Have you ever been convicted in any court, including a military court, of a felony, or any other crime for which the judge could have 
 imprisoned you for more than one year, even if you received a shorter sentence including probation?**

E. **Are you a fugitive from justice?**

F. **Are you an unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana or any depressant, stimulant, narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance?**

J. **Have you ever been convicted in any court of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence, or are you or have you ever been a member of 
the military and been convicted of a crime that included, as an element, the use of force against a person as identified in the instructions?**

L. **Are you an alien illegally or unlawfully in the United States?**

>Like limiting guns to people with history of mental health conditions? No.¬†

Form 4473, Section B, Question 21, G

G. **Have you ever been adjudicated as a mental defective OR have you ever been committed to a mental institution?**

>Like the requirement of a gun license like people need a driving license to drive? No.¬†

Driving is a privilege granted to you by the state, not a protected natural born right under the United States Constitution. They hand out drivers licenses like fucking candy. Any 16 year old can do damage with a 4000 pound hunk of metal traveling at 70 miles an hour into a crowd of people 

>Your ‚Äúso much gun legislation‚Äù limiting excessively dangerous parts like bump stocks or expanded magazine sizes haven‚Äôt done shit.¬†

This kind of almost proves my point. Limiting these things HAVE NOT done ""shit,"" because all it does is hurt law abiding citizens. Do you think criminals care about the Hughes Amendment in 1986 effectively banning any new ""machine guns"" from being made and made purchasable by citizens? DC has a magazine capacity ban, do you think criminals who rob, steal, and kill care about that? No, they do not because you got gang bangers running around cities across the entire United States with Glock switches that make their guns full auto with 33 round sticks. 

>You didn‚Äôt say anything worth taking away. You‚Äôre using the same tires arguments that have been used for generations while we idly sit by watching more and more people lose their lives.¬†

This is just wild to me. It's not tired, it's true. Your safety falls on you, and you only. The police have no legal obligation to protect you, we hear about this time and time again. In the 1981 case Warren v. District of Columbia, the D.C. Court of Appeals held that police have a general ""public duty,"" but that ""no specific legal duty exists"" unless there is a special relationship between an officer and an individual, such as a person in custody. To expand, only 44k people die a year from guns violence. 52% of those deaths are from suicide. The remaining 21k people a year come from gang violence, famlicide, and other violent crime. Those are extremely small numbers. You wanna know what's wild? 400,000 people die EVERY YEAR from medical malpractice, but you don't see stories like that flooding the media and people taking to the streets for reform. Equal amounts of deaths every year separately for alcohol, tobacco, drugs, and obesity.

1228,1ce7smd,beanlefiend,"Thanks for your example!

I would argue that this is a poor example because Roman Catholicism is not Christianity. Their catechisms are terrible. For starters: The don't believe salvation by faith alone. They think that it is going mass that cleanses you of your sin, not Christ. They believe that Mary was sinless and a co-redeemer with Christ. They believe Mary was sinless. They believe that the pope is inerrant (unable to make mistakes) and they will reject the truth of the Bible to obey the pope, who is a fallen man (that's called ""papacy""). They do not believe Christ as their intercessor. It's deeply heretical and borderline blasphemous.

As for Catholicism, it's really a massive cult steeped in legalism and elitism and pomposity--the opposite of Christianity--but has zero faith and does not actually represent Christ. They may be the biggest and best example of taking the Lord's name in vain. They treat non-Catholics horribly, too (the amount of vitriol that I get from Catholics as a protestant is insane, and they treat my Orthodox friends awfully--they even call Eastern Catholics ""scum"" and excommunicate people for attending an Eastern Catholic church instead of a Roman Catholic one--what a mess!!). They are known by their fruits, and their fruits are rotten. Not to mention that they burned *actual* Christians at the stake for teaching other how to read the Bible. 

There can be *some* catholics who are regenerated, but bad (horrible) theology rarely reaps anything good, so that number is sparse.

Even if you want to disregard the above, this is another example of taking the Lord's name in vain, and therefore you cannot be a Christian influence whilst deliberately breaking moral law. In fact, remember when Jesus was being betrayed and Peter took a sword to fight one of the guards?

*‚ÄùBut Jesus said to him, ‚ÄúFriend, why have you come?‚Äù Then they came and laid hands on Jesus and took Him. And suddenly, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword, struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear. But Jesus said to him, ‚ÄúPut your sword in its place, for all who take the sword will perish by the sword. Or do you think that I cannot now pray to My Father, and He will provide Me with more than twelve legions of angels? How then could the Scriptures be fulfilled, that it must happen thus?‚Äù‚Äú*
‚Ä≠‚Ä≠Matthew‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠26‚Ä¨:‚Ä≠50‚Ä¨-‚Ä≠54‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠NKJV‚Ä¨‚Ä¨*

The kingdom of heaven is not an earthly kingdom. We put on the armor of God for the kingdom, not of man!

*‚ÄùFinally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might. Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places. Therefore take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. Stand therefore, having girded your waist with truth, having put on the breastplate of righteousness, and having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace; above all, taking the shield of faith with which you will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one. And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God; praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, being watchful to this end with all perseverance and supplication for all the saints‚Äî and for me, that utterance may be given to me, that I may open my mouth boldly to make known the mystery of the gospel, for which I am an ambassador in chains; that in it I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.‚Äú*

No assumptions were made in the above.

Thank you, I now have your example. Now, you can argue, first, \*why\* this is Christianity and, second, \*why\* this was bad and, even if it is not bad, what makes it \*worse\* than the Godless societies. Substantiating the above would fully explain your aforementioned position.

I must warn you, as not doing so would be a disservice, that by the historical synopsis of Manifest Destiny on the writings of John Winthrop, it is probably taking the Lord's name in vain and therefore would actually not be Christianity. It is definitely patriotic, but to be patriotic is not synonymous with being a Christian.

(I, actually, do not agree that there is, currently, a such thing as a Christian nation in the colloquial sense of a nation (i.e., defined by borders and law of the land and so on), or even historically, although I agree that there HAS been Christian influences upon such nations.)

(Unfortunately, when you make claims like this, you need to know the definitions that you use and in the correct context. If you do not know what is in the Bible or do not understand what is in the Bible then you will not be able to make a valid point against the object in which you wish to prove or disprove.)

(Do not misunderstand--I do not think that the endeavor of Manifest Destiny was a bad thing except for that it is sinful to use the Lord's name in vain, especially because it encouraged immigration and encouraged freed slaves to expand westward. I think your contention is that it resulted in the death of American Indians as a result of attacks on those moving west, but you have to be consistent with your viewpoint. You say that Godly societies are MORE toxic, ergo, you would also need to argue that Godless societies, these societies include the American Indians, for the record, who performed the same action did so more morally--historically speaking, pagan societies were known to r\*\*e and pillage and would launch attacks on others unprovoked, thus, I do not think you want to take this position.)",3,2024,04

Examples include (recently) Sharia Law or (less recently) pagans (like the Babylonians) sacrificing human beings. (B) You should read the message before this one and slow down a but and thunk about what I have said.

I am not being intentionally dumb. Conversely, I am exercising critical thinking. The question is *was* this actually Christianity hurting society, or was it people using the Lord's name in vain to commit evil? The thing is that I know that people do the latter all the time, as this is not just something historically seen. Just turn on your regular televangelist like Creflo Dollar or Joel Olsteen and you will see exactly what I mean.

But we are talking about history. I am looking for genuine examples, and instead I am told ""go read a book"". Okay, I have read many; clearly, I know history, and no, there ARE no examples of Christianity (based on the Bible--sola scriptura) being ""toxic"". My assertion is that Christianity, in particular, strongly influences ideology of western society (for now, but as we move away from God as our center, everything else falls apart--afterwards, they will persist for a time, but will eventually fall unless they turn back).

Again, this is why I say that you (and many others) enjoy the apples but you hate the apple tree.

In fact, your assertion that I am being ""stupid"" is quite hypocritical. You are actually submitting to a position but not actually exploring that position or thinking critically on the topic.

Instead, it seems that somebody told you something in school, or you watched something in a video from someone else's perspective, and you did not think further about it. The result is that you have a position and either you do not know why you have it or you do not care why you have it (which if you are apathetic, you are not actually convicted of your position, and you are being dishonest). That is the beginning of weak societies.

On the contrary, when I hear something, and what all modern intellectuals that you read about today like Rousseau and Socrates (in this instance, an opinion on history), I want to read about it, understand it, and determine my own thoughts on it. Moreso, when I hear something at in a Christian book that is not in line with reformed theology or Bible hermeneutics, I read the scripture that was referenced, I look at what the early church fathers believed, and then I build my own rationale for it.

They report to us supernatural and specific events that took place in fulfillment of specific prophecies and claimed that their writings are divine rather than human origin.

*‚ÄùFor we did not follow cunningly devised fables when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of His majesty.

And so we have the prophetic word confirmed, which you do well to heed as a light that shines in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts; knowing this first, that no prophecy of Scripture is of any private interpretation, for prophecy never came by the will of man, but holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Spirit.‚Äú

God did not commit genocide (more on this later)--(a) that would mean that God is like man and He is not, so you need to get your vocabulary straight, (b) why did God send a flood?

Read it (I behoove you to not bring up the Bible when you don't know it):

*""Now it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born to them, that the sons of God saw the daughters of men, that they were beautiful; and they took wives for themselves of all whom they chose. And the Lord said, ‚ÄúMy Spirit shall not strive with man forever, for he is indeed flesh; yet his days shall be one hundred and twenty years.‚Äù There were giants on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men and they bore children to them. Those were the mighty men who were of old, men of renown. Then the Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every intent of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. And the Lord was sorry that He had made man on the earth, and He was grieved in His heart. So the Lord said, ‚ÄúI will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth, both man and beast, creeping thing and birds of the air, for I am sorry that I have made them.‚Äù But Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord.‚Äú*
‚Ä≠‚Ä≠*Genesis‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠6‚Ä¨:‚Ä≠1‚Ä¨-‚Ä≠8‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠NKJV‚Ä¨‚Ä¨*

See, man has sinned against an almighty God. You do not set morality for God, He sets it for you. We deserve death, but in His mercy, he gives us another day, He is patient with us, and everyday that this body lives, is mercy to repent and believe in Him. Therefore, when God sends a flood, or sends a plague, it is divine judgement. He is so much greater than you or me or anyone else.

What do you believe?

You hate the scripture that you neither know nor understand so much that you're raging.

*‚ÄùWhy do the nations rage, And the people plot a vain thing? The kings of the earth set themselves, And the rulers take counsel together, Against the Lord and against His Anointed, saying, ‚ÄúLet us break Their bonds in pieces And cast away Their cords from us.‚Äù He who sits in the heavens shall laugh; The Lord shall hold them in derision.‚Äú*

Security lacks and there is no 24/7 concierge, unlike every other building in Navy Yard. I pay over $2300 a month for my 1bd/ba, which is a lot for the stress of all of that. Management has changed 3x in my last year and half of living here and while Shaniqua is very responsive (which is more than I could say for previous managers), the rest of the leasing office staff weren't pleasant to deal with when I brought a potential issue to their attention. Ultimately, the issue never happened, so it was a non-factor, but the experience spoke volumes and put me off. Very thankful that I haven't had major issues that require their attention.""

""When we first moved in (late 2020) we had a very positive experience and the Google reviews were actually quite good, but things quickly went downhill when it became clear that management was neither capable nor interested in dealing with problematic tenants. Some residents are unruly, and at times dangerous. We had large groups of teenagers sprinting through the halls at night multiple times, and at one point they pulled the ""exit"" sign out of the ceiling so it was dangling by the cords. Tenants would blast loud music late into the night/early morning on weeknights.

There were multiple violent incidents between residents in common areas like the roof and lobby, and at one point a resident attacked and tried to stab the front desk person, which is supposedly why the building got rid of the 24-hour concierge (a standard amenity for luxury buildings in DC). Other than removing the 24-hour concierge, management did nothing to address any of these issues, leaving tenants in potentially dangerous situations. The after-hours emergency line was non-functional, and because there was no front desk person when we got locked out, we sat in our hallway for hours late at night before we finally got a hold of someone to come from Maryland to help us. Police were consistently parked outside the building for one reason or another, and not just for nearby issues, but for issues with residents in the building.

Our hallway constantly reeked of cigarettes and the elevators almost always had what I'll refer to as varying ""mystery smells."" The elevator floors were almost constantly covered in some type of nondescript liquid. Someone on our floor would consistently leave loose trash or open bags of trash on the floor by the trash chute, and sometimes just in the middle of the hallway. We started referring to them as the ""trash bandit."" We notified management and provided photos multiple times, but other than putting up a sign on the trash room door, nothing changed.

It's a shame because the building itself is quite nice. We enjoyed our unit and didn't need any repairs in the time we lived there. The folks at the front desk and leasing office are very kind and do a good job. The location is super convenient to the metro and all the fun places Navy Yard has to offer. Unfortunately, there seems to be a fundamental failure at the building management level, and it negatively affects the tenants.""

1709,1bsof19,Good-River-7849,"DC made it difficult historically to evict for conduct cases and when they froze all evictions in the early days of the pandemic it created a gigantic bottleneck by the time the pandemic eviction freeze was lifted.  At one point they did give us a ""public safety"" exemption on the eviction freeze, but the language was so narrowly tailored as to be nearly impossible to use.  So today you have eviction cases for actions that happened years ago, basically.  

Just to give you a sense of the extent of what tenants could do, I had a client who had someone arrested for breaking into a unit.  The guy got a desk appearance ticket (at this time DC wasn't holding criminals in jail) and went right back to the building and robbed another unit THE SAME DAY.  Couldn't evict him.  Another client had a unit that was taken over by squatters running drugs and guns, who kicked down the door of an 80-year old resident to try to take over her unit thinking it was also vacant.  Those guys stayed in that property for months and months and almost beat still another man to death who went there for a family visit having nothing to do with them.  Couldn't evict them.  

DC didn't do one thing for us.  We spent MONTHS trying to meet with Councilmembers to explain the difference in eviction types and that banning evictions for bad conduct was bad policy, we attempted to meet with Karl Racine to try to get the OAG to do something to evict the tenants from the units on the basis of a nuisance (he sent an underling and proceeded to do nothing to help), and at every step of the way we explained law abiding citizens in these properties were being beaten, were afraid to leave their units to even go to the grocery store, and we still got nowhere.  

Councilmembers didn't at that time (and even today in some cases) understand basic facts of the eviction process and that conduct cases are much harder to complete than a nonpayment case.  They didn't understand that it was unrealistic for landlords to try to BS conduct cases as a way to tag tenants who were not paying rent.  Instead, the Council were just doing any and everything the tenant advocacy community wanted in the name of scoring political points.  Higher filing fee to evict?  Check.  More attentuated notices required to evict?  Check.  Additional licensing requirements to evict and raise rent?  Check.  More constrained background check process?  Check.  More limitations on what reference you can even give for a tenant that was evicted?  Check.  

That is how you ended up with stories like this one, which try to paint it as a problem with some greedy management company when in reality DC just has completely terrible tenancy laws at this point that invite bad actors into the City.  Entire buildings were basically ruined by the actions taken by the DC Council during the pandemic in the name of tenant rights.",6,2024,04

2172,1b5hykn,Visible_Leather_4446,"I'm not even sure where to begin with this, nor am I really certain this isn't an incoherent rant. But ok, here we go. 

1). Technology to track every firearm, you mean like a national registry? Because that would be against the law thanks to the Firearm Owners Protection Act which ""prohibits the federal government from creating a national gun registry by stating that the government may not consolidate or centralize records of firearms ownership or possession."" Or are you referring the something like the ""bullet ID program"" from Maryland that cost taxpayers $5M over 15 years and solved 0 cases. 

Also, throwing an air tag on someone's car without their knowledge is illegal and is considered stalking. So not sure what your angle was here. I hope you aren't doing that. 

2) Unlawful possession of a firearm is already a 10 year sentence and is usually attached to other charges. But you can write all the laws you want, it doesn't work if the DA doesn't prosecute people. Right now, the DC DA only prosecutes 2/3rds of people that commit UPF. 

3) Too many dudes with mullets concerned about their freedoms - I don't know any lawful gun owner that wants to keep firearms in the hands of the criminal. However, every time gun control advocates push for gun control, they take the ability to purchase and carry a firearm for self and home protection out of law abiding Jane and John Doe. Case in point Carol Bowne who was murdered by her ex because New Jersey didn't want to give her her right to protect herself  ['No one helped her': NJ woman murdered by ex while awaiting gun permit | Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/us/no-one-helped-her-nj-woman-murdered-by-ex-while-awaiting-gun-permit). Every gun control law in the book does nothing but hinder law-abiding citizens. Never has a Gun Free Zone sign, an assault weapons ban, or magazine capacity ban done anything to save a life. But I am curious, what would be some measure you could implement that would not inadvertently cause innocents to die or be subject to other crimes? And before you throw out the Australia Assault Weapons ban, I suggest you do some research before I make you look stupid.",5,2024,03

I wouldn't  risk it necessarily, but you're less likely to have problems in Union Market than other parts of NoMa and certainly other parts of DC. 

It's not without its problems - there was a shooting right outside my old apartment just a few weeks ago - but its safer than H Street, U Street/Shaw, Navy Yard, etc. It isn't going to beat the safety of the good parts of NW DC, but it also has much more to do, eat, and drink.

Well the actual problem is that we're a Plutocracy and some citizens (cough) are focusing their energy on being racist instead of identifying the actual problem.

Income inequality and concentration of wealth vs poverty is the driving force behind the anecdotal dog-whistley things you cite. Those phenomenon are brought on by governance that prioritizes profit over people.

It's crucial to clarify that this has nothing to do with ""Black DC natives"". The majority of us are hardworking and law abiding, to suggest otherwise is sadly mistaken and offensive. The issue is criminals and the corrupt and stupid politicians who empower them.

3530,19cjyej,bnralt,"Just my personal opinion. For a background, I‚Äôm a D.C. native, went to DCPS, going back a few generations. Lots of family and friends in the city itself and the surrounding area.

First of all I want to say that you‚Äôre going to get a very skewed idea of D.C. locals from the other two subs, both of which are mostly non-D.C. natives. The big one seems to be mostly people with somewhat sheltered upbringings in white suburbs and seem to have this idea that they‚Äôre ‚Äúslumming‚Äù living here. Back when gentrification was really taking off, it was usually longtime locals who would warn people they say walking around a neighborhood about crime, and these types of transplants that would laugh and dismiss those concerns (I‚Äôm not sure how much that‚Äôs changed, though).

They‚Äôre the kind of people who always say, ‚ÄúOh, you mean your from the city itself? That‚Äôs pretty rare here.‚Äù I usually respond, ‚ÄúThat depends on who you hang out with,‚Äù because a lot of them do seem to hang out with other successful transplants.

That‚Äôs fine, no hate. The problem is a good portion of them seem to not have had a lot of interactions with black people in the past, then hang out in groups that don‚Äôt have a lot of black people. They don‚Äôt take much notice of the numerous hard working black people in the city, see the few who commit crimes, and think to themselves ‚ÄúWell, I guess black people commit crimes, in order to be nice to black people I should be nice to criminals.‚Äù It‚Äôs a really weird mindset, and the people pushing this are (I have to assume inadvertently) pushing a very negative portrayal of locals.

Now I‚Äôm talking about how these transplants have a weird view of black residents, but it‚Äôs important to point out that D.C. natives with black residents of D.C.  aren‚Äôt the same thing. The city was only majority black for a little over a generation, and even during that time about 1/3 of its residents weren‚Äôt black. A lot of people who come here don‚Äôt have a good sense of how this city (and the surroundings) have changed historically, adding to their skewed view of things. There‚Äôs also been a lot of movement from the city to the suburbs and vice versa over the decades (across all demographics). Which is actually a good segue into the other D.C sub.

A lot of people here seem to think the other D.C. sub is indicative of ‚ÄúD.C. culture‚Äù and its failures. But if you‚Äôve looked around there, it‚Äôs pretty clear that almost all the people there are folks living in the suburbs who seem to think they inherited D.C. residency. This probably sounds strange if you haven‚Äôt come across it, but it‚Äôs something that‚Äôs not uncommon in this area. Someone who was born and raised in the suburbs will claim to be from D.C. because their mother grew up in the city before moving to the suburbs at 13.

My experience growing up here seems to mostly match what I read about when people talk about coming from a somewhat mediocre hometown. I don‚Äôt really love the place, I don‚Äôt really hate it. I run into people from school from time to time, and they‚Äôre all nice. Most seem to be getting along fine, but few seem to be really thriving. Many have moved to the suburbs.

I‚Äôm not going to say that there aren‚Äôt idiot locals who do stupid things, because of course there are. But when people try to paint that as being representative of locals, it‚Äôs often coming from an ignorant and cartoonish view of the city. Imagine if the worst people in your hometown were giving freedom to make life miserable for everyone around them, because some transplants moved in and had such a negative view of your town that they thought those idiots represented everyone there.",14,2024,01

Also politicians just stopped caring about crime anymore because the people who benefit from crime and chaos are those who are dependent on welfare and will not work even if a job is offered to them.

Also a lot of these people who are committing the crime have parents that do not care or enable criminality.

Something that progressives are not focused on at all is that one thing government does is create incentives... progressives right now are incentivizing all the things we don't want in society like criminality, laziness, antisocial behavior of many kinds... and they are disincentivizing the behaviors we do want in the society like starting businesses and having a career.

Eventually the ordinary working person who is not a priority at all is gonna get pissed enough to demand change. The ordinary avg working person should be the priority, not last in the list. Similarly, it's important to look out for the interests of business owners... they create jobs, generate taxes, and make the city a nice place to visit & live. Driving businesses out is just dumb.

DC, like many progressive cities, is on the fast track to being a city full of net tax consumers and declining tax revenue as all the net tax payers and businesses flee.

Also, this may seem unrelated to the native v transplant debate, but it's not. The reason is bc progressives have adopted a mentality that certain groups should get special treatment no matter how badly they behave... this is a form of privilege. This is very similar to the idea that natives should come first before transplants.

There are some real issues wrt the natives first idea that deserve consideration... specifically gentrification and people being driven out of their neighborhoods.

3564,19cjyej,4ucklehead,"This is reminding me of one of the silliest things I've seen on this subreddit... the topic of discussion was why do many young BIPOC were engaging in crime.

Someone said it's poverty and someone else pointed out that many of these kids aren't from super impoverished backgrounds and then someone swooped in to explain that the reason young black men are engaging in crime in such large numbers in DC was bc they don't have access to the ""halls of power and prestige""... direct quote

So a few things about that... while these kids are cutting school and robbing people, other BIPOC kids from their same neighborhood are in school and on track for college...*those* are the kids who will and *should* have access to the ""halls of power and prestige"". In fact there has never been a better time to be a BIPOC who aspires to be president or lead a company or what have you. Many companies are very actively seeking these BIPOC out.

The key to understand is that kids who have decided to cut school and commit crimes don't deserve to have access to the halls of power and prestige... if they decide to turn things around and lead a good life, then yes they shouldn't be held back by their past. But society should reward people who choose to work hard and do prosocial things like getting a high school diploma and getting a job, not antisocial things.

frankly i have a bigger issue with the way bowser has been selling off public buildings like libraries and community centers -- giving out 99 year leases to private developers so they can build high-end luxury apartments. i bet dollars to donuts there is some shady shit going on with that. bowser was tight with Gray during all the shady campaign dealings he had with developers. i wouldn't be shocked if it was discovered she was up to similar hijinks¬†",23,2024,01

Fast forward and we find ourselves in what feels like a lawless city spinning rapidly out of control. The velocity and trajectory by which crime is sweeping through our community is both alarming and disturbing.

Until we see structural change in the penal code I am afraid this continues. Our leaders are now followers uncomfortable acknowledging there is a problem and getting ahead of it. Sticking the proverbial head in sand. Not to mention if someone does bring up crime they're automatically categorized as a trouble maker or it's turned political. More sticking of head in sand.

The current state of things is in fact very demoralizing, hence with no solution or end in sight, the city is becoming a ghost town. Money goes where it's wanted. Where we go from here?

And imo the issue is centered around the way the administration has responded to calls for racial/social justice by disengaging the police from most ordinary enforcement work, to minimize conflicts with racial minorities.  Paradoxically this harms minorities worse, since they are more often the victims of crime, and since not incarcerating individuals responsible for crime allows them to have a negative impact on the well being and prospects of their relatives, friends, and neighbors.

So if you're trying to tell a narrative that crime is driven by *increasing* economic desperation, you'd have to account for the fact that the share of population living under such conditions has been steadily decreasing.

If you want to argue that gross income inequality drives crime, you still have to contend with the fact that *disposable income* inequality is decreasing.  Also, why is that theory even reasonable?  The poor tend to steal from the poor.

Thanks for reminding me that statistics that supported my point are available. The nonsense DC can't get a handle on is creeping over the border. As DC has no apparent plan to actually put a stop to all this crime, it will keep leaking over into VA/MD. I have no interest in living near that, especially for the price they expect you to pay, so I left.


You can also listen to the Alexandria Police Chief say the same thing is happening in 2023: 

https://www.fox5dc.com/news/alexandrias-police-chief-speaks-out-as-violence-reaches-record-levels

>A number of communities across the D.C. region are feeling the spike in crime. Over in Alexandria, the police department says it's seeing record numbers. 

>Alexandria Police Chief Don Hayes told FOX 5 that in his 30 plus years of living in the city ‚Äì he‚Äôs never seen crime at this level. It's now interfering with the quality of life for residents.

>All violent crime except for rape is on the rise in the city. Aggravated assault is up 53%. 

>In 2022, the police department recorded 88 assaults this same time last year ‚Äî and so far, this year, there have been 138 cases. 

>""We‚Äôve had a total of 48 shots fired calls for service in the City of Alexandria. That‚Äôs a lot!"" he explained. 

>""I can tell you; I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôve hit this number in this timeframe in the City of Alexandria, ever,"" Hayes said. ""So that has us alarmed. There are a lot of guns out there.""  

>Burglaries and larcenies are also up, plus stolen cars are up 71% ‚Äì with the most recent carjacking involving a juvenile. 

>""A 14-year-old carjacking a woman in the City of Alexandria yesterday, *fortunately he was caught in D.C.*, and the property was returned,"" Hayes recalled.

Here are a few findings from studies on crime: 

	NYC found nearly a third of all shoplifting arrests in the city in 2022 involved just 327 people, who collectively were arrested and rearrested more than 6,000 times. 

	In another study researchers found that 1% of people were accountable for 63% of all violent crime convictions, and 0.12% of people accounted for 20% of violent crime convictions. (Falk 2014)

	DC focused info: 
	A different analysis by the National Institute for Criminal Justice Reform finds that for the crime of homicide: ‚ÄúOverall, most victims and suspects with prior criminal offenses had been arrested about 11 times for about 13 different offenses by the time of the homicide. This count only refers to adult arrests and juvenile arrests were not included.‚Äù

You have to understand the history of DC and why it was once called Chocolate City. 

During the crack epidemic people migrated out of the city because crime was rampant. Many blacks stayed because they couldn‚Äôt afford to leave. When things in the city improved people began to move back‚Ä¶. Increasing the housing market. Thanks to red lining it only allowed blacks to live in certain neighborhoods until 40 years ago when the Fair housing bill was passed. This affected how much money went to schools and how neighborhoods were policed amongst many other things. The more people moved back to the city the more people began to move into black neighborhoods with higher poverty levels. 

The poverty and the crime in the city is the effect of Red lining, mass incarceration, racism, and the government flooding the streets with drugs to fund a war. So, to blame a group of people who have always put at a disadvantage is irresponsible.",-2,2024,01

4899,1aerk5y,visualcharm,"I'm new to DC and followed the sub due to the censorship of crime discussions on the main sub, so I really appreciate threads like this. In my opinion, DC is the first city to treat crime as if it were a drug problem -- with acceptability and leniency for reform, rather than enforcement. I don't know how the thought process came about because addiction and intentional crime are two different things, even if they have a lot of overlap. Even then, policymakers should have seen how open drug markets like Skid Row have terribly negative consequences to society and not applied that logic to something even more consequentially dangerous. I wouldn't be surprised if non-native criminals hear of how lenient DC is and come here to run operations, just as how drug addicts that do not want to get better flock to open drug market neighborhoods.

The longer they let this continue, the worse long-term impact will be on not just DC residents, but the country. I mean this as, the criminal activity clearly has greater backing. Cars aren't being parted out to put a meal on the table, that money is being funneled into gang activity that exceeds this geographical location. It also puts more illegal guns into circulation. On an implicit level, I was surprised to meet a medical professional who was driving without a license - they shrugged and thought it was acceptable. The leniency corrupts greater society in even this sort of way. 

I think people refuse to speak about it because the level of criminal activity here is a matter of life and death. When faced with it, the individual is helpless. Even with self-defense tools, how am I, a 95 lb woman, going to stand up to this issue? The best course of action is to lay low and hope things pass. I find myself doing that when I walk outside; I walk quickly in fear, with my jaws clenched, and hope my fear doesn't show. There is also the lingering thought that if criminals overrule the city, local law enforcement will soon lose their ability to control the situation. As in, even if law enforcement is granted more rights to exercise authority, there will be major violent protest from criminals who were allowed leniency this entire time. 

I disagree with the racial profiling that I see. I think following that line of thinking is incorrect. Instead, we need to be proactive about bringing the attention on the short and long-term consequences of a mercy-approach to morally wrong behavior to leaders and the public (like news media outlets). I remembered my trips to DC from when I was younger and had 0 inkling of the criminal growth here before I came. The more people keep to a bubble and rant about the wrong thing, the greater the allowance of how things are becomes. We need to be proactive about pushing awareness and crime bills; this is the nation's capital. We need to push the narrative that we can't let the nation's capital fall like this.",32,2024,01

4906,1aerk5y,MusignyBlanc,"Here is my $0.02.  This is not really a crime problem - DC is a failed state and has never succeeded as an independent jurisdiction and possibly never will.  

There are many roots to this.  The Constitution.  Racism.  Congress.  Poverty.  Those issues have been discussed for years.

When I moved to DC, there was a Control Board that managed the city‚Äôs finances.  The prison was subject to federal court oversight.  The school system was also subject to court oversight.  Other city entities were subject to oversight.  The DMV (a shared experience for most city dwellers) was punishing for residents.  It was a true disaster.  Wealthier residents had fled en masse.  

I remember that the school system couldn‚Äôt figure out what people ‚Äúdid‚Äù in the school system.  They were just paying people.  The solution was to have everyone pick up their checks in-person and then describe their job on a piece of fucking paper.

Into the 00‚Äôs, the city‚Äôs finances improved, the Control Board was lifted thanks to the hard work of a team of dedicated civil servants.  The prison was closed.  Developers started building in ever new neighborhoods.  If you ever had the deal with the city, however, you knew that things had not changed.  The pits of bureaucratic incompetency and nonsense remained.  

In the mean time, all these white folks moved into the city and couldn‚Äôt figure out why they couldn‚Äôt get a new trashcan.  Now they are surprised to learn where they all moved.

So here we are.  Insane truancy rates.  A defunded and neutered police force with a basic unwillingness to enforce the law.  A police lab that has been de-certified for years (how do you process evidence without a lab)?  A US Attorney‚Äôs office focused on J6 and unwilling to deal with the bs that is the MPD.  A city council with white ‚Äúprogressives‚Äù (people who would do Neville Chamberlain proud), a guy who thinks that the Rothschild control the weather, and a lackluster mayor - who is way over her head.  Add some poverty and the corrupt influence of social media on the young and old - and you have got the current situation.  

It is not going to be fixed.  There may be some patches and tweaks.  The underlying issues remain.  Everyone deserves to be safe. 

In the mean time, downtown is going to die.  The teams will leave.  The workers will never return in these circumstances.  And if the Republicans get full control of the government ever again, they will spread the agencies and their workers across the region and country.

While in for repair, someone tried to break into that same minivan, scratching up all of the door handles.  3. Someone vandalized my car. 4. My son was almost abducted by a car thief.  5. My son had to jump out of the way of another car thief in front of his elementary school (edit: Actually this one happened a few years after the others).  6. My son was attacked by a bully in his PRE-SCHOOL who said he wanted him to die because he's white.  7. I was accosted by 3 teenagers and called ""an ugly white guy"" right before they threw a rock at my head.  8. My wife drove through a gang shoot-out without realizing it (she's profoundly deaf). 9.

I hate when suburbanites and/or conservatives fearmonger about how ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù cities are - calm down, when a lot of people live together, crime is statistically inevitable. Whether it‚Äôs on Fox News or seemingly every big city subreddit, the fearmongering is annoying and usually wrong. I‚Äôm sure many residents of DC share my general inclinations on this type of thing.

The author's original post demonstrates exactly why and how we've landed in the situation we are in.

Crime is not statistically inevitable as a result of large groups of people living together. Some cities have drastically higher or lower crime rates than others. Compare Tokyo to Washington DC, or Austin, TX to Detroit or any city to any other city and you'll see 2x to 100x differences in murder, crime, etc. Minimizing crime and violence as ""inevitable"" results in making no effort to actually improve the situation.

Until liberals start holding each other accountable to reality and that it's not ok to just lie constantly to push a narrative, things will continue to get worse. Wanting laws and punishments is not racist. Talking about crime is not racist or ""soft"" or ""hardcore conservative"", it's something we should all care about and try to fix. Also not passing or enforcing certain laws in the name of ""equity"" is batshit crazy.

There‚Äôs a lot you say that I agree with, though I think you‚Äôve left one important thing out and I hope your advice to move is wrong, because I want to see the city bounce back. 

So here‚Äôs what we need to consider: this is an epidemic of YOUTH violence. People don‚Äôt realize how negatively the pandemic impacted kids‚Äô social and emotional development. I have a friend who for years has run a somewhat ritzy summer program for kids, and she says even those privileged kids are out of control. As an organization, they have acknowledged they have to treat 14-year-olds as if they are 11! 

Another thing I notice is people debate the value of social programs vs jail time. No! We need both! And frankly, the best medical care (including psych care) is found in the prison system. Have you ever talked to the ex cons who work with troubled kids? There are many non-profits in the city who put these ex cons in front of kids to both ‚Äúscare them straight‚Äù and to teach them solid skills. 

The entire city is being held hostage by about 200 to 400 kids who need some serious interventions. I believe if we focus on both disciplining them and getting them the help they need, our problems will soon be over. We can‚Äôt give up on DC.",1,2024,02

Yes, I live in DC. Walking distance from the CH CVS, actually. As others have ALREADY STATED, but you of course didn't read because you're just here to see yourself type, there are two other pharmacies within a block of the CH CVS, and several others, including other CVS, within walking distance.

I get exhausted watching your rant about shit you refuse to know anything about and make everything about crime. This was planned. This is how CVS operates.

I'm wondering if you've ever actually worked in a retail or grocery business at all.  Because if you had, it would be strikingly obvious to you.  

 This whole situation has been developing for a couple of years, and there's loads reported and written about it.  You can go online, see law enforcement talk about it.  You can see national reports that acknowledge what's happening.  You can see Target openly talking about it from the national level.  And then you can see CVS trying to be non-confrontational as possible and dip out un-noticed. They use words like ""reconsolidating"" and ""corporate strategy."" Walmart did the same thing until they could shut down the stores without confrontation and then afterwards  they were honest about what was happening.

In 2022 Target as a whole had a 57% drop in operating income, and in 2023 lost something like $500 million due to theft.  CH Target is dying fast, holding on for dear life.  Super obvious with the goods they're chosing to lock up and the fact people under 18 need an adult escort now.  And to me what really stands out as another indiciator is what they're choosing and NOT choosing to restock as an attempt to recover profits.   I know this from working in the grocery business, and also we saw the same death throws from H Street Walmart before it closed.

It gradually fell into disrepair until residents were relocated in1988. It was demolished in 1996 for redevelopment as mixed-income rowhouses (Ellen Wilson Homes). It occupied basically one large block berween G and I Streets and 6th and 7th Streets SE, intersected by Navy Place (Alley).

Potomac Gardens is a public housing complex for families and seniors built in the mid-1960s. It has its issues, but is not by any definition a slum.

But American civilization, American society, it is heavily corrupted. And split. 

I‚Äôm not talking about liberal vs conservative bullshit.

Patriotism is a critical element in a country. Something needs to keep a society together, and be the glue of civilizations. Doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs nationalism, religion, or language. Heck, it can even be political. A uniparty that everyone is a part of. 

People keep saying differences should be celebrated. Sure, but unity is more important. 

What‚Äôs a nation? There needs to be something that unites all Americans. Doesn‚Äôt matter their race, their ethnicity, their religion. 

My solution, if I were tasked with solving this problem in one generation: As much as I hate Communism and the USSR, the Soviet ‚Äúkomsomol‚Äù (youth party) was a good idea, and helped unify the USSR which was composed of 140 very different ethnicities. 

At age 18, force all citizens to participate two years in an American nationwide organization. Not military. But rather civilian work. Cross-states cooperation. Have kids that grew up in inner Baltimore be flown out to North Dakota and work with kids from Texas on building solar panel farms and parks. 

Completely interconnect the whole country from the youth level. 

Force people to leave their little silos and echo chambers and assimilate amongst each other. 

Military can be good for this, but this needs to be (1) civilian, and (2) mandatory. 

Government needs to be much more involved in the development of youth. This hands off approach is disastrous. 

There you have it. A nationwide youth organization that everyone age 18 must participate in. 

Other countries have conscription which is subpar but does build unity. This is one step above that.",5,2023,10

Is it snowing in space? 

1. WRONG. Since you're clearly too dense to grasp this, the murder rate is not a static number. As of 2 days ago, the % change from last year at this date is now 24%. Oops.

2. DC had 274 murders last year, its highest since the 90s. We're WELL on our way of exceeding the next closest year, 2021 at 226. 

3. ""Carjackings have dropped by 14%!"" Really? Car jackings DOUBLED last year, beating the previous all time record of 2021. But as long as 959 cars aren't stolen and it's only 600, things a GREAT, right? Cuz that's the current pace. 50/month.

Violent crime is not unique to DC but people should be allowed to openly discuss it. Many of the people who were bringing it up absolutely do live in the city. Again, if the restrictions on the main sub didn't exist, this sub wouldn't exist. But this is also why this sub is more focused on crime issues within the city.

Yes, that ‚Äúfeeling‚Äù has definitely continued to escalate since you left, but there is *also* a selection bias component to it.

Loved all the events, like Embassy Day, Solstice Saturday, festivals, etc. There were times I would go on 4-6 mile walks around the city as a single female.  I lived really close to Rock Creek Park which was super helpful. But after COVID something just fundamentally felt different. You mentioned the word lawlessness and that's how I would describe it too.  

When I first moved to the city I was in Columbia Heights a lot and then I'm not sure what exactly happened but it just seemed like it wasn't night time that stuff was happening there anymore.  I used to take the bus there and I didn't really feel safe waiting for it anymore.  U St. which was always crazy felt different crazy.  There was a sniper shooting in Van Ness where bullets actually hit my neighborhood a mile away. I saw teenage kids throw a bottle at a guy just for being Hispanic on the escalator.  Had a teenager get in my face on the Metro because how dare I say something about them taking up (laying down) on seats for the elderly who needed them.  So many of these things just over and over. It's city fatigue. 

There's kind of a point where when you continue to see things, you start to get hyper vigilant and I didn't like being in that state. I felt safe in my building and I felt safe in my neighborhood, but there's sort of a limit.

At least one ranking site puts Baltimore above DC in terms of safety. Both are near the bottom of the list. 

I think it is still very block to block in terms of targeted violence that might spill over (drug markets and drive bys) and you can significantly impact your susceptibility to carjackings, assaults and robberies by not driving a desirable vehicle, being careful where/when you fill up gas, avoiding high school arrival and dismissal time on the metro and bus (mostly just teens are unruly with a chance of witnessing or being a victim of random assault) and not being out near clubs and bars after midnight. 

I worry for my family often but theres things that minimize our risks. My partner works in Adams Morgan but during daytime its fine, neither of us drive cars that get stolen often to ever, I use a cheapo ugly bike to get around, my kids go to school in a very low crime area in a DCPS school with minimal to no major safety events and I reverse commute to work. Where we live in Petworth, is least safe out of everything we can control, but we are working on finding a more peaceful/safer block/neighborhood soon. In the meantime we are proactive when crimes start to tick up on our block and work with police whenever we witness anything serious or can be helpful to an investigation",3,2023,10

I‚Äôm on this sub myself because the other DC sub won‚Äôt let discussion of crime occur. So I‚Äôm part of the skew. But know that most of the answers you‚Äôll get are from people here for the same reason. 

Although I‚Äôve lived in DC since 2014, I have been out of the country for a number of months and just seeing news and discussion threads has me worried about going back. But then I have to remember when I was living there just 6 months ago I didn‚Äôt feel ‚Äòthe danger‚Äô despite living in the H St NE area. I don‚Äôt drive tho - I think I‚Äôd feel the carjacking risk. 

That said, I have always taken precautions - i.e. don‚Äôt have all of my money / phone / cards in the same pocket in case I get mugged and hope I can get away with just handing them some of it, avoid walking close to groups of people just hanging around, immediately lock my door behind me as soon as getting inside, had a mental plan in my head of what I‚Äôd do if threatened/attacked, etc. So maybe if I hadn‚Äôt always done that sort of thing I‚Äôd feel the need to start now. 

We rent our house out while we‚Äôre out of town, and all of our guests have reported feeling safe in the neighborhood. Because they‚Äôre just seeing with their eyes rather than following crime stats. 

The one thing I‚Äôd recommend against is buying a place right now. Come and rent for a year or three and feel out neighborhoods for yourself, as they have changed and still are. I would consider staying in DC proper when your kid is 3-4 to take advantage of the free Pre-K.",3,2023,10

Another Wharf restaurant recently had their front glass shot out.

There was a daytime shooting on the Wharf near the sports betting that had outdoor brunch diners (including infants, there were knocked over highchairs) rushing to take cover. 

Several parents have been attacked while with kids/infants on Capitol Hill, including in broad daylight.

There was a recent carjacking in AM/Lanier Heights in daylight behind the back gate of the zoo by armed kids, 10-12, at least one had a gun. 

etc., etc.

I've lived here since early 90s, with kids, including in some of the places you mention, OP. It is really different now. And the crime is much more random and often involves people jumping out of stolen cars to rob or carjack at gunpoint, hard to avoid that when out and about, kwim?  

With a baby/child, there is buckling them into car seats, getting them out of the car, being slowed walking by pushing a stroller, etc., makes you more vulnerable to crime. What is the upside in risking it? There is increased violent crime on WMATA, including during peak fares, at stations like Metro Center, Gallery Place, LF. Would you be commuting with the baby to bring him/her to daycare? VA and MD offer close in living, greater safety and you may save on taxes.

6091,17bcxz5,AnonyJustAName,"Have you had multiple kids in multiple DC schools over time yourself? The quality has changed in recent years even at what you term ""exceptional schools"" in DC. It's truly unfortunate.

With kids, often ""start as you mean to go on"" is useful. For OP, not struggling with possibly being underwater in mortgage, etc., family can easily get established in burbs, meet other parents with babies, build relationships with neighbors and can settle in one area with less concerns re: safety of family.

As someone whose family planned to stick it out in DC and DCPS, beginning in another era, now is not that time. OP will likely end up moving anyway, the trends are not reversing. It's disruptive to relationships and those are good to build as a family. In burbs almost all kids go to neighborhood school, can play outside, it's a very different life and in many ways a lot less stressful, not just because of crime. In DC there are less families on the block and the kids may all go to different schools. If kids go to a charter school may pull from all over the city and involve a lot of driving to playdates, bday parties, etc. There is less community. In burbs the communities for families are around the neighborhood school almost completely.

Should your kid be advanced or have learning issues or some sn, those will likely be better addressed in burbs, it's just the reality, and that is based on personal experience with ""exceptional"" upper NW DCPS over time. People sometimes end up scrambling. There is a also the fact that VA and MD offer high quality in state more affordable options for higher education which DC lacks.

DC Crime Facts documented that USAO increased prosecution rates after being summoned to the Hill for some ""oversight"" in May, so in June, his office only declined to prosecute 55% of arrests, down from a high of 67% of cases being ""no papered."" By July, that no paper rate had increased again.

If OP can buy a SFH, he should work with a realtor and raise these issues re: DMV region. I already raised genuine safety issues renting in bounds for the upper NW schools close to Connecticut and Wisconsin corridors and that applies to rented apartments and rented condos. Look at the MPD crime cards for various buildings, the changes over time are startling.

The realities are what they are, that route to what you call ""exceptional"" schools has a lot of safety risks that never existed before. Buildings in Forest Hills, Cleveland Park, Cathedral Heights and Chevy Chase DC were not being reported by MPD as ""nuisance properties"" even a few years ago. Living in a building with sex offenders and murderers is not what most desire for family living. So that leaves the route to the better schools as SFH w/fewer exceptions. And as families leave DC or higher achieving kids leave DCPS, it's having an impact.

It's all super unfortunate. But trends show no signs of reversing. If we had foreseen any of this, we would have made different choices. OP can't afford to be naive or overly idealistic, it is what it is. I'm sure better days will come for again for both the city and DCPS, but I would not count on it being too soon. DC used to be CHEAP when crime was high, now it is the worst of all worlds with high COL, high rent and high and random crime, including in the daytime and in areas formerly considered safe. After the shooting at Brandywine at 3pm on a Saturday recently, the shooters ran across Forest Hills Playground. The reality has changed really quickly in ways many families never foresaw as even a possibility.

OP, where will you and your wife be working? Is remote or hybrid an option? If so, would consider moving farther out for cost and quality of life issues. 

In the 90s when DC was unsafe, crime had more ""rules"" and it was CHEAP here. Now, more random and EXPENSIVE. Now happens in daylight, in front of witnesses, with LE nearby. The lax on juv crime AGs and USAO who declined to prosecute 67% of arrests for years (including the majority of gun crime and felonies), plus lax judges has made juv and adult criminals pretty fearless. 

The soaring rate of carjacking (prob going to hit 1,000 in DC in 2023), the use of paper tags, DC and MD not cracking down on fake or expired tags, means criminals literally drive up and jump out and snatch your car, belongings, etc. Go out to dinner in Logan and you might die from crossfire as a dad from Takoma Park did, Peace Corps exec, had probably lived in dangerous areas. Left young kids. The risks are genuinely higher and as a dad you owe it to family to try to be around and to keep them safe. 

There was a recent armed carjacking attempt on Connecticut in Chevy Chase DC during rush hour. There was a shooting at Brandywine and Connecticut at 3pm on a Saturday with the shooters running across Forest Hills playground. Mexico was correct when they warned their citizens about crime in previously safe areas. 

Even the flash mob robberies of CVS stores, etc, who wants to get caught up in that with a baby? If it's possible to live farther, can still go into DC for occasional date night or whatever (pandas will be gone from the zoo by the time you are back, alas) but day to day quality of life will be higher. VA and MD are also not as safe as they were but, way safer, and schools are a lot better. DCPS was on the upswing for a while but is really slipping back, which is a shame. 

The vibe in DC is not good for families at this time. Would be reckless to choose to come here now when safer (and possibly cheaper) alternatives are nearby. Families who had stayed are now leaving and the trends re: crime are not changing. Look up some of your former addresses on the MPD DC Crime Cards, bet you will be shocked. And, the ATVs still around and will wake up the baby. The riders have assaulted and even shot people, not just a nuisance, a risk. In Philly one kicked out the back window of a car that had little kids in the backseat, then confronted the mom, armed. 

You can find a better vibe, one your wife will appreciate where you can settle in and get to know other young families. If you move to DC it's almost certain you will move again fairly soon. Hypervigilance is not a healthy way to live and even all the ""head on a swivel"" advice is pretty besides the point, if several teens with guns jump out of a car or two as you are stopped at a light or walking or taking out your trash in the alley, day or night, what difference does it make? Even if you were armed, same, more of them. 

A guy was recently shot in Columbia Heights after leaving Marshalls on a Sunday evening, near the Giant, in an attempted carjacking. With a baby, you may need to run out to the store in the early evening, better to avoid those kind of risks. He had even given up the keys. 

It all sucks tbh, a decade ago was a very different reality for families. So many areas that had a lot of development, have really backslid re: safety.",20,2023,10

There would be shootings occasionally by the Valero, which sucked because I loved those sandwich places in it, but there were dealers there out in the open and I wouldn‚Äôt be pumping gas or eating there late at night. And P14 would have stabbings in the club upstairs but I only went for the food downstairs.",4,2023,10
6110,17bcxz5,AnonyJustAName,"Areas that OP mentioned have had large crime increases in recent years. Always had some so I would not say new. Daytime and in front of witnesses, with LE nearby is new.

Families are moving out of Petworth, would not recommend to OP with a baby. There is a lot of violence right near that metro and a guy was stabbed to death in the Petworth library at the computers next to little kids.

No papering 2/3 of adult arrests and AGs who think restorative justice is appropriate for homicides committed by juveniles has really emboldened violence. Day/witnesses/cameras don't matter anymore because the chance of serious consequences for the criminal are so low.

As someone who lived in some of the same places as OP, with young kids, I would not live there today. Lanier Heights used to be full of young kids, now people are moving/have moved. After the 3pm Saturday shooting in Forest Hills, I know renters there who have kids who are moving. In that area, over 3,000 PSH vouchers means you may be paying thousands in rent but your taxes may literally move in a released murderer or sex offender next door. DC has no restrictions re: CSA offenders living near kids or schools, Murch has a lot of apartment buildings nearby, you may be shocked at how many SO there are. 

SO are listed on a registry, no way to know about returning citizens who were convicted of very violent offenses. DC only allows landlords a 7 year look back for any crime, regardless of how rent is paid, so if someone did 8 years for homicide or rape or SA of minor, can't be considered, there are no carve outs by offense. Buildings used to require income and credit checks for all, but with voucher not subject to credit checks, etc. So a lot of what DC calls ""returning citizens"" are moving in and in some buildings they become the majority of residents, defacto overpriced ""private public housing."" Not a great environment for a baby if you have other options. 

So, OP, be very wary renting in the Connecticut or Wisconsin corridors which used to be a way for middle class families to access good schools w/o buying houses. Even Frumin has had to admit that crime has greatly increased, including carjackings in the neighborhood by kids living in apartment buildings. The PSA from Cleveland Park up through FH has had the greatest % increase in crime of anywhere in the city in recent years based on MPD crime cards and written about in WP. Google ""nuisance properties Forest Hills"" or ""Washington Post Sedgewick Gardens"" and think about if that is the environment you want to provide for your child, OP.

So some areas do fit your crime is new scenario, PP, others, crime existed but has increased significantly, esp during hours OP and his wife are likely to be out and about, with the baby. It's sad to see so much backsliding re: crime and schools.

I do want to call out that my family's experience with DCPS has been great, even with a kid who has significant needs. Their school provides more service at a higher quality than most private schools we've looked at in the DMV, not to mention other public schools. I know this is unique. 

Under Kaya, DCPS was leading the nation. Bowser's appointments have slowed progress and been milquetoast at best. There are still schools throughout the system, not just in upper NW, that are excellent. This is heavily dependent on school leadership, though, so it can change once one or a few leaders move on.

MC and Fairfax have some very good programs based on what child needs.  I know people who have tried to get DC to pay for Lab since school is not compliant with IEP, typically without success. They rue spending money on lawyers and the lost time and wish they had just moved sooner. So sad that that is often the answer. So painful to witness the gains slip away, eh?

I have only had experience with schools in upper NW, friends have been happy in charters or in elementary schools on the Hill, or at Basis. I don't have direct experience with those but do know it gets harder re; cohort, behavior issues and grade level learning in many schools after elementary esp if child is advanced or needs different help.

We are still here too, trying to hang on for a few more years until youngest out of school with cohort he grew up with. It has shrunk in recent years as kids have gone private or families have moved, people that had always planned to hang in for Deal/Wilson/JR.

I know people in rentals who don't have the ability to move, some who don't have cars and who feel very stuck in worsening situations that used to be fairly ideal for families of modest means, divorced moms, etc. to get kids into Oyster, Janney, Lafayette, Murch, etc. to thread that needle to Deal/JR or Deal/SWW.

In a lot of ways it feels like the compact families had with DCPS has been changed, but that it is true with DC overall.

Re: my older kids, it worked out mostly as we had expected, but if I was just starting a family today, given last few years, and current patterns, I would make other choices, and I say that with kids who are lifers. Crime is a genuine factor. Re: schools you can offer enrichment, get tutors, etc., for safety, we are largely reliant on a very weak CJ system. It increases stress in ways that friends a few miles away just don't experience. 

When I hear of people being carjacked with babies or kids in the car, or the parents who have been attacked on the Hill (that poor baby bashed in the face with a brick as the dad begged) it is so upsetting, and I am grateful my kids are not so little and vulnerable. The putting them in and out of car seats presents and opportunity as does being slowed by stroller.

I helped a friend move out of Petworth from right by the metro. Her neighbor had door kicked in. Hope you find someplace safer soon. I remember when all those little stores were opening up, it's a shame how much things have backslid.

Say your kid goes to Murch and makes a friend, say in 4th or 5th. Say the friend lives at The Brandywine or The Saratoga, both buildings where the recent daytime shooter had ""associations"" per Frumin and MPD. LE is frequently at both buildings, day and night, and there is sometimes visible dealing nearby, MPD reported both as ""nuisance buildings"" meaning they had very frequent calls there, they perceived security issues that were not addressed, etc. What do you say when your kid wants to go over for a playdate or sleepover? Do you let them walk over alone after school? At that age, if safety/crime was not an issue, would be fine. Do you let them carry a phone with them that they could be mugged for? Forget 20 years ago, 10 years ago would have been FINE. Now, lots more to weigh up than in most burb schools. 

Lots more violent crime on metro during peak fare hours, bus and trains. It's changed the ages people let kids free roam in many families. I recently saw someone smoking crack in a redline train during rush hour. People are often having mental health episodes.

Don't dress provocatively, while galavanting around in a dangerous area, alone, at night.

You know, its funny; people think that non-violence is ALWAYS the answer. In ALL cases. I'll leave you with 2 quotes:

""I  WOULD risk violence a thousand times rather than risk the emasculation of a whole race. ""

"" I do believe that, where there is only a choice between cowardice and violence, I would advise violence... I would rather have India resort to arms in order to defend her honour than that she should, in a cowardly manner, become or remain a helpless witness to her own dishonor.

But I believe that nonviolence is infinitely superior to violence, forgiveness is more manly than punishment. Forgiveness adorns a soldier...But abstinence is forgiveness only when there is the power to punish; it is meaningless when it pretends to proceed from a helpless creature....

But I do not believe India to be helpless....I do not believe myself to be a helpless creature....Strength does not come from physical capacity. It comes from an indomitable will.

We do want to drive out the beast in the man, but we do not want on that account to emasculate him. And in the process of finding his own status, the beast in him is bound now and again to put up his ugly appearance.

The world is not entirely governed by logic. Life itself involves some kind of violence and we have to choose the path of least violence.""

This is all not accurate. And while we should complain about DC, NY, NJ, Cali laws, but we should also not exaggerate or incorrectly state them and discourage prospective new gun owners or carry permit holders.

DC allows handgun roster is on any one of: Mass (and the broader of Mass's two rosters), **Maryland**, or Cali list. 

\- Cali is moot since it is shortest roster. 

\-Mass list is quite broad, all the major brand pistols are on it. and you do not need to comply with Mass Attorney General extra conditions to the roster which requires safeties, cartridge indicators, mag release no fire etc),  but rather the much bigger basic Mass roster  which is a safety test (drops/ can it hit the side of a barn, decent quality materials and manufacture, does it explode when fired) .

\-Like Mass, Maryland's roster is a safety test and almost all guns are on it. Drop-fire, and quality inspection. 

So unless you are trying to register a very rare pistol you are ok. and anyway DC residents can and have submitted very rare pistols to Maryland state PD and gotten them added to roster making them legal in DC.

DC does have standalone constraints on affixing a threaded barrel to a pistol (allowed last time I checked in Md) and more importantly an outright felony for possession of any >10 round magazine, even if you have no pistol for it.

 On FFLS There are at least two FFLS that service DC. almost everyone buys on line and has it shipped to FFL which is easy and quick. DC is a small town of 600k people and any bottle necks on gun purchase are not at FFL level. One drawback is given No. Virginia FFL costs run about $45, you do pay an $80 premium given the DC FFLs charge \~$125. But that is a one time elevated cost of that $80",3,2023,10

So in a scenario like the aforementioned ones, what is the solution to the person on the receiving end of crime?

6325,18ouj2c,purplerple,Those are some good ideas.   But in general it won't work and I can see in the comments why.  Many here think this would lead to a police state.  And that leads to why things won't change.  People don't want the level of criminal enforcement that can be found in cities like Singapore or Abu Dhabi.   I was just talking to someone that lives over there and they said there's almost no crime and it's very clean.  But the punishments for crime are very harsh and people here don't want that.,1,2023,12
6326,18ouj2c,JelloSquirrel,"> ""Why doesn't the powers that be, crack down on everything? Why not give harsher sentences to criminals?""

Because the DC city council doesn't want it and it's politically unpopular. Prison sentences mostly impact the disenfranchised populations.

>""Why not upgrade the doors at the metro stations to something that's harder to pass thru? And while at it station transit officers at each one and on the platforms? I get we aren't NYC but man we need more transit.""

Are free riders really even a problem for metro? Or at people mostly not using metro because WFH killed it?

> Also when it comes to the people that hate the crack down idea because it isn't solving the problem at hand about disenfranchised communities I have an idea for that aswell.

Can't wait to hear your final solution.

> Why not have it so that unless the person applying for housing or section 8 is in a really horrible spot (and I mean really bad, like single mom of 7 or something) or just a elderly person. The people living in these places are required to either be at work or/and school daily and must meet a requirement to stay.

If they have a stable life where they attend school / work they're probably not the ones in the worst spot.
Also, we can fix this issue somewhat by building very high density housing to drive down housing costs. Even the affordable housing costs more than what housing cost a decade ago in poorer areas, a lot more.
Also you're not allowed to discriminate except by a few things like age, so places that do this generally just limit affordable housing to the elderly.

Where do you propose the people go who don't have a place to live and aren't allowed to live in affordable housing?

> The kids have to be getting at least B-'s at school (kids above the age of 11) and the adults have to be at work daily. Also money should be put into the ""rental offices"" to host Parental coaching, AA meetings, and drug addiction relief programs.

JFC dude these people are struggling and you're gonna mandate they be high performers too?

> I feel like housing and section 8 should be used as a temporary thing by the people living there unless they're elderly or in a horrible situation.

There are states that agree with you, they tend to be deep red in politics. DC definitely will never do this.

> Also pay those elderly people to pick up trash around their neighborhood something like $500 every two weeks.

Less than minimum wage, probably illegal. Gotta pay them $15 / hr.

> We could install camera that run the facial recognition software and have it know residents of the homes and track who leaves and enters.

Why not just arrest all the poor people since they commit most of the crimes?

> Also the abandoned homes (trap houses) can become the police security offices to help monitor the areas.

Did you watch the Wire recently?

> The police training time should be extended from a few months to 2 years. I think officers should be physically and mentally fit. And they should have a regular test on both every year if they fail either they'll be on re-education/desk work for a month or 2.

You're gonna need a multi year program paid for by the state for this to work.

> Also there should be a higher outside power monitoring those officers themselves both in those neighborhoods and at the train stations.

The FBI does do that.

We should improve housing affordability not by broken and corrupt affordable housing policies, but by lessening building restrictions and perhaps outright funding high density low cost housing.

Most of the crime is committed by children. We should set up boarding schools for them and when they're caught committing a crime, remove them from the toxic communities they're in and send them to the boarding schools. Parents should be able to voluntarily send their kids as well if they wish to.

We should make the penalties for recruiting or encouraging children to commit crimes incredibly severe and prosecute the TikTok influencers encouraging them under RICO crimes, as well as local gangs.

We should empower police to pursue investigations and crimes even if flawed. We can mandate body camera for all of them.

Shut down the pipeline, by imposing mandatory universal background checks and rigorous mental health screenings for every gun transfer.  Gun transfers go into a traceable national database.  Every gun recovered gets tracked back to whoever had it last and if they didn't report it lost or stolen they go automatically get put on the prosecution as an accessory to the crime.  If they legitimately lost the gun or it was stolen then the person who committed the crime gets an automatic 10 years additional prison time unless they give up the person they got the gun from.  And if the last registered owner did report guns lost or stolen more than once they lose their right to own a gun because they are obviously not responsible gun owners.

As far as I know that kind of legal authority only exists under federal law when they have already committed a crime or when they have been charged with a crime.  My understanding is that Card hadn't yet committed any crime and thus didn't fall under any of those categories prior to the shooting, so the feds hands were tied.  Whether Maine or local laws could have stopped it is a separate question but relying on a loose patchwork of inconsistent state and local laws is what's led to all of these problems.  It's the same reason why Chicago can have strict gun laws that become pointless when just 25 minutes away in Indiana they have lax laws where you can still buy a gun via private sale with no background check and no questions asked.

18 USC 922 G 4 which is a federal prohibition of people committed to a mental institution. This means he was a prohibited posessor and wasn't even allowed to have a gun.

Here's the scenario of what most likely went down: he was a armed forces personell. Owned guns. Makes a lot of threats. Is involuntarily committed. Released. Mass shooting ensues. The DOJ had like 3 opportunities before the mass shooting to knock this guy out for like idk a thousand bucks? (Whatever the cost of a few lawyers is) They still failed.

And ""Loose patchwork of state and local laws?""

Every state has involuntary commitment. Like it's very much an established procedure in America since the 70s. Just like the process of obtaining an arrest or search warrant. Just because civil commitment is badly enforced due to negligent reporting does not mean gun owners are to blame because you hate guns and you think everything is the gun owners fault. 

As for the gun laws in Chicago and Indiana, those things have nothing to do with what happened here. ROFL. You're trying to turn this into a winning argument for the antigunners and it isn't working. The shit happening in chicago is a mix of poverty, soft on crime laws, and culture. A bunch of gangsters are bringing guns into chicago from indiana. OK so wtf is Indiana supposed to do. Are they gang banging in Indiana or chicago? Obviously chicago. So how about better surveillance and prosecutions of gangsters in chicago? The cops don't know where the gangsters are or something? Hint: they do but they defended the police SMH. Even if Indiana could intercept the gangsters while they're in the middle of purchasing guns, do you honestly think that's the best way to go about it? Dude. Take a look at Singapore. Surrounded by drug infested regions. They give the drug dealers the death penalty and nobody dares bring drugs to singapore. Maybe they're onto something? It has nothing to do with guns. If chicago and Indiana were basically the same exact thing and the only thing different about them is that chicago were more antigun and has a huge crime problem, that would validate the pro gun arguments even more LMFAO. And if youre suggesting that Indiana adopt more anti gun laws to make Chicago's surrounding area more hostile to guns, that is begging the question to the max. You're forcing me to choose between 1) Being soft on crime and anti gun or 2) Being soft on crime and pro gun. You then get angry when I say no to option 1. You pretend i support option 2 when I actually think both choices absolutely suck ass. I'm saying you need to choose between 1) Being tough on crime and pro gun, 2) Being soft on crime and pro gun, 3) Being tough on crime and anti gun, or 4) Being soft on crime and anti gun. We should choose option 1 everywhere and you think we should choose option 4 everywhere.

What Indiana is supposed to do is require background checks every time someone buys or transfers a gun, eliminating the loophole for private sales, and to raise a red flag if the same guy keeps showing up every two weeks to buy a dozen 9mms.  But there's no mandatory universal background checks and there's no searchable database of gun transactions that can help identify straw buyers.  What all jurisdictions need to also do is to have mental health screenings.

6912,17j7mvb,Maximus560,"The major issue here apart from what you have said is two-fold: 

1. Prosecutors: One quick solution that we can do in the short term with immediate impact is to get the prosecutors do their job. The main issue is that prosecutors are federal in DC, so local government has no sway over how they choose to prosecute cases. The federal prosecutors are focused on other things at the federal level, not local cases for the most part. If cases aren't being prosecuted, then cops have no incentive to arrest people especially for minor crimes. Minor crimes that aren't prosecuted or enforced often leads to major crimes later, since criminals aren't held accountable and know they won't be held accountable. Change the prosecutors to be accountable to local government and things will change quickly IMO. Cops and the mayor can't do shit if prosecutors are letting criminals free the same day they're arrested. 
2. Lack of Investment: One longer range or wider issue is that DC doesn't invest enough in  schools, services, homelessness, drugs, jobs, etc which are often the root causes of crime. This solution would take 5-15+ years just to see fruit so there isn't much point for politicians to do anything or care about these things, but they are very impactful. If we had better social service programs, more affordable housing, a better jobs pipeline, better schools, and better diversion programs, then we can easily cut crime down significantly. For example - most of the crime that we see at Starburst has to do with drugs. Cracking down on drugs isn't going to solve the root causes of these issues - we need to invest in housing, mental health support, rehabilitation programs, etc. These programs will take a while, and are expensive, so there's very little appetite on the part of voters and politicians to even think about tackling these issues.",13,2023,10

\- the DC crime lab that isn't certified which means evidence gets tossed

\- also the courts and the juries which have also fallen down too many damn times

\- and the lack of facilities for dealing with people whether it's turning juvies around or prisoners, which for example gave us the recent carjacking where someone just got killed in the resulting crash and one of the dumb kids involved was out with a gps ankle bracelet

MPD requires a college degree for most officer applicants, something that is fairly uncommon among law enforcement agencies nationwide. While I certainly understand the purpose of this requirement and one might presume that it would raise the calibre of applicants, it seems to have done the opposite. Being an MPD officer pays reasonably well and has great benefits, but it is an awful job with a lot of unpleasant and demanding elements, and everyone is going to hate you. As a result, most of the people with college degrees who apply nowadays are the ones who can't really do anything else with their degree or don't fit in any other industry. MPD is scraping the bottom of the barrel when it comes to applicants, and it's just getting worse and worse. Paradoxically, we would end up with BETTER applicants (and thus better officers) if we got rid of the college degree requirement, because we'd end up getting the best of the non-degree-holders applying instead of the worst of the degree-holders.

Speaking of MPD, their job is basically impossible. DC is a uniquely complex city and MPD is tasked with doing way too much. On top of the usual social-work-level nonsense that cities often assign to cops (usually leading to more violent escalations of otherwise-nonviolent situations), MPD also has a lot of duties related to the federal enclave and has to assist all of the other various law enforcement agencies but is always subordinated to their authority. Most cities have a separate sheriff department to handle things like service of process, but here it's all on MPD. Since there's no way to do the whole job, they do it more and more poorly. There needs to be a way to narrow MPD's duties as far as possible so that the officers who actually care have an actual chance of succeeding. MPD should have fewer responsibilities related to the federal government and fewer responsibilities related to non-crime-fighting activities. We don't need uniformed officers going around taking non-time-critical reports. I remember earlier this summer that my girlfriend got hit in the head by a random individual who was going door to door in Brookland stores throwing objects at people, and we reported it, and officers showed up that night to take the report and write down what we said in a little notebook and refer it to a detective. Convenient for us, sure -- but it's not like they were going to catch the person right then, so why isn't there a less time-consuming way to take crime reports?

Guns are a big part of the problem as well. Based on what I've been able to determine from crime statistics, there is a pretty large contingent of people in DC who are illegally carrying guns not because they intend to commit crime, but because they feel unsafe and feel a need to protect themselves. Those unregistered, untraceable guns are subsequently very likely to end up in the hands of criminals. We should make it possible for individuals without criminal records to [lawfully register firearms they already possess](https://www.reddit.com/r/DCGuns/comments/17cr76w/registration_amnesty_proposal/) so that they can actually be held accountable moving forward.

The other stuff is big, system-wide changes. We can keep petitioning for statehood, though I doubt we'll ever get it. We could do a public referendum to try and require different prosecutorial practices. We could make it clear that we want an attorney general who will handle juvenile crime differently, and show up in primaries.

It is now proven that the vast majority of crime committed by an extremely tiny cohort of repeat/career predatory criminals.

7079,182iq12,Gaijin_Monster,"Yes, it's a consipiracy where everyone is out to get you.  Since you were 8 years old, you and 41 other people in your local area were specifically chosen by the secret society to be held down.   You've been personally tracked since that point in your whole life.  

All the decisions you made in your life were not actually your choice -- you were under the mind control of the secret headquarters control room located under the wonder bread and saltine cracker headquarters.  All those times where you though everyone around you had to earn their way with education and accomplishments -- it was all an illusion.  They got a free pass and it was just a ruse to hold you back and make you not realize you were part of the secret group that was being held back.  Every time you outperformed the people around you, a secret task force went to your school and workplace in the middle of the night -- using fast ropes, wearing all black -- and modified your grades and progress reviews.  Those things you think are traffic lights?  It's just an illusion specifically designed to slow you and you alone.  All the other cars that stop at them are just holograms so you don't realize you're being targeted.  The secret society involuntarily makes some people commit crime uncontrollably. 

They're watching right now.  Better put on a tin foil hat to make sure they can't read your brain waves. Even better go out and take out a 5G cell tower, because that's the new generation of control device.  Also stay away from the rennovated US Capitol Building Dome.  That statue called ""Freedom"" at the top of the dome is just a long waveform antenna that amplifies all the mind control signals.  It's why the only thing in DC taller than the dome in DC is the Washington Monument -- the monument is a tuner for the antenna on the dome.  I hope you didn't get a COVID vaccine because that's a micro electro-biological device that acts a receiver from the control frequencies that statue.  If you go to a quiet and dark room and close your eyes you can hear the faintest ultra high frequency pitched beep it puts out every 245 seconds... that is the connection tone and that's how you know they got you.  The man is keeping you down.. you specifically.  If they have you, be cautious, because the next thing you know you'll be subconciously looting a CVS, or committing a carjacking.

I think Virginia has more wealthy areas in large part because the state is more business friendly and has invested more in infrastructure (look at 495 in Maryland vs Virginia).

Nova is very similar to Moco. It‚Äôs by far much more safe than DC. Arlington is extremely safe. 


DC has a crime problem and it isn‚Äôt the police‚Äôs fault. Police here are numerous and respond quickly. They find perps and stolen cars almost always. The issue is the people being caught do not get prosecuted. This is not an issue in Maryland or Virginia. It‚Äôs unique to DC.

7092,1b0anrh,Additional-Mood-2780,"A lot of the lower income people from DC are being displaced due to rapid gentrification. Instead of doing something to help these individuals they are funneled into the SE area of DC south of the Anacostia River. The rising population, rising cost of living, and lack of concern from the city on the issue have created terrible conditions in this part of the city. Instead of living there, many of the residents opt for Maryland (predominantly PG and Moco). 

Most of these residents end up in the area surrounding the boarder of DC and Maryland, which are unprepared for such a large population jump (especially it being lower income and assistance needed residents). The rising population, rising cost of living and lack of assistance is creating terrible conditions in these areas (see the pattern üòâ). 

We see this ‚Äúdecay‚Äù in mostly parts of West PG, however it is very dramatic in towns by the boarder such as Oxon Hill, Temple Hills, Capitol Heights, Hyattsville etc. Once all being very affluent areas but completely changing the past 10-20 years. 

I graduated in PG county 2 years ago and I saw the change with my own eyes. The school system become over populated very fast; I had some classes with 35+ kids, not enough books and faulty electronics. 
I have no facts to back this up but I also feel as if the zoning changed, we were getting kids who literally lived in the SE part of DC (definitely out our zoning) coming down to our school. 

This isn‚Äôt the only cause of the issue you are talking of but it is a major one that is overlooked. People on this sub will also pitchfork me for this but it will only prove my point more. The ignorance of this from DC will allow this issue you are speaking about to continue. This is why the city itself is seeing so much crime because you can‚Äôt just shove all the poverty into one area of the city and act like nothings happening. It‚Äôs literally survival out there the conditions are so bad, of course kids are gonna be groomed into this shit.

> We want to continue to be able to serve the community, but we can‚Äôt do so at the level of significant loss or risk to our associates that we have today, said Giant President Ira Kress.

> At this particular store, it‚Äôs actually worse, not better,‚Äù Kress said of the shrink. ‚ÄúAnd we‚Äôve invested a significant amount of money here, even more security here than any other store.

> ‚ÄúWe have no other choice,‚Äù Diane Hicks, senior vice president of operations, said Thursday during a walk-through with officials from the D.C. mayor‚Äôs office, the city‚Äôs police and fire departments, and the Chamber of Commerce. She added that other nearby stores have locked up all products in those aisles or removed them altogether. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been leaving it out for our customers, and unfortunately it just forces all the crime to come to us.""

> Some D.C. Council members have expressed concern that Giant might shut down a store that serves a ward of more than 85,000 people. Not only is a supermarket like Giant an important part of the community, it also is a lifeline for a community with limited access to quality food.

> Theft and violence is an issue in the area around the store, said Lindsey Appiah, deputy mayor for public safety and justice, who was among the officials touring the store on Thursday. But having access to a grocery store is ‚Äúimportant for public health purposes,‚Äù so her office plans to work with Giant to find solutions.

It's literally so bad that the deputy mayor has to be involved, because both Giant and the City think the store is concerned they're going to have to pack up and leave.  Thankfully it's a big company like Giant, so they can hold on a little longer.  Most stores could not do this.

And now (more) grocery stores are starting to fall.  And when you try to eat takeout or a restaraunt (because somehow that looks cheaper sometimes), they gouge you with hidden fees. DC is already a retail desert.  Now it's becoming even MORE of a food desert.

What infuriates me is that people deny it's happening, when all you have to do is go to any CVS, grocery store, etc, and watch it happening in-action with your own eyes.

I want the violent crime to go away.  I want all the theft to go away, from the stores, to fares on the metro.  I want prices to go back to something reasonable.  I want to stop getting gouged every time I try to eat anywhere.  I want to feel safe in the city, you know, like you would other larger cities around the world.

The military service I suggested ought to be provided would be a more expeditious series of military, team, and skills training, a focus on the duties and responsibilities of the military and civilians, with learning and specialization opportunities all within the span of 1 year.

We need to be SCIENTIFIC and accountable. Enforcement is critical but up river prevention even more so.

Would love your thoughts:

Deputy Mayor for Public Safety +
Criminal Justice Coordinating Council

Let's get serious about solving these issues

Thank you for hosting this meeting.

My name is James Salt and I‚Äôm a resident of Ward 4. A man was murdered in front of my children and me this past March at the Petworth library.

This traumatic event motivates me to invest energy in pursuing community safety.

Here are my thoughts. I‚Äôd particularly like a response from Ms. Appiah and then anyone else.

Crime needs an immediate response for the sake of accountability. Given this dynamic though, we tend to be more reactive and less proactive.

In other words, 75% of what we discuss should be up-river solutions - particularly if we are serious about wanting different outcomes.

The 25% is also essential and needs to be addressed, but we shouldn‚Äôt allow the acute issues to limit our vision of the larger, more systemic forces producing the problem.

That said, here are my thoughts inspired by a friend and fellow Petworth resident Tara McGuiness (https://www.newamerica.org/our-people/tara-mcguinness/)

We should be applying the scientific method in solving these problems.

We need committed leaders willing to take ownership of the issue and invest personal accountability. They must be willing to own failure. Failure is critical to improving.

Pilot solutions. Don‚Äôt approach the problem with an assumption of confidence that your solution will work. Demonstrate it and test it. Avoid confirmation bias and be open to changing strategies.  

Be careful with large solutions that are difficult to modify. Typically these solutions require political capital to start and are therefore difficult to change.  

Be careful with 101 solutions. How are you testing the unique contribution of each treatment?
 
Data feedback loop. As part of accountability, you need honest data if you are truly tracking the effectiveness of a proposed solution 

Good data ‚Äî-> test treatment  ‚Äî-> review data changes ‚Äî-> repeat. But you need to be dialed into whether you are actually moving the needle or not.

As a starting point, I‚Äôd begin with a retrospective study of crime data. Who are victims and perpetrators of crime, where do they live? Where did they go to school? What were the perpetrators‚Äô motives for the crime? (Policy Recommendation: As part of the terms of incarceration, incentivize perpetrators participation with a retrospective crime reduction study using increased privileges or increased points towards good behavior.)  It‚Äôs also helpful to allow time to pass before collecting this information from victims, victims family and perpetrators. 

What government or community relationships existed that could have been vectors for engagement in their lives? Given the general attributes of these victims and perpetrators, what ‚Äòcontinuum of care‚Äô or ‚Äòmatrix of services‚Äô can we prospectively deploy to interact with the affected demographic?  How could a consortium of partnered agencies and community interests: DCPS, DPR, MPD, Department of Health, DC Witness, faith communities etc. collaborate in touching the lives that need to be touched?

Moving forward: I haven‚Äôt heard DC leaders talking like this and I‚Äôm wondering if the Mayor's office-and others- are having this conversation. Are these conversations happening and who‚Äôs responsible for leading and reporting out on it? If not, is there interest getting it started right now?

Is the Criminal Justice Coordinating Council effective? Shouldn‚Äôt it be doing this?  Can its scope extend beyond the silo of criminal safety and expand into more holistic treatments that already exist?",8,2024,01
7506,1ac1l8o,frigidcucumber,"Well I think dc representation is problematic but also I think its worth noting that they do right at times. MPD makes arrests, bowser rightfully called out judges for being lenient and council has Secure DC in mind. Now I‚Äôm not saying these things as compliments. (I think Bowser should resign). But recognizing what is being done (and what isn‚Äôt) gives us a clearer idea of what demands we should make.

I agree that funding candidates who are serious about crime fighting is another tool. Despite cable news there are alot of dems who want to seriously address crime. I say that to mean that one can be liberal and still want to put a hard foot down on crime. In short dc can still be liberal while keeping crime at bay. 

DC council does see a lot of residents come in to address them about crime but more people going obviously is even better.

I know this is controversial but take steps to protect yourself. Profiling can be wrong but criminals know this and abuse it. So if you‚Äôre walking down an empty street and someone approaching you looks sketchy, be alert. While I spend most of my time in VA, I‚Äôm planning to attach an external remote control alarm on my car. If I get carjacked, I can set the alarm üö® on from a safe distance. Jackers aren‚Äôt gonna drive around with a noisy car lol. I know it‚Äôs a farfetched thing to do but my dad worked hard to get me that car, ain‚Äôt no way I‚Äôm making criminals trash it.",19,2024,01
7507,1ac1l8o,qcassidyy,"Move to another neighborhood. It sounds like these safety concerns are dominating your life. There are neighborhoods in DC ‚Äî and yes, ones outside Georgetown and other highly sanitized/rich zip codes ‚Äî that are calmer. I‚Äôve lived in several middle class DC neighborhoods for 12 years and never experienced any of the things you describe, or at least nowhere near to the scale you‚Äôve described them at. 

Another action you can take is mentoring a young person through organizations like DC Dream Center. It may just feel like a drop in the bucket, but in the end, you‚Äôre probably moving the needle in more of a positive direction than you‚Äôd be by emailing your council member every few weeks. The problems we‚Äôre dealing with, as suggested by another comment in this thread, penetrate far deeper than policy or laws. They are cultural, and they require deep relationships and positive role models to counteract.

Then the issues are charging. Sentencing. (Ever compare sentencing between DC and Montgomery County?) Treating violent youth crimes seriously. Maybe pretrial evaluation needs to be reevaluated too.

7588,196sio2,MakeMoneyNotWar,"For income tax that‚Äôs not true at all. Due to MCs much flatter tax structure, the first $100,000 is taxed at about 7.95% combined state and county. State is 4.75% from $3,000 to $100,000 in income. Theres brackets before 7.95% but it‚Äôs $3000 (so basically immaterial). MC is another flat 3.2%. 

So if your AGI is 100,000 you pay 1000x5.2% + 1000x6.2% + 1000x7.2% + 97,000x7.95% = $7,897 in MD state and local tax. For DC, it‚Äôs 10,000x4% + 30000x6% + 20000x6.5%. + 40000x8.5% = $6,900.

As someone else who doesn't drive and has lived in DC and New York for most of her adult life, I'd gently encourage you to recalibrate your expectations if you want to find somewhere you love.

I've usually had to make do with a small grocery store that's walking distance and metro adventures/online shopping for the others. And yes, there are fewer shopping areas in DC now and COVID did a number on small businesses, so when I want to shop, I go online or take the metro to Bethesda, Pentagon City, Pike & Rose, or Tysons. 

Finally, all reviews for apartment buildings should be taken with some skepticism. Some people only submit a review if something bad happens (and on the other side, some buildings pay tenants to write rave reviews). So a lot of places will be just fine, but nobody is choosing to share that info.

It's entirely possible to have a reasonable moderation policy: Allow comments in the first article that gets posted, but delete the other articles to prevent the same topic posted a dozen times over. The sports subreddits do this: When Ohtani eventually signs a free agency deal, the discussion will appear in one mega-thread rather than being posted in a dozen different threads.

This subreddit's approach is to not delete anything, which is mostly fine albeit annoying seeing the same thing over and over again.

For ANC 1B, our Commission meetings are generally held the first Thursday of each month, unless that date is a holiday. They are held via Zoom only unless otherwise noted. You can see all of our meetings and how to join them [on the ANC 1B website](https://www.anc1b.org).

Also, to see which ANC area you live in, I like [this unofficial website](https://openanc.org).

Some unsolicited advice: the more specific you can be with your concern, the more likely it is that your ANC can help get it addressed.

I've had luck connecting police with neighbors over complaints like ""I am worried about this repeated behavior in this alley"" and getting police walkthroughs in those areas. (I've done the same for getting the Department of Health out for ""I am worried about the rats in this particular area"" and getting the Department of Public Works out for ""I am worried about the trash in this particular area."")

However, when the problem is large scale, ANCs are not usually an effective avenue of dealing with the issue. ""I'm worried that a lot of people in DC have illegal guns"" is a very legitimate concern, but as a member of an ANC, there's really not much I can do about that. I don't even know how to begin approaching that problem, even though it's clearly more important than the one alleyway near me. Not to be to glib about it, but ""Do something about crime"" is not feedback that I or any other member of an ANC can act on - even though the sentiment is totally justified.

And one more bit of unsolicited advice: These meetings can be very long and very boring. Most of what is on the agenda will not be related to crime. Please be prepared to exercise patience, and keep an eye on the agenda so you'll know when the topics you care about are due up for discussion.

Also, please note that the various **Metropolitan Police Department districts usually have Citizens Advisory Councils (CACs)**. The 3rd District CAC (3DCAC) works with MPD's 3rd District, which includes U Street, Adams Morgan, Columbia Heights, and more. I've found those meetings useful for me to understand the various ways our public safety structures are breaking down. At the meetings I've been to, there are representatives from most of the various offices that deal with crime and public safety, including the USAO, the Attorney General, and various executive offices, plus the Ward Council Member's staff (or, pretty frequently, the Ward Council Member herself) and occasionally people from the Mayor's Office on Constituent Relations and Services. They all have different perspectives and getting them all in a room together makes it harder for them to pass the buck.

The 3DCAC meets on the final Thursday of each month (final Wednesday for Spanish-language meeting). You can read more about them [here](https://www.3dcac.org).",7,2024,01

Personally I think Brookland and Bloomingdale are very safe. Brookland is more family centric, someone mentioned it is more ""suburban."" I'd agree with that. It has a homey vibe. 

Parking can be a real pain in D.C. especially, as you've described, needing parking in the late evening hours. If that is important to you, then I would say lean towards Brookland just because there's more space and less overall traffic/population in the area given a lot of the single family homes. Bloomingdale and Eckington are pretty hard to find parking in those hours, in my opinion. Probably not ""impossible"" but lots of driving around unless you happen to find a spot by chance.",5,2024,03
