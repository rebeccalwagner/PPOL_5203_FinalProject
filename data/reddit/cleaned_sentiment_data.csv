k65n8fq,17ed6rg,Brinzy,"I am not a super nature-y person myself, so YMMV - but I live in Forest Hills on the edge of Van Ness. This is very close (walking distance) to Rock Creek Park which is one of the better attractions for nature in DC. Someone can correct me if I’m wrong.

It’s about 10 minutes from my door to the train platform, and there’s a Giant grocery store with a solid selection. I think there’s also a Safeway, but I’ve never been. There’s a new urgent care, a CVS, some reasonable (for DC) priced restaurants and some upscale restaurants, some gyms, and a UPS off the top of my head. Really the only thing I miss is a bank - there was a Wells Fargo nearby two years ago, but it’s been gone.

Where I live, you can go in one direction to make your way into the heart of the city, or you can go the other to get to nature. I live across the street from a park, and it’s about half a mile to Rock Creek Park. It’s usually pretty quiet here, for the city.

I am a full time student and work full time. It’s tough sometimes for me without any familial support, but I have been here two years. It’s only getting better as time goes on. You sound as if you’re in a much stronger financial position than me, so you’d do well here.

Finally, I can’t answer this perfectly for you as a man, but nighttime is generally safe here, for the city. I am a night owl and will walk at night during warm months (talking anytime between 8 PM and 1 AM) - I haven’t had any problems. But again, I’m a man.",2,2023,10,0,1,7

I have lived in DC for several years and generally recommend Bloomingdale or Takoma Park (in Maryland) area for people who like a mix. For those who want to live more outside the city and have a car, Woodbridge, VA is a nice place. That being said, the real estate companies in DC can be ruthless and terrible to deal with, especially in times of crisis. I have friends who stay at ""luxury"" or very nice apartments yet they struggle to get maintenance in or noise problems resolved. They also get hidden fees. My recommendation is to rent from people, not companies. Currently, I am helping my landlord find a new tenant for this unit in Columbia Heights, which is in DC but quieter. I wouldn't walk around at night as I am a cautious risk averse women, but this neighborhood, and Petwoth, are super nice for being ""in"" the city.

cb3oryj,1ieety,meelar,"The answer to ""how to afford the rent"" is generally to economize in other areas.  There are plenty of people that don't own cars in DC (it's totally unnecessary unless your work is far away and not Metro-accessible), so the money they're currently spending on car payments and insurance can go to rent instead.  Jobs do tend to pay more here as well.  The other solution to expensive housing is roommates.  If you share a group house, your rent is much cheaper than somebody who lives alone in a studio or one-bedroom.  If your max is $700, you will probably have to get a room in a shared house--that is very low for a studio almost anywhere in the city.  It could happen, but don't completely count on it.

As for crime, it does happen, but ultimately I wouldn't let it dissuade me from moving here.  Don't leave anything valuable--or honestly anything at all--in your car if you're parking it on the street.  Be aware when you're walking around.  Generally, these two tips are enough to keep you out of trouble.

Can't really help with the rest of your questions.  Good luck with the move!",2,2013,7,0,1,6

2) Smokers: Smoking stinks the place up & is expensive to get rid of. (All walls and ceilings have to be sanded (All surfaces really) and painted.) This is expensive. It's hard to find people who will do basic prep, nevermind sanding the tar off all surfaces before painting.  
  
3) Prices: DC is one of the more expensive places to live. It's estimated that it takes the ""average"" person 80 hours to afford to live in dc. There is Washington (The rich white folk), and the rest of DC (Everybody else). At $700, you are probably looking at a room in a group house, or a tiny basement apartment.

Seriously, though, you'll do well to use the [map search function on Craigslist](http://washingtondc.craigslist.org/search/apa?minAsk=&maxAsk=1500&minSqft=&maxSqft=&query=). Anywhere within a half mile or so of a Metro in Arlington should be (and even feel) safe. Likewise, in DC, most of the more established neighborhoods around the Metros (though perhaps less so on the East side of the Anacostia river) should also be plenty safe. Arlington has kind of a yuppie feel, whereas DC varies by neighborhood. There's usually a lot more going on in DC.

Depending on your commute to work, I'd suggest looking around the Columbia Heights, U Street, or Shaw Metros (green/yellow lines) or Woodley Park or Dupont Circle (red line). Capitol Hill (Capitol South through Stadium Armory) is also nice, but it's mostly townhouses. Most studios/1 bedrooms here are in basements (you could do closer to H Street NE, which is a great neighborhood, but you'd be more reliant on buses to get to the Metro). 

Also, you'll likely see a lot of listings for Crystal City in Arlington. It's very safe, so don't be scared of it, but it's also an exceptionally boring neighborhood that gets nearly dead at night. Most things happening there are the primary landlord's (Vornado) attempts to make it seem hip.

In my profession an old mentor of mine told me, “crime is a choice.” By that he meant, we live in a country where our politicians have decided that a certain amount of crime — even violent crime — is acceptable. Could they eliminate most of this stuff? Of course. But they choose not to.

Many of the problems discussed on this subreddit could vanish in a weekend if the politicians allowed it, without violating a single civil right.

On that note, getting rid of police, military, and national guard would be a silly thing to do. They are all necessary forces to keep the state running. That does not mean they are without their faults. As I mentioned, we see new videos on the Internet every week of cops in the US commiting crimes and putting people's lives in danger more than helping. To me, it seems hypocritical to be pro police reform AND anti gun. We, as US citizens, have been extremely lucky to have seen little to no conflict on US soil thanks to the efforts from the state as well as geographic location. All of the disruption comes from within. If anything, we need MORE police but need to also raise the physical and mental requirements it takes to take and maintain ranks within the police force. Too many trigger happy idiots out there with a hero complex itch to scratch. We also need to prosecute police for committing these crimes and ban them from being to serve elsewhere once they step over that line, rather than investigating themselves and finding no wrongdoing

If you read my comment, I stated that individuals' self protection is up to the individual and the individual only. The support of banning something that you don't personally like, does nothing but hurt someone else's ability to protect themselves. I stated that the state doesn't want you to be able to protect yourself, as shown by terrible self defense laws outside of the home in the DMV. All the while, they allow violent criminals on the streets killing, robbing, and stealing and refuse to prosecute said crimes or make any effort at stopping/hindering these things. These sorts of violent actions allow the state to push agendas such as ""well if they didn't have access to guns, this wouldn't have happened"" when they would have committed the crime or a different crime anyway. They do this rather than actually trying to solve the problem. This tactic gets scared people on board with banning guns.

The state wants you to be defenseless so you call for more help from them. What is that help? More people with guns. Crime is going to happen whether you like it or not, so people need to be able to defend themselves with the tools the individual finds to best suit their needs.

Edit: to summarize, there is a balance of people being able to protect themselves, police doing their jobs correctly, and the state putting criminals away in a swift and orderly fashion.

DDOT isn’t responsible for enforcing real time traffic problems. If they were, you’d see them out directing traffic all day every day. The idea of that proposal is for rush hour and traffic emergency. 

Do you really believe that the Council has stopped the police from being our major law enforcement arm? If so, how is that enforced when they don’t have the power to direct the police? Where are the directions that they follow? 

Also… there’s a difference between proposal and enactment. Legislation has to be enacted, regulated and explained. You believe that the Council has enacted legislation telling the police to stand down and the Mayor has so directed them?

I think that a lot of people don’t want to think about how action and enforcement happen. I think everyone forgets about the three branches, what their jobs are, and how they do them. They’d rather blame a city Councilmember than do their own deep level research beyond a WaPo article about what’s been proposed or thought about. If the Council was telling the police to stand down on all crime… why? To what end?

Policy making is boring to most people. The Council spends their time researching issues and moving money around to make the city work in ways you may not have realized. The police have NEVER been defunded. They always get their full budget— yet the Police Union shows up at community meetings and tells us that they have no money or officers. They also refused to stand with the officers who were attacked on 1/6 because they didn’t want “to upset their friends on the Hill”. 

Meanwhile the mayor is actually responsible for directing the police force. She’s the executive. She tells the police chief what to do. The chief tells the force.  The force has clearly been told to blame the Council. Where is the ire for the Mayor? She’s not responsible for debilitating the $15M that was voted for and then she characterized as “defunding” the police?

I think it’s easy to get mad at city Councilmember when you don’t actually get the way that they work (or are ignored by) other branches and agencies. Might be worth actually exploring more deeply than a few cherry picked articles on proposed legislation.

What’s wild to me is your unwillingness to see the extent to which the police have decided to stand down because we have taken away the tools that were unconstitutional and are trying to get to equitable enforcement. You’re mad because the Council tried to figure out to make things more equitable for poor people— the ticket enforcement is aimed at that. The scofflaws who rack up thousands of dollars worth of tix are not at all affected by any of our ticket escalating techniques. Poor people are.

At that point, the legislators have to take some blame for their actions. 

Also, advocating for the police to be able to stop people who run red lights isn’t part of a misplaced adherence to the broken windows theory. I simply don’t want my daughter hit by a car on her way to school. Right now, there are zero repercussions in DC to running reds and stop signs.

For reference, I will be using the US DOJ/ATF form 4473, which is a Firearms Transaction Record (I encourage you to look up the form). It is LEGALLY required to fill one of these out for EACH firearm purchase you make in the United States, along with whatever additional forms/information your state requires. This form also serves as a comprehensive background check by the FBI NICS. Any LEGAL gun dealer with a valid FFL (Federal Firearms License) is required by law to have you fill out this form in the US, and will not hand a firearm over to you until you fill out this form and it comes back 100% clean. If you lie on this form, it is a felony punishable by 10 years in prison along with a $250,000 fine. You will be found and arrested for trying to purchase a firearm if you are a ""prohibited person.""

>Like required training? No. 

If you want to carry a weapon in public, whether it be concealed or open, you HAVE to go through mandatory classroom and range training in most states (DC and MD are two of those states). This comes with an additional background check, fingerprint submission, and additional fees. 

>Like limiting guns to people with history of criminal records? No. 

Form 4473, Section B, Question 21, C, D, E, F, J, L all address this. I'll break it down for you since I know you won't read it.

E. **Are you a fugitive from justice?**

F. **Are you an unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana or any depressant, stimulant, narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance?**

J. **Have you ever been convicted in any court of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence, or are you or have you ever been a member of 
the military and been convicted of a crime that included, as an element, the use of force against a person as identified in the instructions?**

L. **Are you an alien illegally or unlawfully in the United States?**

G. **Have you ever been adjudicated as a mental defective OR have you ever been committed to a mental institution?**

>Like the requirement of a gun license like people need a driving license to drive? No. 

Driving is a privilege granted to you by the state, not a protected natural born right under the United States Constitution. They hand out drivers licenses like fucking candy. Any 16 year old can do damage with a 4000 pound hunk of metal traveling at 70 miles an hour into a crowd of people 

>Your “so much gun legislation” limiting excessively dangerous parts like bump stocks or expanded magazine sizes haven’t done shit. 

This kind of almost proves my point. Limiting these things HAVE NOT done ""shit,"" because all it does is hurt law abiding citizens. Do you think criminals care about the Hughes Amendment in 1986 effectively banning any new ""machine guns"" from being made and made purchasable by citizens? DC has a magazine capacity ban, do you think criminals who rob, steal, and kill care about that? No, they do not because you got gang bangers running around cities across the entire United States with Glock switches that make their guns full auto with 33 round sticks. 

>You didn’t say anything worth taking away. You’re using the same tires arguments that have been used for generations while we idly sit by watching more and more people lose their lives. 

This is just wild to me. It's not tired, it's true. Your safety falls on you, and you only. The police have no legal obligation to protect you, we hear about this time and time again. In the 1981 case Warren v. District of Columbia, the D.C. Court of Appeals held that police have a general ""public duty,"" but that ""no specific legal duty exists"" unless there is a special relationship between an officer and an individual, such as a person in custody. To expand, only 44k people die a year from guns violence. 52% of those deaths are from suicide. The remaining 21k people a year come from gang violence, famlicide, and other violent crime. Those are extremely small numbers. You wanna know what's wild? 400,000 people die EVERY YEAR from medical malpractice, but you don't see stories like that flooding the media and people taking to the streets for reform. Equal amounts of deaths every year separately for alcohol, tobacco, drugs, and obesity.

I have seen police officers addressing things selectively; I have also paid close attention to what they say, what the union says and what the law says.

I actually have faith in policy making.

I agree that no one wants police shootouts or reckless high speed chases for traffic violations (which also makes everyone less safe), but we seem to have gone in the extreme opposite direction, with no enforcement or repercussions of any kind.

Change requires patience. So yeah, we are in another really bad crime period. But most people don’t want to fix what causes it, because then THEY would be uncomfortable, too. And that’s not who should be uncomfortable, apparently. 

The people working on the issue have to make all the middle class tax payers who don’t feel they should endure any moments of discomfort feel good. But that middle class taxpayers like me get to suffer because we are the ones who still get swept up in the jump outs people love; our kids get arrested “by accident” and everyone says, well— at least they let them go-, and we all get blamed for the city’s ills because clearly we just “let” it get that way.  There are two different experiences of middle class DC. Mine, however, is constantly discounted as exaggerated and “hating” the police, despite seeing them pick and choose about enforcement. You thought I hated the cops because I said this. Meanwhile my experience is completely different, apparently, than yours. Should I discount it?

I don’t think you get what it’s like to work on these issues. No one feels they have the perfect answer. We all feel like we need to solve the real time problems because we want our daughters, sons, parents, and selves to be safe too. 

You know how many times *I* have been accused of illegal behavior based on how I look? Not by cops. By my white neighbors. So many insane conversations and accusations, while also trying to balance the budget? That’s my core frustration. The automatic— “oh you hate cops” “oh you don’t like white people” “oh you don’t care about MY child” without thinking what you communicate with that. It says you don’t care about me or my family— because you’re the priority, somehow. The staffers who work in this deal with nastiness all day as a direct result of this— somehow they are not people worthy of any kind of human interaction. Just dumbasses who don’t know what the general public who don’t work on these issues know. 

You believe there’s an inability to admit things aren’t working. I think there is an inability to recognize that our votership genuinely believes that some people are more equal than others. And they lie at the polls, in their neighborhood schools and in their blocks about who they find to be valuable members of this community. We know what is and isn’t working and try to course correct. Your neighbors come to community meetings with a smile and then call the cops on my father for trying to return their trash bin. Or on my nephews for sitting on the front of our house. Or me for standing on the corner waiting for one of them in jeans— because I’m a sex worker, obviously. 


Maybe change some of your assumptions to thinking we are all humans trying to succeed and help each other. And that none of us are perfect at it— but those of us who choose to work on these issues are actually coming at it with a desire to balance things for everyone, and it’s difficult and worth a thoughtful conversation versus negativity and accusations. Thanks for the positive exchange.",1,2024,5,1,1,5

We saw the upstick in crimes due to race-driven policies; attempts at making criminal justice more racially equitable. It's failed miserably. This became about race when the policies that enabled crime were done with race in mind. Reducing crime correspondingly must be done with race in mind. There's no other way because winding back race-driven policies inevitably invoke judgment calls about race.

Kids should know their lives doesn’t have to imitate certain things depicted by art.

Security lacks and there is no 24/7 concierge, unlike every other building in Navy Yard. I pay over $2300 a month for my 1bd/ba, which is a lot for the stress of all of that. Management has changed 3x in my last year and half of living here and while Shaniqua is very responsive (which is more than I could say for previous managers), the rest of the leasing office staff weren't pleasant to deal with when I brought a potential issue to their attention. Ultimately, the issue never happened, so it was a non-factor, but the experience spoke volumes and put me off. Very thankful that I haven't had major issues that require their attention.""

""When we first moved in (late 2020) we had a very positive experience and the Google reviews were actually quite good, but things quickly went downhill when it became clear that management was neither capable nor interested in dealing with problematic tenants. Some residents are unruly, and at times dangerous. We had large groups of teenagers sprinting through the halls at night multiple times, and at one point they pulled the ""exit"" sign out of the ceiling so it was dangling by the cords. Tenants would blast loud music late into the night/early morning on weeknights.

There were multiple violent incidents between residents in common areas like the roof and lobby, and at one point a resident attacked and tried to stab the front desk person, which is supposedly why the building got rid of the 24-hour concierge (a standard amenity for luxury buildings in DC). Other than removing the 24-hour concierge, management did nothing to address any of these issues, leaving tenants in potentially dangerous situations. The after-hours emergency line was non-functional, and because there was no front desk person when we got locked out, we sat in our hallway for hours late at night before we finally got a hold of someone to come from Maryland to help us. Police were consistently parked outside the building for one reason or another, and not just for nearby issues, but for issues with residents in the building.

Our hallway constantly reeked of cigarettes and the elevators almost always had what I'll refer to as varying ""mystery smells."" The elevator floors were almost constantly covered in some type of nondescript liquid. Someone on our floor would consistently leave loose trash or open bags of trash on the floor by the trash chute, and sometimes just in the middle of the hallway. We started referring to them as the ""trash bandit."" We notified management and provided photos multiple times, but other than putting up a sign on the trash room door, nothing changed.

It's a shame because the building itself is quite nice. We enjoyed our unit and didn't need any repairs in the time we lived there. The folks at the front desk and leasing office are very kind and do a good job. The location is super convenient to the metro and all the fun places Navy Yard has to offer. Unfortunately, there seems to be a fundamental failure at the building management level, and it negatively affects the tenants.""

kxke69i,1bsof19,Good-River-7849,"DC made it difficult historically to evict for conduct cases and when they froze all evictions in the early days of the pandemic it created a gigantic bottleneck by the time the pandemic eviction freeze was lifted.  At one point they did give us a ""public safety"" exemption on the eviction freeze, but the language was so narrowly tailored as to be nearly impossible to use.  So today you have eviction cases for actions that happened years ago, basically.  

Just to give you a sense of the extent of what tenants could do, I had a client who had someone arrested for breaking into a unit.  The guy got a desk appearance ticket (at this time DC wasn't holding criminals in jail) and went right back to the building and robbed another unit THE SAME DAY.  Couldn't evict him.  Another client had a unit that was taken over by squatters running drugs and guns, who kicked down the door of an 80-year old resident to try to take over her unit thinking it was also vacant.  Those guys stayed in that property for months and months and almost beat still another man to death who went there for a family visit having nothing to do with them.  Couldn't evict them.  

DC didn't do one thing for us.  We spent MONTHS trying to meet with Councilmembers to explain the difference in eviction types and that banning evictions for bad conduct was bad policy, we attempted to meet with Karl Racine to try to get the OAG to do something to evict the tenants from the units on the basis of a nuisance (he sent an underling and proceeded to do nothing to help), and at every step of the way we explained law abiding citizens in these properties were being beaten, were afraid to leave their units to even go to the grocery store, and we still got nowhere.  

Councilmembers didn't at that time (and even today in some cases) understand basic facts of the eviction process and that conduct cases are much harder to complete than a nonpayment case.  They didn't understand that it was unrealistic for landlords to try to BS conduct cases as a way to tag tenants who were not paying rent.  Instead, the Council were just doing any and everything the tenant advocacy community wanted in the name of scoring political points.  Higher filing fee to evict?  Check.  More attentuated notices required to evict?  Check.  Additional licensing requirements to evict and raise rent?  Check.  More constrained background check process?  Check.  More limitations on what reference you can even give for a tenant that was evicted?  Check.  

That is how you ended up with stories like this one, which try to paint it as a problem with some greedy management company when in reality DC just has completely terrible tenancy laws at this point that invite bad actors into the City.

Make a felony with up to 30 or 40 years in prison for any unlawful gun possession  and you’ll see how fast the problem is solved. There are tons of effective measures applicable but way too many more dudes with mullets concerned about their freedoms. In the meantime innocents keep dying",0,2024,3,1,1,4

They have that many people in prison because there are so many people in the state. So they let criminals do what they want. No chase laws, no accountability. DC’s headed there next.",1,2024,3,1,1,3
ktbumrz,1b5hykn,Visible_Leather_4446,"I'm not even sure where to begin with this, nor am I really certain this isn't an incoherent rant. But ok, here we go. 

1). Technology to track every firearm, you mean like a national registry? Because that would be against the law thanks to the Firearm Owners Protection Act which ""prohibits the federal government from creating a national gun registry by stating that the government may not consolidate or centralize records of firearms ownership or possession."" Or are you referring the something like the ""bullet ID program"" from Maryland that cost taxpayers $5M over 15 years and solved 0 cases. 

Also, throwing an air tag on someone's car without their knowledge is illegal and is considered stalking. So not sure what your angle was here. I hope you aren't doing that. 

2) Unlawful possession of a firearm is already a 10 year sentence and is usually attached to other charges. But you can write all the laws you want, it doesn't work if the DA doesn't prosecute people. Right now, the DC DA only prosecutes 2/3rds of people that commit UPF. 

3) Too many dudes with mullets concerned about their freedoms - I don't know any lawful gun owner that wants to keep firearms in the hands of the criminal. However, every time gun control advocates push for gun control, they take the ability to purchase and carry a firearm for self and home protection out of law abiding Jane and John Doe. Case in point Carol Bowne who was murdered by her ex because New Jersey didn't want to give her her right to protect herself  ['No one helped her': NJ woman murdered by ex while awaiting gun permit | Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/us/no-one-helped-her-nj-woman-murdered-by-ex-while-awaiting-gun-permit). Every gun control law in the book does nothing but hinder law-abiding citizens. Never has a Gun Free Zone sign, an assault weapons ban, or magazine capacity ban done anything to save a life. But I am curious, what would be some measure you could implement that would not inadvertently cause innocents to die or be subject to other crimes? And before you throw out the Australia Assault Weapons ban, I suggest you do some research before I make you look stupid.",5,2024,3,1,1,5

It's crucial to clarify that this has nothing to do with ""Black DC natives"". The majority of us are hardworking and law abiding, to suggest otherwise is sadly mistaken and offensive. The issue is criminals and the corrupt and stupid politicians who empower them.

Last year, my 80-year-old Black mother was carjacked at gunpoint in front of her home that she's lived at for 40 years. Both my mother and I hold Ivy League degrees. I mention this not to boast but to counter any implication that ""black DC natives"" are are ignorant, lazy, criminal thugs, we are suffering in this crime wave like everyone else

It's important to recognize that D.C. has always grappled with a lawless element. What distinguishes the current situation is the emergence of politicians and elected officials who advocate for and shelter criminals. Worth noting is that this issue affects Black middle-class and working-class individuals just as it does everyone else. We need solutions but vilainizing black DC natives is wrong and won't help.",194,2024,1,1,1,4
kj1nuin,19cjyej,bnralt,"Just my personal opinion. For a background, I’m a D.C. native, went to DCPS, going back a few generations. Lots of family and friends in the city itself and the surrounding area.

First of all I want to say that you’re going to get a very skewed idea of D.C. locals from the other two subs, both of which are mostly non-D.C. natives. The big one seems to be mostly people with somewhat sheltered upbringings in white suburbs and seem to have this idea that they’re “slumming” living here. Back when gentrification was really taking off, it was usually longtime locals who would warn people they say walking around a neighborhood about crime, and these types of transplants that would laugh and dismiss those concerns (I’m not sure how much that’s changed, though).

They’re the kind of people who always say, “Oh, you mean your from the city itself? That’s pretty rare here.” I usually respond, “That depends on who you hang out with,” because a lot of them do seem to hang out with other successful transplants.

That’s fine, no hate. The problem is a good portion of them seem to not have had a lot of interactions with black people in the past, then hang out in groups that don’t have a lot of black people. They don’t take much notice of the numerous hard working black people in the city, see the few who commit crimes, and think to themselves “Well, I guess black people commit crimes, in order to be nice to black people I should be nice to criminals.” It’s a really weird mindset, and the people pushing this are (I have to assume inadvertently) pushing a very negative portrayal of locals.

Now I’m talking about how these transplants have a weird view of black residents, but it’s important to point out that D.C. natives with black residents of D.C.  aren’t the same thing. The city was only majority black for a little over a generation, and even during that time about 1/3 of its residents weren’t black. A lot of people who come here don’t have a good sense of how this city (and the surroundings) have changed historically, adding to their skewed view of things. There’s also been a lot of movement from the city to the suburbs and vice versa over the decades (across all demographics). Which is actually a good segue into the other D.C sub.

A lot of people here seem to think the other D.C. sub is indicative of “D.C. culture” and its failures. But if you’ve looked around there, it’s pretty clear that almost all the people there are folks living in the suburbs who seem to think they inherited D.C. residency. This probably sounds strange if you haven’t come across it, but it’s something that’s not uncommon in this area. Someone who was born and raised in the suburbs will claim to be from D.C. because their mother grew up in the city before moving to the suburbs at 13.

My experience growing up here seems to mostly match what I read about when people talk about coming from a somewhat mediocre hometown. I don’t really love the place, I don’t really hate it. I run into people from school from time to time, and they’re all nice. Most seem to be getting along fine, but few seem to be really thriving. Many have moved to the suburbs.

I’m not going to say that there aren’t idiot locals who do stupid things, because of course there are. But when people try to paint that as being representative of locals, it’s often coming from an ignorant and cartoonish view of the city. Imagine if the worst people in your hometown were giving freedom to make life miserable for everyone around them, because some transplants moved in and had such a negative view of your town that they thought those idiots represented everyone there.",14,2024,1,1,1,6

kj2xzwb,19cjyej,4ucklehead,"You're right about everything you are saying

Something that progressives are not focused on at all is that one thing government does is create incentives... progressives right now are incentivizing all the things we don't want in society like criminality, laziness, antisocial behavior of many kinds... and they are disincentivizing the behaviors we do want in the society like starting businesses and having a career.

Eventually the ordinary working person who is not a priority at all is gonna get pissed enough to demand change. The ordinary avg working person should be the priority, not last in the list. Similarly, it's important to look out for the interests of business owners... they create jobs, generate taxes, and make the city a nice place to visit & live. Driving businesses out is just dumb.

DC, like many progressive cities, is on the fast track to being a city full of net tax consumers and declining tax revenue as all the net tax payers and businesses flee.

Also, this may seem unrelated to the native v transplant debate, but it's not. The reason is bc progressives have adopted a mentality that certain groups should get special treatment no matter how badly they behave... this is a form of privilege. This is very similar to the idea that natives should come first before transplants.

kj2z3bk,19cjyej,4ucklehead,"This is reminding me of one of the silliest things I've seen on this subreddit... the topic of discussion was why do many young BIPOC were engaging in crime.

Someone said it's poverty and someone else pointed out that many of these kids aren't from super impoverished backgrounds and then someone swooped in to explain that the reason young black men are engaging in crime in such large numbers in DC was bc they don't have access to the ""halls of power and prestige""... direct quote

So a few things about that... while these kids are cutting school and robbing people, other BIPOC kids from their same neighborhood are in school and on track for college...*those* are the kids who will and *should* have access to the ""halls of power and prestige"". In fact there has never been a better time to be a BIPOC who aspires to be president or lead a company or what have you. Many companies are very actively seeking these BIPOC out.

The key to understand is that kids who have decided to cut school and commit crimes don't deserve to have access to the halls of power and prestige... if they decide to turn things around and lead a good life, then yes they shouldn't be held back by their past. But society should reward people who choose to work hard and do prosocial things like getting a high school diploma and getting a job, not antisocial things.

Regardless of race, it’s *repeat offenders*, of whom are an incredibly small percentage, that are committing the majority of crime.

	NYC found nearly a third of all shoplifting arrests in the city in 2022 involved just 327 people, who collectively were arrested and rearrested more than 6,000 times. 

	In another study researchers found that 1% of people were accountable for 63% of all violent crime convictions, and 0.12% of people accounted for 20% of violent crime convictions. (Falk 2014)

	DC focused info: 
	A different analysis by the National Institute for Criminal Justice Reform finds that for the crime of homicide: “Overall, most victims and suspects with prior criminal offenses had been arrested about 11 times for about 13 different offenses by the time of the homicide. This count only refers to adult arrests and juvenile arrests were not included.” 

	Again, we see that homicide offenders typically have been arrested numerous times before they commit their first homicide. They also note that some 500 identifiable people account for 60-70% of all gun violence in the District of Columbia.",25,2024,1,1,1,4

You have to understand the history of DC and why it was once called Chocolate City. 

During the crack epidemic people migrated out of the city because crime was rampant. Many blacks stayed because they couldn’t afford to leave. When things in the city improved people began to move back…. Increasing the housing market. Thanks to red lining it only allowed blacks to live in certain neighborhoods until 40 years ago when the Fair housing bill was passed. This affected how much money went to schools and how neighborhoods were policed amongst many other things. The more people moved back to the city the more people began to move into black neighborhoods with higher poverty levels. 

The poverty and the crime in the city is the effect of Red lining, mass incarceration, racism, and the government flooding the streets with drugs to fund a war. So, to blame a group of people who have always put at a disadvantage is irresponsible.",0,2024,1,1,1,4

kka9712,1aerk5y,visualcharm,"I'm new to DC and followed the sub due to the censorship of crime discussions on the main sub, so I really appreciate threads like this. In my opinion, DC is the first city to treat crime as if it were a drug problem -- with acceptability and leniency for reform, rather than enforcement. I don't know how the thought process came about because addiction and intentional crime are two different things, even if they have a lot of overlap. Even then, policymakers should have seen how open drug markets like Skid Row have terribly negative consequences to society and not applied that logic to something even more consequentially dangerous. I wouldn't be surprised if non-native criminals hear of how lenient DC is and come here to run operations, just as how drug addicts that do not want to get better flock to open drug market neighborhoods.

The longer they let this continue, the worse long-term impact will be on not just DC residents, but the country. I mean this as, the criminal activity clearly has greater backing. Cars aren't being parted out to put a meal on the table, that money is being funneled into gang activity that exceeds this geographical location. It also puts more illegal guns into circulation. On an implicit level, I was surprised to meet a medical professional who was driving without a license - they shrugged and thought it was acceptable. The leniency corrupts greater society in even this sort of way. 

I think people refuse to speak about it because the level of criminal activity here is a matter of life and death. When faced with it, the individual is helpless. Even with self-defense tools, how am I, a 95 lb woman, going to stand up to this issue? The best course of action is to lay low and hope things pass. I find myself doing that when I walk outside; I walk quickly in fear, with my jaws clenched, and hope my fear doesn't show. There is also the lingering thought that if criminals overrule the city, local law enforcement will soon lose their ability to control the situation. As in, even if law enforcement is granted more rights to exercise authority, there will be major violent protest from criminals who were allowed leniency this entire time. 

I disagree with the racial profiling that I see. I think following that line of thinking is incorrect. Instead, we need to be proactive about bringing the attention on the short and long-term consequences of a mercy-approach to morally wrong behavior to leaders and the public (like news media outlets). I remembered my trips to DC from when I was younger and had 0 inkling of the criminal growth here before I came. The more people keep to a bubble and rant about the wrong thing, the greater the allowance of how things are becomes.

There are many roots to this.  The Constitution.  Racism.  Congress.  Poverty.  Those issues have been discussed for years.

When I moved to DC, there was a Control Board that managed the city’s finances.  The prison was subject to federal court oversight.  The school system was also subject to court oversight.  Other city entities were subject to oversight.  The DMV (a shared experience for most city dwellers) was punishing for residents.  It was a true disaster.  Wealthier residents had fled en masse.  

I remember that the school system couldn’t figure out what people “did” in the school system.  They were just paying people.  The solution was to have everyone pick up their checks in-person and then describe their job on a piece of fucking paper.

Into the 00’s, the city’s finances improved, the Control Board was lifted thanks to the hard work of a team of dedicated civil servants.  The prison was closed.  Developers started building in ever new neighborhoods.  If you ever had the deal with the city, however, you knew that things had not changed.  The pits of bureaucratic incompetency and nonsense remained.  

In the mean time, all these white folks moved into the city and couldn’t figure out why they couldn’t get a new trashcan.  Now they are surprised to learn where they all moved.

So here we are.  Insane truancy rates.  A defunded and neutered police force with a basic unwillingness to enforce the law.  A police lab that has been de-certified for years (how do you process evidence without a lab)?  A US Attorney’s office focused on J6 and unwilling to deal with the bs that is the MPD.  A city council with white “progressives” (people who would do Neville Chamberlain proud), a guy who thinks that the Rothschild control the weather, and a lackluster mayor - who is way over her head.  Add some poverty and the corrupt influence of social media on the young and old - and you have got the current situation.  

It is not going to be fixed.  There may be some patches and tweaks.  The underlying issues remain.  Everyone deserves to be safe. 

In the mean time, downtown is going to die.  The teams will leave.  The workers will never return in these circumstances.  And if the Republicans get full control of the government ever again, they will spread the agencies and their workers across the region and country.  

My advice.  Move now.  While you can.",6,2024,1,1,1,3

While in for repair, someone tried to break into that same minivan, scratching up all of the door handles.  3. Someone vandalized my car. 4. My son was almost abducted by a car thief.  5. My son had to jump out of the way of another car thief in front of his elementary school (edit: Actually this one happened a few years after the others).  6. My son was attacked by a bully in his PRE-SCHOOL who said he wanted him to die because he's white.  7. I was accosted by 3 teenagers and called ""an ugly white guy"" right before they threw a rock at my head.  8. My wife drove through a gang shoot-out without realizing it (she's profoundly deaf). 9.

kkbmyae,1aerk5y,kgst,">I’m quite liberal. I hate when suburbanites and/or conservatives fearmonger about how “dangerous” cities are - calm down, when a lot of people live together, crime is statistically inevitable. Whether it’s on Fox News or seemingly every big city subreddit, the fearmongering is annoying and usually wrong. I’m sure many residents of DC share my general inclinations on this type of thing.

The author's original post demonstrates exactly why and how we've landed in the situation we are in.

Crime is not statistically inevitable as a result of large groups of people living together. Some cities have drastically higher or lower crime rates than others. Compare Tokyo to Washington DC, or Austin, TX to Detroit or any city to any other city and you'll see 2x to 100x differences in murder, crime, etc. Minimizing crime and violence as ""inevitable"" results in making no effort to actually improve the situation.

Until liberals start holding each other accountable to reality and that it's not ok to just lie constantly to push a narrative, things will continue to get worse. Wanting laws and punishments is not racist. Talking about crime is not racist or ""soft"" or ""hardcore conservative"", it's something we should all care about and try to fix. Also not passing or enforcing certain laws in the name of ""equity"" is batshit crazy.

Next time you're in a conversation and someone says ""Crime is inevitable, only conservatives have a problem with crime in major cities"", respond with ""crime is something we should all work towards reducing, regardless of where you are on the political spectrum"".",33,2024,1,1,1,6

Widespread carry seems much more likely to incentive immediate execution of drivers by carjackers than dissuading them. Gang members haven’t stopped shooting each other despite knowing the other side can shoot back.

Yes, things need to change, and yes, a lot of people who prioritize social inequity need to re-evaluate what they think are productive ways to respond to the resulting criminal behavior. 

We have to take steps to respond to the crime that is happening now. All these reports say that the people who are committing these crimes are overwhelmingly known to police as repeat offenders. They need to be locked up. And we need to stop feeling badly about doing so. 

We also need to take a deep, long look at the intervention programs they have been in place for the last 10 years. Clearly they aren’t working. The youth of today are committing far more violent crime than the youth of 10 years ago. Is that execution? Is it substance? We need to figure out.

There’s a lot you say that I agree with, though I think you’ve left one important thing out and I hope your advice to move is wrong, because I want to see the city bounce back. 

So here’s what we need to consider: this is an epidemic of YOUTH violence. People don’t realize how negatively the pandemic impacted kids’ social and emotional development. I have a friend who for years has run a somewhat ritzy summer program for kids, and she says even those privileged kids are out of control. As an organization, they have acknowledged they have to treat 14-year-olds as if they are 11! 

Another thing I notice is people debate the value of social programs vs jail time. No! We need both! And frankly, the best medical care (including psych care) is found in the prison system. Have you ever talked to the ex cons who work with troubled kids? There are many non-profits in the city who put these ex cons in front of kids to both “scare them straight” and to teach them solid skills.

I am a 20 year military vet still serving in the DMV or as we refer to it the MDW (Military District of Washington). The DC does not allow me to conceal carry in any manner within the district.  While I am a military police officer and am eligible for my LEOSA carry permit, I have not completed all the requirements; nor do I feel really comfortable with the reality that I may need to use a firearm against my own countrymen.  

In my military history, I have been perfectly comfortable with going on combat patrol where I or one of my soldiers may pay the ultimate price for our efforts.  However, I monitor these channels and I don’t not feel comfortable proceeding into the district unarmed when my family is at stake.  There are some areas of DC we will simply NOT go.  This level of lawlessness cannot go unanswered. I have been reading about teenagers robbing people of their coats and jackets with assault rifles in DC and I am supposed to feel comfortable bringing my eight year old daughter into the city?

kjsr7v5,1abwq88,Particular_Drama7110,I grew up in the DC area in the 1980's.  DC has always had high crime.  DC used to compete with Detroit every year as the murder capital of the country.  Complaining about car break ins is not going to be considered that big of a deal.  The idea that crime is on the rise is not correct.  Violent crime has been going down nationwide.  Crime is a very complex issue and one of the main drivers of criminal behavior is income inequality and a lack of opportunity.

Yes, that “feeling” has definitely continued to escalate since you left, but there is *also* a selection bias component to it.

I lived really close to Rock Creek Park which was super helpful. But after COVID something just fundamentally felt different. You mentioned the word lawlessness and that's how I would describe it too.  

When I first moved to the city I was in Columbia Heights a lot and then I'm not sure what exactly happened but it just seemed like it wasn't night time that stuff was happening there anymore.  I used to take the bus there and I didn't really feel safe waiting for it anymore.  U St. which was always crazy felt different crazy.

At least one ranking site puts Baltimore above DC in terms of safety. Both are near the bottom of the list. 

I think it is still very block to block in terms of targeted violence that might spill over (drug markets and drive bys) and you can significantly impact your susceptibility to carjackings, assaults and robberies by not driving a desirable vehicle, being careful where/when you fill up gas, avoiding high school arrival and dismissal time on the metro and bus (mostly just teens are unruly with a chance of witnessing or being a victim of random assault) and not being out near clubs and bars after midnight. 

I worry for my family often but theres things that minimize our risks. My partner works in Adams Morgan but during daytime its fine, neither of us drive cars that get stolen often to ever, I use a cheapo ugly bike to get around, my kids go to school in a very low crime area in a DCPS school with minimal to no major safety events and I reverse commute to work. Where we live in Petworth, is least safe out of everything we can control, but we are working on finding a more peaceful/safer block/neighborhood soon. In the meantime we are proactive when crimes start to tick up on our block and work with police whenever we witness anything serious or can be helpful to an investigation",2,2023,10,1,1,5

I’m on this sub myself because the other DC sub won’t let discussion of crime occur. So I’m part of the skew. But know that most of the answers you’ll get are from people here for the same reason. 

Although I’ve lived in DC since 2014, I have been out of the country for a number of months and just seeing news and discussion threads has me worried about going back. But then I have to remember when I was living there just 6 months ago I didn’t feel ‘the danger’ despite living in the H St NE area. I don’t drive tho - I think I’d feel the carjacking risk. 

That said, I have always taken precautions - i.e. don’t have all of my money / phone / cards in the same pocket in case I get mugged and hope I can get away with just handing them some of it, avoid walking close to groups of people just hanging around, immediately lock my door behind me as soon as getting inside, had a mental plan in my head of what I’d do if threatened/attacked, etc. So maybe if I hadn’t always done that sort of thing I’d feel the need to start now. 

We rent our house out while we’re out of town, and all of our guests have reported feeling safe in the neighborhood. Because they’re just seeing with their eyes rather than following crime stats.

I've lived here since early 90s, with kids, including in some of the places you mention, OP. It is really different now. And the crime is much more random and often involves people jumping out of stolen cars to rob or carjack at gunpoint, hard to avoid that when out and about, kwim?  

With a baby/child, there is buckling them into car seats, getting them out of the car, being slowed walking by pushing a stroller, etc., makes you more vulnerable to crime. What is the upside in risking it? There is increased violent crime on WMATA, including during peak fares, at stations like Metro Center, Gallery Place, LF.

k5ks8q4,17bcxz5,AnonyJustAName,"Have you had multiple kids in multiple DC schools over time yourself? The quality has changed in recent years even at what you term ""exceptional schools"" in DC. It's truly unfortunate.

With kids, often ""start as you mean to go on"" is useful. For OP, not struggling with possibly being underwater in mortgage, etc., family can easily get established in burbs, meet other parents with babies, build relationships with neighbors and can settle in one area with less concerns re: safety of family.

As someone whose family planned to stick it out in DC and DCPS, beginning in another era, now is not that time. OP will likely end up moving anyway, the trends are not reversing. It's disruptive to relationships and those are good to build as a family. In burbs almost all kids go to neighborhood school, can play outside, it's a very different life and in many ways a lot less stressful, not just because of crime. In DC there are less families on the block and the kids may all go to different schools. If kids go to a charter school may pull from all over the city and involve a lot of driving to playdates, bday parties, etc. There is less community. In burbs the communities for families are around the neighborhood school almost completely.

Should your kid be advanced or have learning issues or some sn, those will likely be better addressed in burbs, it's just the reality, and that is based on personal experience with ""exceptional"" upper NW DCPS over time. People sometimes end up scrambling. There is a also the fact that VA and MD offer high quality in state more affordable options for higher education which DC lacks.

DC Crime Facts documented that USAO increased prosecution rates after being summoned to the Hill for some ""oversight"" in May, so in June, his office only declined to prosecute 55% of arrests, down from a high of 67% of cases being ""no papered."" By July, that no paper rate had increased again.

If OP can buy a SFH, he should work with a realtor and raise these issues re: DMV region. I already raised genuine safety issues renting in bounds for the upper NW schools close to Connecticut and Wisconsin corridors and that applies to rented apartments and rented condos. Look at the MPD crime cards for various buildings, the changes over time are startling.

The realities are what they are, that route to what you call ""exceptional"" schools has a lot of safety risks that never existed before. Buildings in Forest Hills, Cleveland Park, Cathedral Heights and Chevy Chase DC were not being reported by MPD as ""nuisance properties"" even a few years ago. Living in a building with sex offenders and murderers is not what most desire for family living. So that leaves the route to the better schools as SFH w/fewer exceptions. And as families leave DC or higher achieving kids leave DCPS, it's having an impact.

It's all super unfortunate. But trends show no signs of reversing. If we had foreseen any of this, we would have made different choices. OP can't afford to be naive or overly idealistic, it is what it is. I'm sure better days will come for again for both the city and DCPS, but I would not count on it being too soon. DC used to be CHEAP when crime was high, now it is the worst of all worlds with high COL, high rent and high and random crime, including in the daytime and in areas formerly considered safe. After the shooting at Brandywine at 3pm on a Saturday recently, the shooters ran across Forest Hills Playground.

Families are moving out of Petworth, would not recommend to OP with a baby. There is a lot of violence right near that metro and a guy was stabbed to death in the Petworth library at the computers next to little kids.

No papering 2/3 of adult arrests and AGs who think restorative justice is appropriate for homicides committed by juveniles has really emboldened violence. Day/witnesses/cameras don't matter anymore because the chance of serious consequences for the criminal are so low.

As someone who lived in some of the same places as OP, with young kids, I would not live there today. Lanier Heights used to be full of young kids, now people are moving/have moved. After the 3pm Saturday shooting in Forest Hills, I know renters there who have kids who are moving. In that area, over 3,000 PSH vouchers means you may be paying thousands in rent but your taxes may literally move in a released murderer or sex offender next door. DC has no restrictions re: CSA offenders living near kids or schools, Murch has a lot of apartment buildings nearby, you may be shocked at how many SO there are. 

SO are listed on a registry, no way to know about returning citizens who were convicted of very violent offenses. DC only allows landlords a 7 year look back for any crime, regardless of how rent is paid, so if someone did 8 years for homicide or rape or SA of minor, can't be considered, there are no carve outs by offense. Buildings used to require income and credit checks for all, but with voucher not subject to credit checks, etc. So a lot of what DC calls ""returning citizens"" are moving in and in some buildings they become the majority of residents, defacto overpriced ""private public housing."" Not a great environment for a baby if you have other options. 

So, OP, be very wary renting in the Connecticut or Wisconsin corridors which used to be a way for middle class families to access good schools w/o buying houses. Even Frumin has had to admit that crime has greatly increased, including carjackings in the neighborhood by kids living in apartment buildings. The PSA from Cleveland Park up through FH has had the greatest % increase in crime of anywhere in the city in recent years based on MPD crime cards and written about in WP. Google ""nuisance properties Forest Hills"" or ""Washington Post Sedgewick Gardens"" and think about if that is the environment you want to provide for your child, OP.

So some areas do fit your crime is new scenario, PP, others, crime existed but has increased significantly, esp during hours OP and his wife are likely to be out and about, with the baby. It's sad to see so much backsliding re: crime and schools.

k5lbwok,17bcxz5,AnonyJustAName,"So glad you had that experience for your kiddo, I know several who have not. Sometimes it's good, then, as you said, with personnel changes, it worsens. MC and Fairfax have some very good programs based on what child needs.  I know people who have tried to get DC to pay for Lab since school is not compliant with IEP, typically without success. They rue spending money on lawyers and the lost time and wish they had just moved sooner. So sad that that is often the answer. So painful to witness the gains slip away, eh?

I have only had experience with schools in upper NW, friends have been happy in charters or in elementary schools on the Hill, or at Basis. I don't have direct experience with those but do know it gets harder re; cohort, behavior issues and grade level learning in many schools after elementary esp if child is advanced or needs different help.

We are still here too, trying to hang on for a few more years until youngest out of school with cohort he grew up with. It has shrunk in recent years as kids have gone private or families have moved, people that had always planned to hang in for Deal/Wilson/JR.

I know people in rentals who don't have the ability to move, some who don't have cars and who feel very stuck in worsening situations that used to be fairly ideal for families of modest means, divorced moms, etc. to get kids into Oyster, Janney, Lafayette, Murch, etc. to thread that needle to Deal/JR or Deal/SWW.

In a lot of ways it feels like the compact families had with DCPS has been changed, but that it is true with DC overall. The Fenty years really were a great time to be in the city with young kids, even EoTP, had so many positive trends and a great vibe.  It continued for a while but the trends are really different now. We need to be in DMV for work reasons, I envy you your options.

Re: my older kids, it worked out mostly as we had expected, but if I was just starting a family today, given last few years, and current patterns, I would make other choices, and I say that with kids who are lifers. Crime is a genuine factor. Re: schools you can offer enrichment, get tutors, etc., for safety, we are largely reliant on a very weak CJ system. It increases stress in ways that friends a few miles away just don't experience. 

When I hear of people being carjacked with babies or kids in the car, or the parents who have been attacked on the Hill (that poor baby bashed in the face with a brick as the dad begged) it is so upsetting, and I am grateful my kids are not so little and vulnerable. The putting them in and out of car seats presents and opportunity as does being slowed by stroller. A friend on the Hill has had a hard time keeping a nanny due to violent crime very nearby during the day. When the safety of kids is on the line it is best to be really clear eyed about choices.

k5l0ilk,17bcxz5,AnonyJustAName,"A lot of your former neighbors have moved from Petworth to WoTP and gotten unhappy surprises if they rent. Some buildings are majority mentally ill, addicted or formerly incarcerated and the number of sex offenders, including against kids, in rental buildings WoTP has really increased in past few years. Just be fully aware of factors where you land, walk around in daytime and at night, weekdays and weekends. Condo buildings have had a lot of issues with disruptive voucher tenants too. Even if ok if you move in, you have little to no control over possible future renters, so have a plan B in your back pocket.

I helped a friend move out of Petworth from right by the metro. Her neighbor had door kicked in. Hope you find someplace safer soon. I remember when all those little stores were opening up, it's a shame how much things have backslid.

Say your kid goes to Murch and makes a friend, say in 4th or 5th. Say the friend lives at The Brandywine or The Saratoga, both buildings where the recent daytime shooter had ""associations"" per Frumin and MPD. LE is frequently at both buildings, day and night, and there is sometimes visible dealing nearby, MPD reported both as ""nuisance buildings"" meaning they had very frequent calls there, they perceived security issues that were not addressed, etc. What do you say when your kid wants to go over for a playdate or sleepover? Do you let them walk over alone after school? At that age, if safety/crime was not an issue, would be fine. Do you let them carry a phone with them that they could be mugged for? Forget 20 years ago, 10 years ago would have been FINE. Now, lots more to weigh up than in most burb schools. 

Lots more violent crime on metro during peak fare hours, bus and trains. It's changed the ages people let kids free roam in many families. I recently saw someone smoking crack in a redline train during rush hour. People are often having mental health episodes. My older kids had more freedom, they did not have to navigate this kind of thing even 6 years ago.

 ""Yes, rape is never ok. Its never ok for a man to violate a woman in that way. That said, you need to be smart. Don't dress provocatively, while galavanting around in a dangerous area, alone, at night. While its NEVER ok to blame the victim, its also on the person to engage in a little bit of situational awareness. Bad people are gonna exist, and they're gonna do what they do.

That said, my argument is this: While there isn't a shortage of cops (and therefore ""police guns"") in DC, their response time makes it such that they might as well not be around. What good is a squad of cops with guns if they show up 30 minutes after the thug has beat you up, shot your dog, stole your car, and has been gone for 20 minutes? Same idea with people that live in rural areas; if there's a home invasion, the nearest cop could be an hour away.

So in a scenario like the aforementioned ones, what is the solution to the person on the receiving end of crime? They can be a victim, at the mercy of whatever the thug wants to do, or they can give themselves some agency, and the option to fight back. I prefer to fight back than to be a victim.

If they have a stable life where they attend school / work they're probably not the ones in the worst spot.
Also, we can fix this issue somewhat by building very high density housing to drive down housing costs. Even the affordable housing costs more than what housing cost a decade ago in poorer areas, a lot more.
Also you're not allowed to discriminate except by a few things like age, so places that do this generally just limit affordable housing to the elderly.

We should improve housing affordability not by broken and corrupt affordable housing policies, but by lessening building restrictions and perhaps outright funding high density low cost housing.

We should make the penalties for recruiting or encouraging children to commit crimes incredibly severe and prosecute the TikTok influencers encouraging them under RICO crimes, as well as local gangs.

We should empower police to pursue investigations and crimes even if flawed. We can mandate body camera for all of them.

The DOJ had like 3 opportunities before the mass shooting to knock this guy out for like idk a thousand bucks? (Whatever the cost of a few lawyers is) They still failed.

And ""Loose patchwork of state and local laws?""

Every state has involuntary commitment. Like it's very much an established procedure in America since the 70s. Just like the process of obtaining an arrest or search warrant. Just because civil commitment is badly enforced due to negligent reporting does not mean gun owners are to blame because you hate guns and you think everything is the gun owners fault. 

As for the gun laws in Chicago and Indiana, those things have nothing to do with what happened here. ROFL. You're trying to turn this into a winning argument for the antigunners and it isn't working. The shit happening in chicago is a mix of poverty, soft on crime laws, and culture. A bunch of gangsters are bringing guns into chicago from indiana. OK so wtf is Indiana supposed to do. Are they gang banging in Indiana or chicago? Obviously chicago. So how about better surveillance and prosecutions of gangsters in chicago? The cops don't know where the gangsters are or something? Hint: they do but they defended the police SMH. Even if Indiana could intercept the gangsters while they're in the middle of purchasing guns, do you honestly think that's the best way to go about it? Dude. Take a look at Singapore. Surrounded by drug infested regions. They give the drug dealers the death penalty and nobody dares bring drugs to singapore. Maybe they're onto something? It has nothing to do with guns. If chicago and Indiana were basically the same exact thing and the only thing different about them is that chicago were more antigun and has a huge crime problem, that would validate the pro gun arguments even more LMFAO. And if youre suggesting that Indiana adopt more anti gun laws to make Chicago's surrounding area more hostile to guns, that is begging the question to the max. You're forcing me to choose between 1) Being soft on crime and anti gun or 2) Being soft on crime and pro gun. You then get angry when I say no to option 1. You pretend i support option 2 when I actually think both choices absolutely suck ass. I'm saying you need to choose between 1) Being tough on crime and pro gun, 2) Being soft on crime and pro gun, 3) Being tough on crime and anti gun, or 4) Being soft on crime and anti gun. We should choose option 1 everywhere and you think we should choose option 4 everywhere.

What Indiana is supposed to do is require background checks every time someone buys or transfers a gun, eliminating the loophole for private sales, and to raise a red flag if the same guy keeps showing up every two weeks to buy a dozen 9mms.  But there's no mandatory universal background checks and there's no searchable database of gun transactions that can help identify straw buyers.  What all jurisdictions need to also do is to have mental health screenings.

k6zgbyf,17j7mvb,Maximus560,"The major issue here apart from what you have said is two-fold: 

1. Prosecutors: One quick solution that we can do in the short term with immediate impact is to get the prosecutors do their job. The main issue is that prosecutors are federal in DC, so local government has no sway over how they choose to prosecute cases. The federal prosecutors are focused on other things at the federal level, not local cases for the most part. If cases aren't being prosecuted, then cops have no incentive to arrest people especially for minor crimes. Minor crimes that aren't prosecuted or enforced often leads to major crimes later, since criminals aren't held accountable and know they won't be held accountable. Change the prosecutors to be accountable to local government and things will change quickly IMO. Cops and the mayor can't do shit if prosecutors are letting criminals free the same day they're arrested. 
2. Lack of Investment: One longer range or wider issue is that DC doesn't invest enough in  schools, services, homelessness, drugs, jobs, etc which are often the root causes of crime. This solution would take 5-15+ years just to see fruit so there isn't much point for politicians to do anything or care about these things, but they are very impactful. If we had better social service programs, more affordable housing, a better jobs pipeline, better schools, and better diversion programs, then we can easily cut crime down significantly. For example - most of the crime that we see at Starburst has to do with drugs. Cracking down on drugs isn't going to solve the root causes of these issues - we need to invest in housing, mental health support, rehabilitation programs, etc. These programs will take a while, and are expensive, so there's very little appetite on the part of voters and politicians to even think about tackling these issues.",11,2023,10,1,1,4

k6zks4z,17j7mvb,lawblawg,"While any solution would need to be comprehensive and multifaceted, I can point to a few contributing causes.

MPD requires a college degree for most officer applicants, something that is fairly uncommon among law enforcement agencies nationwide. While I certainly understand the purpose of this requirement and one might presume that it would raise the calibre of applicants, it seems to have done the opposite. Being an MPD officer pays reasonably well and has great benefits, but it is an awful job with a lot of unpleasant and demanding elements, and everyone is going to hate you. As a result, most of the people with college degrees who apply nowadays are the ones who can't really do anything else with their degree or don't fit in any other industry. MPD is scraping the bottom of the barrel when it comes to applicants, and it's just getting worse and worse. Paradoxically, we would end up with BETTER applicants (and thus better officers) if we got rid of the college degree requirement, because we'd end up getting the best of the non-degree-holders applying instead of the worst of the degree-holders.

Speaking of MPD, their job is basically impossible. DC is a uniquely complex city and MPD is tasked with doing way too much. On top of the usual social-work-level nonsense that cities often assign to cops (usually leading to more violent escalations of otherwise-nonviolent situations), MPD also has a lot of duties related to the federal enclave and has to assist all of the other various law enforcement agencies but is always subordinated to their authority. Most cities have a separate sheriff department to handle things like service of process, but here it's all on MPD. Since there's no way to do the whole job, they do it more and more poorly. There needs to be a way to narrow MPD's duties as far as possible so that the officers who actually care have an actual chance of succeeding. MPD should have fewer responsibilities related to the federal government and fewer responsibilities related to non-crime-fighting activities. We don't need uniformed officers going around taking non-time-critical reports. I remember earlier this summer that my girlfriend got hit in the head by a random individual who was going door to door in Brookland stores throwing objects at people, and we reported it, and officers showed up that night to take the report and write down what we said in a little notebook and refer it to a detective. Convenient for us, sure -- but it's not like they were going to catch the person right then, so why isn't there a less time-consuming way to take crime reports?

Guns are a big part of the problem as well. Based on what I've been able to determine from crime statistics, there is a pretty large contingent of people in DC who are illegally carrying guns not because they intend to commit crime, but because they feel unsafe and feel a need to protect themselves. Those unregistered, untraceable guns are subsequently very likely to end up in the hands of criminals. We should make it possible for individuals without criminal records to [lawfully register firearms they already possess](https://www.reddit.com/r/DCGuns/comments/17cr76w/registration_amnesty_proposal/) so that they can actually be held accountable moving forward.

The other stuff is big, system-wide changes. We can keep petitioning for statehood, though I doubt we'll ever get it. We could do a public referendum to try and require different prosecutorial practices. We could make it clear that we want an attorney general who will handle juvenile crime differently, and show up in primaries.

I think this is very doable but i don't see people talking about it the right way. We need to be SCIENTIFIC and accountable. Enforcement is critical but up river prevention even more so.

Would love your thoughts:

Deputy Mayor for Public Safety +
Criminal Justice Coordinating Council

Let's get serious about solving these issues

Thank you for hosting this meeting.

My name is James Salt and I’m a resident of Ward 4. A man was murdered in front of my children and me this past March at the Petworth library.

This traumatic event motivates me to invest energy in pursuing community safety.

Here are my thoughts. I’d particularly like a response from Ms. Appiah and then anyone else.

Crime needs an immediate response for the sake of accountability. Given this dynamic though, we tend to be more reactive and less proactive.

In other words, 75% of what we discuss should be up-river solutions - particularly if we are serious about wanting different outcomes.

The 25% is also essential and needs to be addressed, but we shouldn’t allow the acute issues to limit our vision of the larger, more systemic forces producing the problem.

That said, here are my thoughts inspired by a friend and fellow Petworth resident Tara McGuiness (https://www.newamerica.org/our-people/tara-mcguinness/)

We should be applying the scientific method in solving these problems.

We need committed leaders willing to take ownership of the issue and invest personal accountability. They must be willing to own failure. Failure is critical to improving.

Pilot solutions. Don’t approach the problem with an assumption of confidence that your solution will work. Demonstrate it and test it. Avoid confirmation bias and be open to changing strategies.  

Be careful with large solutions that are difficult to modify. Typically these solutions require political capital to start and are therefore difficult to change.  

Be careful with 101 solutions. How are you testing the unique contribution of each treatment?
 
Data feedback loop. As part of accountability, you need honest data if you are truly tracking the effectiveness of a proposed solution 

Good data —-> test treatment  —-> review data changes —-> repeat. But you need to be dialed into whether you are actually moving the needle or not.

As a starting point, I’d begin with a retrospective study of crime data. Who are victims and perpetrators of crime, where do they live? Where did they go to school? What were the perpetrators’ motives for the crime? (Policy Recommendation: As part of the terms of incarceration, incentivize perpetrators participation with a retrospective crime reduction study using increased privileges or increased points towards good behavior.)  It’s also helpful to allow time to pass before collecting this information from victims, victims family and perpetrators. 

What government or community relationships existed that could have been vectors for engagement in their lives? Given the general attributes of these victims and perpetrators, what ‘continuum of care’ or ‘matrix of services’ can we prospectively deploy to interact with the affected demographic?  How could a consortium of partnered agencies and community interests: DCPS, DPR, MPD, Department of Health, DC Witness, faith communities etc. collaborate in touching the lives that need to be touched?

Moving forward: I haven’t heard DC leaders talking like this and I’m wondering if the Mayor's office-and others- are having this conversation. Are these conversations happening and who’s responsible for leading and reporting out on it? If not, is there interest getting it started right now?

Is the Criminal Justice Coordinating Council effective? Shouldn’t it be doing this?  Can its scope extend beyond the silo of criminal safety and expand into more holistic treatments that already exist?",6,2024,1,1,1,3
kjvbl2k,1ac1l8o,qcassidyy,"Move to another neighborhood. It sounds like these safety concerns are dominating your life. There are neighborhoods in DC — and yes, ones outside Georgetown and other highly sanitized/rich zip codes — that are calmer. I’ve lived in several middle class DC neighborhoods for 12 years and never experienced any of the things you describe, or at least nowhere near to the scale you’ve described them at. 

Another action you can take is mentoring a young person through organizations like DC Dream Center. It may just feel like a drop in the bucket, but in the end, you’re probably moving the needle in more of a positive direction than you’d be by emailing your council member every few weeks. The problems we’re dealing with, as suggested by another comment in this thread, penetrate far deeper than policy or laws. They are cultural, and they require deep relationships and positive role models to counteract. 

Ps, thanks for your service.",3,2024,1,1,1,8
kjrmuo2,1ac1l8o,CatbuttKisser,"There used to be neighborhood watches, which I was about to suggest before looking up statistics on their effectiveness. Maybe things could be more effective now with the ability to record videos of perpetrators than they were in 1984 when this study was examined: 

“When reported crime figures were examined, there was no clear evidence that crime had dropped more rapidly in participating blocks than in those that were not participating in the Neighborhood Watch program.”

Fixing broken windows--the only place it's really been applied was the New York subway.  CPTED. Center for Problem Oriented Policing. I guess Sharkey.

Then the issues are charging. Sentencing. (Ever compare sentencing between DC and Montgomery County?) Treating violent youth crimes seriously. Maybe pretrial evaluation needs to be reevaluated too. A bit more remand. Better pre trial monitoring. Use of police time. Crime suppression versus reaction. Better investigation capability. Investing in programs for ""returning citizens.""

For me - it limits access to things I used to enjoy here.

I lived in Columbia Heights when I was extremely young, but still remember it. It was dangerous as hell but abundant: restaurants and grocery stores. No shortage of things. Ward 8 is a food desert and Union Market really wasn't great but it was okay. I guess if I had to I would go back...",1,2023,12,1,1,4

kizoldv,19c8vfa,TuckerANC1B09,"Hi, I serve as an elected member of ANC 1B. Thank you in advance for offering to put this list together. Many of these meetings are still being held virtually or hybrid, so it can be relatively easy to attend.

For ANC 1B, our Commission meetings are generally held the first Thursday of each month, unless that date is a holiday. They are held via Zoom only unless otherwise noted. You can see all of our meetings and how to join them [on the ANC 1B website](https://www.anc1b.org).

Also, to see which ANC area you live in, I like [this unofficial website](https://openanc.org).

Some unsolicited advice: the more specific you can be with your concern, the more likely it is that your ANC can help get it addressed.

I've had luck connecting police with neighbors over complaints like ""I am worried about this repeated behavior in this alley"" and getting police walkthroughs in those areas. (I've done the same for getting the Department of Health out for ""I am worried about the rats in this particular area"" and getting the Department of Public Works out for ""I am worried about the trash in this particular area."")

However, when the problem is large scale, ANCs are not usually an effective avenue of dealing with the issue. ""I'm worried that a lot of people in DC have illegal guns"" is a very legitimate concern, but as a member of an ANC, there's really not much I can do about that. I don't even know how to begin approaching that problem, even though it's clearly more important than the one alleyway near me. Not to be to glib about it, but ""Do something about crime"" is not feedback that I or any other member of an ANC can act on - even though the sentiment is totally justified.

And one more bit of unsolicited advice: These meetings can be very long and very boring. Most of what is on the agenda will not be related to crime. Please be prepared to exercise patience, and keep an eye on the agenda so you'll know when the topics you care about are due up for discussion.

Also, please note that the various **Metropolitan Police Department districts usually have Citizens Advisory Councils (CACs)**. The 3rd District CAC (3DCAC) works with MPD's 3rd District, which includes U Street, Adams Morgan, Columbia Heights, and more. I've found those meetings useful for me to understand the various ways our public safety structures are breaking down. At the meetings I've been to, there are representatives from most of the various offices that deal with crime and public safety, including the USAO, the Attorney General, and various executive offices, plus the Ward Council Member's staff (or, pretty frequently, the Ward Council Member herself) and occasionally people from the Mayor's Office on Constituent Relations and Services. They all have different perspectives and getting them all in a room together makes it harder for them to pass the buck.

The 3DCAC meets on the final Thursday of each month (final Wednesday for Spanish-language meeting). You can read more about them [here](https://www.3dcac.org).",7,2024,1,1,1,5
kixltq7,19c8vfa,superdookietoiletexp,"The one purpose for which I have found them to be useful is to receive crime reports from the MPD and to request, in a public setting, targeted enforcement. You can do this elsewhere, though, such as through MPD community meetings.

I've found that CMs will defer to ANC resolutions over opinions of non-ANC community members. I'm not sure they should, but if you want your CM's attention, getting an ANC resolution is probably the most effective - albeit least efficient - mechanism.",5,2024,1,1,1,5

With your budget, you can rent a house. You will get a bigger house with a yard in Brookland. In Bloomingdale you will get a row house.

Personally I think Brookland and Bloomingdale are very safe. Brookland is more family centric, someone mentioned it is more ""suburban."" I'd agree with that. It has a homey vibe. 

Parking can be a real pain in D.C. especially, as you've described, needing parking in the late evening hours. If that is important to you, then I would say lean towards Brookland just because there's more space and less overall traffic/population in the area given a lot of the single family homes.

Do you really consider that “complaining” when it’s a pretty commonly held feeling among DC residents? I’m not the only person that feels this way.  

I said there needs to be accountability that’s somewhere between a minor slap on the wrist and serious jail time. No, long term prison sentences are not the answer and it’s empirically obvious that this strategy only increases recidivism. But short term sentences do seem to have some impact, especially among people who aren’t serious criminals. Arresting people is the start but that can’t be the only part of the solution. It has zero impact on a person to get booked and released again without time to think on their crime.

Back to my original point, which you seem intent on ignoring, I think the answer to a lot of these issues with teens is *deterrence*, aka making risky behavior and criminal activity as unattractive as possible.

iml1m65,x2b2l6,Delski28,"Hahahaha. This is fucking hilarious and it’s obvious to me that you didn’t read what u/DeliMcPickles said nor do you understand the current plague that is the USAO and OAG. 

Juveniles aren’t getting charged with crimes and they know it, if they are charged they’re let off with a slap on the wrist. It’s why you see anytime a juvenile or anyone for any matter is locked up for a carjacking or homicide they’ve been charged for a litany of felonies before hand. 

DC MPD, MCPD, PGPD and other departments release videos of any serious uses of force, but do you know what serious use of force is considered? The mean definition between the three is any use of force that results in a broken bone, fracture, unconsciousness, firearms, canine bites, strikes other than hand strikes to the head, and the list goes on. If i were to go tackle a fleeting robbery suspect, wherein the average person runs at 8mph, that means they’re slamming into the ground face first at 8mph if not faster after being hit. That simple shit could easily turn into a serious use of force from the impact and the same could be said for a million different uses of force. Even a taser, a tool designed to limit the use of force full stop can turn into a serious use of force. In Atlanta a officer was chasing a fleeing suspect for a misdemeanor offense and tasked him wherein the man fell and broke his neck thus leaving him paralyzed. A jury just awarded him $100m for a justified use of force. 

Now imagine all of that above, you have a juvenile fleeing from you from a stolen car or a robbery and you use force on them which results in a serious injury from what would be a low level use of force and the OAG declines to prosecute the juvenile? It doesn’t matter now because your name is released to the public with your address being readily accessible online, your work place, and now you’re also being sued civilly where even if it’s bullshit you’re now waiting six months for a verdict where the government will most likely settle because it’s cheaper than fighting it.

So now your information is released publicly, you have a “justified” use of force on a juvenile who wasn’t charged for a crime, the public knows you’re being sued too because that’s publicly available and they won’t care if it was settled or the reason for it, you’re guilty in their eyes for an “unjustified” use of force because the juvenile wasn’t charged and it cost the taxpayers money. 

So to tackle a juvenile fleeing from a stolen car or a robbery that at most would spend 12-24 hours in jail and already has a three page rap sheet, you risked your career, your retirement, your family’s safety and your own just for a juvenile to be charged for the fifth time in a year a felony?

It’s not fucking worth it and it’s easy to sit there and say everything you have without looking at it from an officers perspective or ever even going on a ride along.

>A good portion of the people I’ve seen who work in those low paying sectors aren’t actually “scraping by” — they’re middle/upper middle class suburban kids who are able to work in low paying jobs because their living expenses are subsidized by family.

In my experience, this usually means that they don't have college loans, or at best their rent is subsidized. But you're mistaking cause and effect. You seem to snub your nose at the idea of working for a ""greater good"" what used to be known as ""public service"". 

We live in Washington, DC. Many of the jobs here fall under that rubric, so by definition at any time there will be a large number of people working in those jobs, and they have to live somewhere. Even if someone's lifestyle is subsidized, that doesn't mean that they can suddenly afford a really nice rent. They're still making decisions based upon a limited supply of income, and many of them seek out lower rents where they can either have money for discretionary spending or can save. 

There's a general snobbishness or othering towards millennials/Zoomers that I'm sure you're aware of. The notion that ""avacado toast"" is some sort of luxury item. The idea that we're ""killing"" industries. The idea that living together in group housing or not buying cars is a generational quirk. in fact, we're the first generation[s] in decades to be making less than our parents, and generation-wide, that drives a lot of the decision-making.

You may not be aware of it, but it seems that you have internalized many of these same stereotypes and condescension. The nation is in a housing crisis and the region is one of the most expensive, and it's rife with low-paying jobs that people want to fill for one reason or another. Because people take these jobs, they then have to find savings elsewhere, hence the rise of group houses in gentrifying neighborhoods--they're willing to tolerate more dangerous areas in part because they don't have a ton of choice. Commuting itself is also expensive--$20 every day just to spend an hour and a half to two hours on the Metro adds up. I've done it myself, living in a group house and commuting in from near Bethesda, and it sucked.

In DC, look at the NEAR act, which meant I had to ask people who I pulled over how they identified themselves from a racial perspective. Or the law that the Council was pushing that limited pursuits.  It didn't ban pursuits per se, but was written in such a way, that the effect was to put all of the responsibility on that officer, so no pursuits.    


And applications plunged nationwide and departments became short staffed and forced overtime became more prevalent.  Starting in 2020, due to COVID, if you made an arrest, the suspect was leaving the station before you even completed the paperwork.  

And meanwhile now, people who hated the cops are like ""why don't they do anything"" or ""Be proactive, just don't kill people!""  Juveniles rarely face any time and the optics around confronting them are much worse. Also, many arrests in DC are warrant cases where you can't make an arrest on scene and instead have to apply for a warrant.

You see this in voting as well. The most progressive/anti-police/anti-incarceration politicians are getting elected in gentrifying areas that are popular with transplants. The progressives they elect themselves are usually transplants that came here for political activism. Right now the biggest pro-police member of the Council is probably Ward 7 Councilmember and D.C. native Vince Gray.

Even Ward 8 Councilmember Trayon White, who's often critical of police, voted against the criminal code reform because it had more lenient sentences and came out in support of SRO's when most of the Council was still against them.

You get the sense that transplants live in a sort of progressive bubble where they rarely interact with locals (hence the surprise they give you when you tell them they're a local), get told by activists types that ""real locals"" don't care about crime and that only a concern new arrivals have, and then they uncritically assume this to be true without actually talking to locals themselves (or outside of a handful of activist type locals).",68,2023,5,2,1,5

Second, there's so much fudging going on here when people extrapolate, from what it means to ""actually be unsafe"", what it means to ""feel unsafe"", how crime reporting funnels up into top level data, the specific types of crimes, the time and place, etc etc. In any case it seems to me how people perceive safety is very important and shouldn't be dismissed.

&#x200B;

We had a three different gunfire exchanges in our alley in the NE in like an 8 day span. Noone hit (that we could see), no f-ing clue where all these bullets end up -- i honestly am not sure that any of it funneled up into an aggregate crime rate. Like... did it not affect me because i wasn't directly involved? because a bullet did come through a window? kind of blows my mind how people focus on these aggregate stats. I sure did feel unsafe though, lol, it felt pretty justified in it.",3,2023,3,2,1,3

Parroting one of the oldest racist talking points is not ""thoughtful"". This ""one particular issue"" is one of the most harmful and community destroying ""issues"" in America over the last century.

Crime isn't associated with race, policing is.

**In DC:**

Police stop black people at a population proportionally adjusted rate of 4 to 1 compared to white people.

5% of stops for white people and 86% of stops for black people lead to no ticket/arrest.

Of the stops that lead to no ticket/arrest, 91% of the victims searched were black.

In majority-white neighborhoods, black people make up the overwhelming majority of non-traffic stops.

The perception that crime is associated with race is directly tied to racist police tactics and bias. It isn't ""generally true"", it is demonstratively false. Perpetuating this myth is racist and directly contributes to the issue of racist policing.

Crime isn't associated with race, it is associated with racism, socioeconomic factors, and biased policing.

It *is* generally true that black people are disproportionately accused of crimes and are vastly disproportionately not likely to have committed those crimes.

Case and point there was once a large building on 14th st that housed the homeless, this was redeveloped into luxury housing rather than remaining somewhere for people without adequate resources to go. This is a real shame when the people that now inhabit that building have any number of places pretty much anywhere that they could live in without it being a problem at all.  Again this is all such a shame indeed.

elo4kv2,bgv0dw,patb2015,"Unless a police officer sees a crime, they need a sworn statement that a crime occcurred.

They also need a complaining victim.

Consider domestic violence cases. The neighbors hear the screaming, the things getting thrown around,

the cops come.  If the spouse won't file a complaint, the police may in some jurisdictions cite both for

'disturbing the peace' and order one to stay away for 1-3 days but won't arrest.

Same thing... If the victim in this case, won't file a complaint, the defense will get the case dismissed.

If you are white, you will most definitely make it in DC regardless of your background.

If black and trying to start over, I'd say go further south to Atlanta or up to NYC. I know Ivy League black people here who are held responsible for every random niglet's bs and struggle to find peers. DC is about networking, and it takes 3x as long to prove you are acceptable to even acknowledge if you are black in this city. It's a waste of time. Black people are also grossly underpaid. DC has the HIGHEST wealth disparity in the country, which is crazy considering it is the most liberal place in the country. A long time ago, blacks could move here and become a doctor or lawyer. Those days are long gone, and most of those black well-to-do black people have moved far away. All that is left are ashes and justifiable racism. It is a trap for black people.

If white, DC is a place with biases overwhelmingly in your favor. White poverty and white convicts are almost nonexistent in this city.

kxqc97d,1btzbaj,600George,"That's not really the history of the Navy Yard area. Fifteen years ago, Navy Yard was not a bad neighborhood so much as it wasn't a neighborhood at all. It had some industrial areas like the trash transfer station and a few cement plants and a lot of two story warehouse buildings. Some of those warehouses were empty and decaying in place, some were being used as auto repair places, and a few had been been converted into art studios. There was at any given time one or two large night clubs in warehouse spaces and a small strip of gay bars that tended to attract closeted men from the suburbs (and cops who would harass them, but that's another story).  Oh yeah, and some part of the intelligence community had a giant windowless (the windows were literally filled in with cinder blocks) building right on M Street that loomed over the area and fed all sorts of conspiracy theories. I think it actually had something to so with spy satellites. There was also a run down horse stable owned by a woman who would give carriage rides around the city. 

The vibe in Navy Yard was more creepy than dangerous. There weren't a lot of criminals since there weren't any people to victimize. Just block after block of nothing, especially at night. 

Two major events changed things. First, the Navy announced that it was moving a bunch of offices from Crystal City to the Navy Yard. Each of those offices was supported by private military contractors who came along and needed places to set up shop. The only office building at the time was the Maritime Plaza at the east end of M St, so new buildings were needed. US Department of Transportation helped out a bit by moving its HQ from L'Enfant Plaza to a new building on M St (and DOT employees were not happy when they made the move since nothing else on M St was built yet). 

Second, the city announced that it was building a baseball stadium in the area and would buy up many of the warehouses to create a new neighborhood. What the city didn't buy or get through eminent domain, the private developers bought up. 

Somewhere online there is or was a blog that tracked the changes in the Navy Yard area and has a lot more information on the history of the area. 

Bottom line, Navy Yard isn't going anywhere. Not unless the Nationals move and the Navy closes up shop. 

By the way, whatever happened to the gay bars? Councilmember Jim Graham tried to get some space for them near DuPont Circle, but the bars couldn't afford those types of rents and, quite frankly, the rest of that areas didn't really want these seedy places moving in. Another plan was to let them operate rent free in the underground trolley tunnel under DuPont, but that never came to pass and they just disappeared, I guess.",67,2024,4,2,1,6

kxpgfd1,1btzbaj,ncblake,"Sorry you’re dealing what this. 

What’s happening is probably management being worried about lawsuits, first from the resident(s) causing problems, who can complain that their rights have been violated in the event they notify others about an “alleged” incident, and from you, for failure to uphold lease terms, which is why they don’t want to put anything in writing. 

It’s not how it should be, but sadly I’ve heard this story many times from different buildings. The downside to DC’s strong tenant protection laws is that there isn’t much that building management can do in the short term to deal with residents who are causing problems. Legally, they are innocent until proven guilty (which, conservatively, will take more than a year) and building management isn’t able to  treat them differently than any other resident. 

At the end of the day, all you can really do is share your experience. You might consider trying to meet with your councilmember’s office, just to get their take on whether you can additional recourse to get out of your lease. 

If you _really_ want out ASAP, you might consider paying a lawyer some money to write a letter to management that documents your experience in writing, points to their deficiencies in meeting the lease terms, and offering to drop the matter if they’ll let you out of your lease prematurely.",-1,2024,4,2,1,4

One thing I believe is that public housing and concentrated poverty just does not create good outcomes in America. Maybe elsewhere but not here. The cycles of crime and poverty and desperation are absolutely generational.

The row house I lived in had been heavily renovated by my housemate/landlord, who is a great guy. My rent was really low, especially for how nice the house was, and I was living in a nicer place than basically anyone I knew for often less than cost.

The tough part about living there wasn’t the neighborhood itself, it’s how isolated it was from everything else. Accessing public transit wasn’t especially hard, but it took so long to get anywhere with it as to make it impractical. I almost always drove my own car, but even then it could take forever to get places. Grocery stores were 15 minutes away driving, and often 20+ with traffic. Same for pharmacies, and frankly pretty much everything other than corner stores. Restaurants were at least as long a drive, and the choices were super limited.

But it is still a kickass neighborhood if you know 1) what you want, and 2) what you’re willing (able) to put up with.

That depends a lot on self-knowledge: Your past urban experiences, your noise tolerance, whether you know how to deal with pockets of crime in different forms, deal with winos and junkies and trash littering the streets and bike lanes.

The tradeoff can be incredibly cheap rent, in absolutely beautiful housing, with a fantastic commute, and few nuisances other than noise, strung out bums littering the local metro stop, and occasionally the sound of gunshots in the distance at night (if you keep your windows open).

When I first came to DC, I initially moved to Capitol Hill after several years living in a megacity in the global south (I won’t say which, but est. 20+ mln pop.) and prior to that, a very ghetto segment of a major American city - both for work.

Safeway and Lidl are a little over a mile away so it was more convenient to drive but I often stopped coming home from work and got back on the bus. 

Now I will concede that there 6 carjackings in nearby Suitland Terrace in June/July last year but it has been quiet since. I also called police twice late at night when I heard gunshots, one burst very close. I was reassured that the vast majority of murder victims have a criminal record - gang members targeting members of other gangs. My car was never broken into though I twice saw cars that had had all their wheels stolen.

I will also concede I am a 6’2” male so the experience of others may be different. As the only white guy around, I was something of a novelty and I was disheartened on a few occasions when I sensed people were deferential towards me because I was white which speaks to the culture some of them grew up in where white people demanded preferences over black people.

What I can tell you is that I’ve met plenty of people who grew up in very rural areas who have negative reactions to living in loud city neighborhoods. Columbia Heights is one of those neighborhoods, especially in the summer, and particularly if you live near the metro or on 16th. There is almost constant noise and stimulation. If you grew up in a very quiet area where people left their doors unlocked, proverbially speaking, Columbia Heights will take some adjustment. If you grew up in, say, Queens, you might not mind. But noise pollution has a real effect on people. 

Additionally, if you don’t know how to watch your back coming home from the bar late at night, or think it’s cool to leave your garage unlocked for a few days- you’re in for a surprise. But theres very little if any crime that youll encounter if you have some basic street smarts. 

Bike lanes are kind of a mess in Columbia Heights. Should be the easiest way to get around in DC, but instead it’s a liability to life and limb. You can bike this area easily if you’re going laterally, to Mt Pleasant or other adjacent areas for groceries, errands or fun - but I’d recommend against commuting by bike all the way down 16th St. to downtown. Take the S2 bus instead (it’s a breeze), don’t risk your life.

The metro is great to have here too, and as long as you’re not living on the main drag (very loud area), then walking to the metro is fine. It’s messy, yeah, but I’ve never once felt unsafe.

I’m in my early 30s, and no, this area is absolutely not “car required.” If anything it’s “car liability” - mine’s been broken into twice and I’ve seen cars parked on the street once or twice magically lose all four wheels over night. 

It’s honestly one of the best locations in DC if you can stomach a bit of roughness. Believe me, no matter what you think of this area day to day, you’ll always thank yourself for choosing a spot near Rock Creek Park.

And the adjacent neighborhoods are some of DC’s best hidden gems: Purple Patch, Red Derby, Lymann’s, Chicatana…


Im giving you Columbia Heights’ nitty-gritty details in most blunt form so you know realistically what to expect. The “horrid” reputation this neighborhood has is entirely undeserved, an infantile fantasy of DC’s pearl-clutching mimosa crowd who need something - or someone - to look down on and belittle because they can’t yet afford a mcmansion in the suburbs like mom and dad.

I also think that it was a loooot worse a few decades ago, from talking to other people I know who’d been in DC their whole lives. If I were to guess I think it’s almost like Alphabet City in Manhattan, where it’s a neighborhood that gentrified slower than the ones around it and retained a worse reputation because of that fact.

kgymz60,191pur6,jackiejorp-jomp,"Not trends per se, but overall positives…

I’m a transplant here and have lived in several other cities. I love how clean it is to walk around on a daily basis. I know that cleanliness comes with some negative politics sometimes, but this city was designed around (and invests heavily in) being a picture-perfect ode to the US for tourists, and it shows, at least in NW. Trash isn’t left out in heaps in the street à la NY, no human feces or urine to skirt around on every block…buildings aren’t a haphazard mix of low-cost builds but overall cohesive and either stately or quaint rowhouses. Very few major cities are as well kept up.

Nature is a very short drive away. Not only in Rock Creek Park, which feels way more rural than any other large urban parks I’ve been in, but also the MD and VA state park 30 mins away by car are something you’re hard pressed to find in many cities around the world in such close proximity, not just the US. Essential as a dog parent and nature lover. Being 100% in an urban environment every single day makes me a little nuts. Having a quick escape is essential.

It’s easier to make friends here than other cities. I’m not saying people here are the warmest on the outset (because many are type A), but because of it’s transient nature, most people I’ve met are eager to make new friends and are way less clique-ish than other (mainly West Coast) cities.

Free social stuff to do. Not just the museums, but outdoor street festivals etc. make it so even those on a tight budget can socialize outside the home without spending a boatload (not possible in a lot of other cities, where even many of the street festivals require paid entry).

Truly beautiful sunsets not blocked by towering buildings. I honestly love skyscrapers, but the fact that we can actually see the sky from anywhere even with the urban setting is pretty clutch.

As someone mentioned, the seasons. I didn’t grow up with this, but it’s a nice break up of the year, and each season has a distinct character and something to look forward to. Also, each season really does seem to last in 3-4 month chunks so they don’t get overwhelming. Some cities really have a 9-month winter followed by two weeks of spring, an epically hot summer, and then two weeks of fall. Our seasons are way more evenly paced and mellow while still being distinct.

Rooftop pools (and rooftops available for public use in general). These are way more prevalent here than in a lot of other cities that I’ve found (and not epically expensive to use), with a hot enough summer to enjoy them. I’m a big fan.

WALKABLE. A surprising number of cities are clusters of walkable neighborhoods with stretches of misery connecting them as a pedestrian. DC is in an elite class (for the US) of cities where you can walk between three-quarters of the city fairly easily, without having to walk along a freeway. In fact, most of the walk will be quite picturesque and pleasant (saying this as someone who’s walked from NE to the wharf before, both through NW and through SE).

Rent isn’t cheap, but the apartments are way bigger than what you’d get in NY or SF (or father out, like London or Paris) and overall kept up better for the same relative $ amount.

Having a rail line connecting us between here and all cities east until Boston within a few short hours is huge. Really doesn’t exist west of us in the US. Rail is slow as a snail and convoluted to get from major city to major city in most of the US.

A good middle ground pace. Doesn’t have the sleepy suburban pace of cities like Denver, doesn’t feel like a massive connection of suburbs with a tiny downtown like San Diego, and also doesn’t have the frenetic aggressive energy of NY. Some might say those are drawbacks, but for people who want a city vibe without so much of the shouting and chaos of NY (don’t get me wrong, I do love NY), DC is a great sweet spot.

Every city has its unique charms, and every city is going *through* it. We’re tuned in through the local headlines we consume to think it’s just DC, but rising crime, price gouging, angry drivers, etc. is a problem in most places (those cities’ respective subreddits will confirm). And caused by issues that happen at a national level (lack of access to affordable healthcare, lack of income and/or housing assistance, quality education, etc.) and not just issues we are dealing with in DC in a bubble. I’m not saying DC is perfect, but it really is pretty spectacular.",5,2024,1,2,1,8

We can’t be too cynical or pessimistic to press for the [right kinds of interventions](https://newrepublic.com/article/177907/violent-crime-crisis-washington-dc). Additionally, violent crime nationwide is going down, so there’s always the chance that DC is just lagging behind but will ultimately fall in line with the broader trend. 

Second, there’s turnover and change, but not all of it is bad. Restaurants are closing but [new ones are opening](https://www.axios.com/local/washington-dc/2024/01/05/best-new-restaurant-openings-2024-pascual-pastis).

That’s not even considering the fact that DC is still the best place in the country for queer people, which evinces a deeply diverse and tolerant city. 

Lastly, there is meaningful progress being made to fix our issues. SNAP is being expanded to help more needy families, truancy issues are being tackled by adding attractive programming instead of incarceration and punishment, and leaders in our city are countering Bowser’s garbage punitive approach to crime with actual substance that, if adequately funded and monitored, could make DC a model for crime prevention.

Despite living for a very long time in a city with hardly any violent crime, I don't find DC nearly as terrifying as it seems many more recent transplants do. The whole city feels much safer and infinitely more connected neighborhood-to-neighborhood than it did when I lived in it.

I think H st will ultimately be fine—it probably won’t be the same in a few years but I think it’ll slowly transition from a city/regional bar destination to more of a neighborhood drag. There’s just such a density of people on the corridor that I think retail will be able to survive, just not on the same “we’ll be able to attract thousands of people from all over the city bc of cheap Ubers” business model. Chinatown is a bit of a mess rn but I think medium to long term it’ll see a new influx of residents as offices turn over to apartments and/or rents get so cheap people move in even if it’s not as desirable of a neighborhood. It’s just so centrally located (with great transit access) that it’ll be fine in the long term. 

It’s kind of interesting on a meta level—we don’t really have a context for what we’re seeing right now in Chinatown/H St (ie an already gentrified neighborhood going through a bust cycle).

Amazon has provided a market for fenced goods and the companies targeted for theft have decided it's cheaper to factor in some amount of shoplifting and put their stock behind locks than pay for additional staff. The cost of living has exploded and wages haven't kept up. So if someone has no moral objection to stealing and thinks they can make more money in less time, with less effort doing that than a regular job, what's stopping them? 

Stricter, more aggressive law enforcement could stem the problem in the short term, but it could also put innocent people at risk if things become violent, it wouldn't guarantee that stores would go back to the way they were, and it wouldn't address what motivates people to steal in the the first place. Making legitimate options for work more appealing and attainable would be a pretty effective deterrent against criminal behavior.

People fall into roughly three categories: 

1.) Will never shoplift

2.) Might shoplift

3.) Will always shoplift

But even in the third category, there's a wide variety: folks who steal everything, and someone who'll buy a bunch of stuff, but not pay for a couple of small items.

**Q**: Would the bike lane on Connecticut make it a single lane in each direction for cars?

**A:** Thanks for reading and asking a substantive question! This is probably a much longer answer than you expected, but I don't have any other place to dump this backstory.

The 3.2-mile segment we've been arguing about has a few different cross-section configurations, and DDOT's preliminary ""Concept C"" design alternative maintained 2 vehicle travel lanes in most spots. In fact, the agency preferred to keep that second travel lane instead of retaining curbside parking, something they are also doing on the East Capitol safety project in Ward 7, where they've unnecessarily pit parking against safe-for-all bike layouts. The planners get scared when their severely outdated traffic models give them bad grades, so they often prefer to axe parking that serves residents so thru-drivers who live in MD and VA aren't mad.

In heavy commercial blocks, DDOT would reduce the second vehicle lane on CT Ave to retain targeted location parking areas. Before the Mayor canceled the bike lanes, DDOT narrowed the planned bike lanes to fit a few more parking spots. Another important aspect of the previous preferred design is that they added ""turning pockets"" so that left-turn attempts would not back up travel in a general traffic lane. In traffic modeling, this improves ""vehicle level of service"" such that drivers get reduced travel times as the turning vehicles get out of the way. There were Forest Hills Connection stories about many of these design choices and past public meetings but the Connection's website is down now. The Ward3Bikes group is a good place to ask for information, as they've been tracking the discussion of the project's community advisory group for many years.

This project is enigmatic of a problem DDOT has when designing high-profile, multimodal safety projects. It's an issue with their IMPD division, which does giant projects fine (Douglass Bridge) and constantly fumbles ""medium-scale"" projects like CT Avenue. There are passionate, capable folks who work there that are now, I swear, finally starting to choose safety instead of old-school bullshit transportation design thinking. But, rarely do our elected leaders enable them to favor safety. Only some selected councilmembers (see diff between Frumin and T. White on this), some ANCs, and only sometimes the Mayor depending on that quarter's CRE interest thoughts regarding the business value of a parking spot vs. a customer or worker arriving by bike. It is not a coincidence that the C Street NE re-do in Kingman Park/Hill East is the gold standard of this kind of project (W6 represented by Tommy Wells, then Charles Allen) compared to a bunch of potential roads with safety fixes in Ward 8.

The District has a lot of very dangerous 6- and 4-lane roads with ""rush-hour restricted"" curbside parking. Rush hour restricted parking is almost always really dumb from a design and safety perspective as that extra vehicle travel lane only serves the goal of making major arterial roads eject In/Out car commuters like it's 1957 and the father from Leave it to Beaver needs to get home to see Beav's baseball practice. From a parking supply and operations perspective, again, it's outdated. Much of D.C. DPW's very limited tow and boot crew is devoted to rush-restricting parking enforcement instead of any number of higher-value community safety goals like finding cars with thousands of dollars of unpaid speeding tickets. And, again, the narrative for that rush-restricted parking is the 9-to-5 office worker comes home and can have that spot from 6 PM to 7 AM, like we all have traditional biz hour jobs and don't work hybrid schedules or the third shift.

If you look, you'll see safety opportunities throughout your daily travel across our city. CT Ave is a prominent example of what should be a 6-to-4 or 6-to-3 road diet with protected bike lanes and prioritization 24/7 enforced pick-up/drop-off and handicapped parking or a second travel lane in different segments based on the adjacent land use. Since 2022, the Mayor has gradually injected herself into the CT process to take space away from bikes based on some understandable resident and biz concerns -- but mostly some bullshit ignorant and/or powerful people think. The latest concept that's been discussed in the press -- a 6-to-4 road diet with the curbside lanes being turned into permanent parking everywhere -- is such a phenomenal waste of opportunity as to inspire my suggested Council action on the matter: force-protected bike lanes in that extra space or defund the whole project. CT Avenue NW from Dupont to MD is one of our city's primary transportation corridors and has priority for future improvements on both transit and bike within the master transportation plan.

I think the most transformational self-reflection I've had is to understand that my paradigms of thinking about infrastructure and public space are \*incredibly radical\* in America -- and to find power and pride in that self-knowledge. My primary source of angst is the world and people in the world not understanding and agreeing with all of my thoughts about transportation X climate X social justice X housing X economic development. But, our salvation as radicals is that most people in general and in America are practical above all else.

Learning from the wisdom of our forebears, we know progress on tough issues is incremental and sometimes all at once in the last few years. So, every small win of a protected bike lane next to a CitiBike station in a CitiBike network with more e-bikes means more people will ride. Compared to Electric Cars, E-bikes are much closer to being practical for people in urban and streetcar-suburban environments. And truly, I think e-bikes will change the world with every little notch. We can make it practical to take a bike instead of a car or connect to transit for the last/first mile.

I am also a systems thinker, and working now with the intersection of all built infrastructure, there are intersectional dynamics all over the place: ""Straight piping"" wastewater in poor, rural communities where there is also no public transit, for example. And, honestly, the most impactful thing we can do is often be a quiet, reasonable outlier. I take transit and then an e-bike to meetings in D.C.'s exurbs. People see me take off my helmet in the room. My first dates see my helmet strapped to my bag. I bike places because I believe in the transformative power of bikes. And I hope to die many years into the future when that transportation modal decision is an extremely boring and non-notable part of nearly every American's day, even if they have a setback SFH in a cul-de-sac -- because their suburb has hundreds of miles of trails connecting to essential destinations.",4,2024,4,2,1,7

eedmlti,ahdaid,Central-_Scrutinizer,"I’m not excusing this stuff, but this is a city, and there will always be these types of incidents. Unless you want to live in a police state, crime like this will happen when you live in a dense urban area. The best we can do is make sure the police are set up to catch people who perpetrate crime, that city policies steer people away from crime, and that the victims of crime have access to help and support.

There is this strange and detached assumption that a city needs to be absolutely safe or free from tragedy. These tragedies are sad but as a 7-yr resident of the area, I can attest the area has never been so safe. Any peek-a-bo at crime stats will show a reduction in crime, especially if we judge crime per-capita. The area may even be getting too safe - aggressive gentrification may be pushing out the typical communities and businesses that would deter people from the sort of crimes you are referring to in the first place.  My comments here shouldn’t be seen as a defense of criminal activity, but the expectation that a dense area will be free from criminal activity is unrealistic.  

The U area has always had issues, and they are largely in the past. Assuming that things are getting worse is not congruent with statistics or development happening in the area. ",-1,2019,1,2,1,8

eee6u8s,ahdaid,,"That may be a result of the 2015 spike. With that being said this is what I got when I looked into violent crimes in Ward 1, which is the area they are talking about.  **All violent crimes** **went down** **by** **394** **in Ward 1 during the past 2 years** **when compared to the previous 2 years.**

This is what I get when I am looking into violent crime over 5 years for Ward 1 specifically just to get more accurate data  on the 5 year basis.  **All violent crimes** **went down** **by** **1,770** **in Ward 1 during the past 5 years** **when compared to the previous 5 years**

So yeah Ward 1 is pretty much seeing a decrease in violent crime.

Also don't think the heat map is comparative. You really should be doing things on a ward by ward basis when doing analysis, and not necessarily citywide. Largely because Wards 7 and 8 really do skew the city wide statistics. Because DC west of the river and DC east of the river in terms of violent crimes kind of exist in two separate universes.

Also use the Ward tool when using the DC atlas as supposed to looking at

Again it really depends how you modify the data. I usually don't do five years because things can change over a five year period, and a one year spike can change the data. 2-3 years is a bit better.

Also I stress using VIOLENT crime as supposed to all crimes. Property crimes are up, but in large part because of package theft and theft from autos increased. The package theft issue increased with Amazon becoming more of a thing. This is pretty normal when a city is gentrifying. Violent crimes go down, property crimes go up. When talking about safety, it really is violent crime that is an issue, especially since the person is speaking about violent crime. ",6,2019,1,2,1,8
eedw5de,ahdaid,,"Columbia heights and Ward 1 is really just one area of NW. I am going to be honest, I feel completely fine in Ward 4 in my neighborhood of Takoma, which is also in NW. Ward 1 out of all the NW wards (there are 4) has always had more issues with violent and property crimes compared to the other 3 NW wards. 

I have been in DC long enough to know that Columbia Heights occasionally spikes, and has never been the best neighborhood of NW. NW in general though is still the safest area of the city (NW compromises most of Ward 4, Ward 3, Ward 2, and Ward 1). The issue here is with the densest area of NW, which is Ward 1. So please, be aware NW does not just equal Ward 1, and the problems in Ward 1. It is the largest quadrant of the city. That covers everything from Chevy Chase, DuPont Circle, Adams Morgan, Takoma, Shephard Park, etc. Much of NW, especially in Ward 3 and 4, is pretty sleepy residential neighborhoods on both sides of the park. Columbia Heights, U Street, and Shaw are not the entirety of NW. If we must refer to that area collectively, it is just better to call that specific area Ward 1, which is the densest ward in the city. Instead of NW.

NoMa seems tough lately too).

There are 4 wards that make up NW, wards 1, 2, 3, and 4. The other three tend to be far safer than Ward 1, which has always had more issues with violent crime and tends to have more spikes.

So, sorry, we do see do see a negligible increase in crime in Ward 1 between 2017 & 2018 - but compared to 2015 & 2016, we see a reduction of crime in the area - and if you dig into the statistics, you'll notice that the largest reduction was seen in violent offenses. [I invite you to look at the data for previous years as well](http://crimemap.dc.gov/Report.aspx), the area has never been safer. And we're not even talking about crime per capita here - the area has seen an explosion in housing and development (I'm unable to pull up population statistics right now, but if you can find one, I assure that you'll notice an increase in population).

This data jives with developments in the area. Posh restaurants and upscale shopping have replaced the dives and bargain stores in the area. This is one of the most busy parts of the entire city, with a large night-life scene maintaining foot-traffic well into the night. There is a noticeable police presence for anyone who has spent more than 5 minutes buying over-priced whiskey in the U Street/Cardozo area.

ct6llad,3din45,MediumPotato,"So, there are zoning regulations in DC that require a certain percentage of affordable dwelling units (ADUs) for new development and significant renovation/rehabilitation of existing buildings that is increasing the square footage by 50%. These kinds of inclusionary zoning (IZ) laws are found all across the country and different jurisdictions will refer to them by different names (Moderately Priced Dwelling Units or MPDUs for example). There is a common misconception amongst certain people, and certainly developers do nothing to discourage these impressions, that developers are strong armed into providing housing in their new developments that severely limits the profitability of the project and provides no benefit whatsoever to the owner. It is seen as liberal social engineering and trying to regulate progressive housing policy through manipulation, intimidation and onerous regulation. This is simply not the case. 

IZ comes with incentives, often in the form of tax credit or bonus density. These are both part of DC IZ zoning law. While these incentives often do not FULLY make up for the cost of including affordable units, they significantly offset the inherent costs and provide developers with enough of a carrot to make the acceptable profit margins still work. The bonus density is the incentive most taken advantage of by DC developers. Essentially, when you meet the criteria necessary for included affordable units you can build  20% more gross floor area (effectively more market rate units) of building than you would normally be limited to in that particular zone. This is huge. There are certain fixed and slow growing costs in building construction that have enormous potential for efficiencies of scale that bonus density allows for. Those elevators and shafts, those amenity spaces, your centralized mechanical equipment, the building's foundation and structure, your loading dock, the cost of rerouting existing off site utilities, etc etc are all either fixed costs or slow expanding costs that the ability to spread them over more units (revenue generating square footage) makes much more affordable. I've been a part of projects where this bonus density gained from including affordable units has actually made the building PROFITABLE based on the bonus density available. Additionally, developers have no requirement to make the ADUs the exact same as the market rate housing in their buildings, so they will almost always use cheaper finishes and appliances  in these units. Per square foot, the ADU is not costing the developer nearly as much as the market rate units.

So now the reputation that they are just mini section 8 housing projects in the middle of luxury apartments of condos that YOU are paying full price for and THEY are living high on the hog on your and the tax payers's dime. This is absolutely untrue and NIMBYism to the highest degree. ADUs are based on median income in the geographic area where the building is being constructed. You'll often here of families in DC that have an adjusted gross family income of under 20k. These people are not able to afford ADUs in buildings like Flats 130. The whole point of IZ is to try to allow working individuals or families the opportunity to live and benefit from communities with higher standards of living and perhaps be able to afford to live in the neighborhoods where they work. Often one of the biggest complaints and shortcomings of IZ is that it does not produce nearly enough affordable housing compared to what is being displaced by new luxury development. This is a very fair criticism. IZ is a small drop in the overall bucket of building livable, safe, and close knit communities for those with less means. What is not a valid criticism however is that there is inherent violence and crime caused by including these units, and this should either lead to their phasing out or special security measures to keep these areas quarantined. To be frank, this kind of talk offends me on a very deep level and speaks to a corrosive attitude amongst a certain subset of this subreddit and washington dc as a whole. There is no evidence whatsoever that residents of ADUs in new development are more prone to bringing a criminal or unsafe element into these new buildings and that fear speaks to a deeper class phobia amongst the people expressing those opinions. Developers and owners who I have sat with in meetings have expressed these types of fears to my face and it is disgusting, as are people on this subreddit who suggest separate doors, elevators, and security oversight. It is a shameful opinion that poor people are best left to their own devices in walled off enclaves, shuttled to shitty underperforming schools and given access to a fraction of social and community services those in other parts of DC are entitled to. It is so easy to demonize an entire group of people based on income by the way we read the crime blotter and start to work ourselves into a frenzy. 

Anyways, enough of me trying my best to explain IZ. Any more and I'll probably be accused of being a Bozzutto plant.

Pepper Spray or a firearm are not magical talismans that keep evil at bay.

You need the mindset to use a weapon and be willing to cause harm to another person.
You need the skillset to use the weapon.
Then you actually need the weapon.

If one of those components is missing, then you will not be successful at defending yourself. 

Mindset is the most important. If you are not willing to harm another person to defend yourself then the toolset or skillset doesn’t matter. The old shibboleth of “the attacker will just take it and use it against you” comes from this lack of mindset.

So I think you need to ask yourself that question. The toolset isn’t necessarily relevant. Do you have the mindset to fight?

k60f9qy,17bjxhl,jellyfishbake,"With the rise in crime you can make yourself look less attractive, or minimize the impact of the crime. Basic, common sense, methods are carrying a wallet with minimal information and cards in it. A DL, one credit card, and 80 to 100 bucks in cash is always a good way to go. Alternatively, you can carry a fake wallet with some older defunct gift cards, a bad ID, and 100 bucks in cash. Keep your real ID, a card, and a credit card in a money clip, or something that does print inside your pocket. The robber will gladly leave with the fake wallet showing 100 dollars in it. As for your phone, well, the robber will ask for your code. If you can set up a remote lockout that is best. Or just have a shitty phone like me and easily replace it later. As for making yourself a less attractive target, be beige, don’t wear fancy watches or jewelry, or fancy shoes and clothes. Keep alert and show you’re alert when on your own, or with friends. Look at people in the eye, let them know you see them. Even a simple glance. That sometimes can be enough to give the robber pause and find a simpler, less aware target. Like people have posted, they’re looking for people who are not paying attention to their surroundings, who they can stun and run.

If that’s correct, you are living along one of the most prominent fault lines of gentrification in the city. 

You have to your east a few historically black neighborhoods (which are still black) that were built on the banks of the Anacostia river explicitly because no white people wanted to live there as it was where the sewers all dumped into the river and essentially one big environmental hazard. 

These neighborhoods (Kingman Park, Langston, the part of Rosedale east of 15th street) are “resistant” to gentrification to a certain degree for a few reasons: housing projects which are prominent and difficult for developers to build around, kingman park having the legal protection of being a historic neighborhood, and the lack of a metro stop nearby aside from stadium armory. 

But everything to the west of them, all the way up to 15th street has already been rapidly gentrifying to the point that the wealthier people are moving in faster than the poor people can move out. And the demand is still high in that area and will only grow with the addition of the C street bike lanes and depending on what they do with RFK.

In fact this line is so prominently identifiable that in the recent redrawing of the ward lines, everything east of 15th street was cut out of ward 6 and became a part of ward 7— which is the city’s way of saying the people on either side of the line don’t have the same issues or interests the way they once did.

If you've lived in a major city and are aware of the things to avoid, you'll be fine.

I've walked with my wife and infant at night without being harassed, but generally have a good idea of who or what to avoid. 

That being said,


If you're unfamiliar with city life, here are a few common tips:

Don't go walking in dark alleys at night. 

Don't confront groups of people. 

Don't walk alone in the dark with headphones. 

Don't walk around displaying wealth (expensive jewelry, goose coats, gucci purse) in impoverished neighborhoods. 

Avoid unnecessary eye contact.

Pay attention to your surroundings.

And, above all, trust your gut instincts and leave an area if you don't feel safe.



What we call ""instincts"" are often triggered by a person's micro observations. We hear things or see things that we fail to put much focus on, but part of our mind has combined to recognize as markers of potential threat.

The typical reactions for this feeling are:

-Hair on the back of your neck raising

-A feeling as though you're being watched.

-Sudden feeling of not being okay, a sense of dread.

-Unintentional clenching of muscles, often hands into fists, clenched jaw, but also shoulders, feet, stomach.

-Senses suddenly more acute. This is an adrenaline response. Your body is pushing out the fight/flight chemical. 

-A feeling like there's a heavy rock in your stomach, also called a pit in your stomach.


Again, I live here as a family man. I am rather risk-averse.

That could certainly be the case, but not stocking and staffing the store is a deliberate corporate policy that is enabling/creating the problem. Columbia Heights 20+ years ago wasn't a utopia and the store was able to open and deal with theft while overcharging for products. Due to increased competition, their profit margins are so thin now that they can no longer charge the absurd prices they could before and that's the real reason why they are neglecting and closing their retail stores. It's no longer a viable business model and they have been forced to try to pivot.

This would have been impossible before (the store used to have serious security and at least 5-10x, maybe more, the employees it has now). What do you think is going to happen when a store has that policy and people are aware of it? Businesses have a responsibility to run their businesses in a safe and coherent manner in a community and CVS isn't doing that. 

I actually remember when that store and some of the other first chains moved into CH and one of the key negotiations with those businesses at the time was assurances that they would take measures to have a coherent security plan for the stores--both for customers and workers.

I'm actually shocked that anyone would defend the company. They overbuilt in the city during their boom time, and now they're paying the price for it. All of these chain-store closures correlate to businesses who have lost competitiveness to online shopping and profit margins due to higher rent and labor costs.

Plus in Mount Pleasant you can walk out your front door and into Piney Branch Park/ Rock Creek Park and just hike for miles and miles and forget the world. You can also walk up into Crestwood and admire all the giant rich people mansions. Also the little Main Street of Mount P has a movie theater, grocery stores, a bunch of good restaurants, fun bars, and a farmer’s market. And when you’re bar hopping up and down main street it does seem like it’s mostly people who live nearby and are usually chill which is not the case in plenty of other DC neighborhoods.

Petworth - Bars and restaurants are nice, love having Timber Pizza right there. Farmer's Market on Saturdays is awesome. I'm close to the library which has been way more helpful than I had even thought it would be. I used to live in Silver Spring, and having to go almost anywhere meant getting in the car.

Before that there were also shootings on our block - between Sherman and Upshur. Our house was broken into while we were home. Our neighbor was held up in front of their house by children and ditched the gun in the alley behind our house-again between Upshur and Sherman C. There was a shooting at the Petworth playground on a beautiful Saturday morning while families were out and parents took shelter with their kids under playground equipment. I could go on. Let’s not forget about the dad that was almost beaten to death after allowing neighborhood kids (and I mean kids…all under 15 yo) to play with his basketball hoop and ball. He let them play for hours and asked them to kindly stop in the later evening since the hoop was under his sleeping child’s bedroom window. They responded by stomping him and essentially breaking his scull. This happened after COVID lockdown…pretty sure it was within the vicinity of Sherman Circle too. Maybe Grant. I don’t exactly recall but relatively speaking they are close enough. Also not comfortable taking risks walking to Safeway or the Metro and wondering if they’ll be a drive by like there was at the cvs this weekend.

imbiq2h,x09jwk,AnonyJustAName,"No, read the article at link again re: carjacking.

It will be ""robbery"", with a much lower penalty.

""Robbery and Carjacking Penalties

The RCCA proposes creating three gradations of Robbery, depending on the level of bodily injury suffered by the victim, and the type of property that was involved. A robbery that did not result in serious or significant bodily injury, and where the property taken was valued at less than $5,000, would be categorized as Third Degree Robbery, with a statutory maximum of 2 years’ incarceration. Committing this offense while armed with a firearm would be categorized as Enhanced Third Degree Robbery, with a statutory maximum of 4 years’ incarceration, with a higher maximum penalty if the firearm actually caused bodily injury to the victim. The RCCA also proposes subsuming the offense of Carjacking into Robbery. Unarmed Carjacking would be categorized as Second Degree Robbery, with a statutory maximum of 4 years’ incarceration, and Armed Carjacking would be categorized as Enhanced Second Degree Robbery, with a statutory maximum of 8 years’ incarceration. See RCCA § 22A-2201.

While we could support reductions in the maximum penalties for these offenses, the proposed reductions are simply too great. The maximum penalty for Carjacking should recognize that Carjacking is akin to burglary in some ways, as it may involve a traumatic intrusion into a person’s personal and presumed secure space.\[2\] It also results in the loss of what is often a much more significant asset than is lost in another form of robbery. Further, the proposed maximum penalties for Robbery and Enhanced Robbery are insufficient to account for the harms that can be incurred in a robbery, particularly where the robbery is committed while armed with a dangerous weapon. For example, under the RCCA proposal, both a defendant who held a gun to a victim’s head and threatened to kill the victim in connection with a robbery and a defendant who fired a gun indiscriminately at a victim, but did not hit the victim because of bad aim, could each be sentenced to a maximum of 4 years’ incarceration for that offense. A maximum possible sentence of 4 years’ incarceration would be woefully inadequate for such conduct. Notably, the District’s Sentencing Guidelines categorize Robbery as a Group 6 offense—a person convicted of this offense with the lowest criminal history would face a guideline range of between 1.5 and 5 years; a person convicted of this offense with the highest criminal history would face a guideline range of 3.5 years or more in prison. The Guidelines categorize Armed Robbery as a Group 5 offense—a person convicted of this offense with the lowest criminal history would face a guideline range of between 3 and 7 years in prison; a person convicted of this offense with the highest criminal history would face a guideline range of 7 years or more in prison. The RCCA’s proposed departure is unwarranted.""

The carjacking legislation passed in 1993 which had very stiff penalties with NO AGE CARVEOUTS was very effective. But Charles Allen and the current Council will do away with the offense entirely.

Many are not reporting crimes because they feel the city is already inundated, major crimes are not prosecuted, so why waste the time to report some petty theft. The city is making a major mistake by sticking with the well intentioned, but misguided progressive policies that have led to the decline of other world class cities.

If your home was robbed they would refuse to take a report so that they could say that crime was “down”, and that “just” murders were up. Back then most violent crime was geographically confined, and most middle class neighborhoods were very safe. There were a number of horrific crimes just like today, but they seemed more isolated. That could be the effect of social media on today’s awareness. We had the same debates about not using race in descriptions of criminal suspects, the same arguments about improving schools etc. . The voters ultimately rejected the idea of reforming schools and cracking down on crime. Legalizing marijuana was supposed to cut down on the incentives to deal drugs etc. I don’t know what the answers are but it is depressing that we are having the same debates again.",3,2023,7,2,1,6

Ignore them, walk in the opposite direction, and if they corner you, yell fire. That’s the only way to get people on the streets. You are only safe in a crowd.” I was 8. 

I’m a young woman. I don’t walk outside alone after dark. If I can’t afford an Uber, I don’t go out. I always bring a phone charger out. I don’t talk to anyone I don’t know, don’t address homeless people, don’t look people in the eye except if they’re other women. People might think this is cold, but it’s just reality. Call it victim blaming or whatever, but I don’t go out with my headphones on, I leave anywhere if I get a bad vibe, I learned to watch my back in store windows and watch peoples shadows on the ground if I’m being followed closely.

dc has an eerie vibe because the streets get empty. But, most people have such absurd complaints.

The thing is, when your house is broken into, you feel violated. It's a violent act to come into someone else's home, where they, in theory, should feel the most secure. Then if you're robbed or carjacked at gunpoint, it's DEFINITELY more than just a call to your insurance company. It's fucking traumatic and will require a LOT of time (and often therapy) to get over - if at all.

And then there's the *proximity* to crime. When someone is gunned down on your block, mere yards from your house, would you want to stay in the city? Especially if you have young children, your first instinct should be to flee the city and move to the suburbs. At least mine was.

Your example of the break ins proves the points of most people on this thread as those were the actions by one or two individuals who once arrested, largely stopped. The string of robberies the other night also highlights that a few actors are responsible for much of this crime increase. 

 The vast majority of crime is concentrated and is targeted, especially violent crime. And most of that crime occurs in wards 7 and 8, highlighting the long standing issues in DC.

Management was horrible at the building but they did try all they could, including our assistant property manager, a relatively short woman, who actually went and confronted him about what he was doing. I was on a first name basis with the guy and would initially tell him when I saw him in the lobby that he needed to get out because folks might call the cops on him and who knows how that would go. 

When I learned what other things he was up to: stealing packages, chasing women into elevators, shitting in the lobby trash—I just called the police when I saw him in there. 

Before I knew how much management was trying, I went to speak to them about the issue and our assistant property manager told me it was all to no avail because several residents would hold the door open for him (and other folks who ended up being package thieves) as they entered the building, with a college student there also thinking it’d be a good idea for her to cook him some food and give it to him in the lobby.

Is crime up in Admo if you look at it in a one year snapshot? Probably. If you go back 5 or 10 years though it’s far better. Crime in DC is not uniformly spread out and crime can be up in a relatively safe area (Admo) and it can still be safe, and safer than it was in years past. Crime can also be down in very unsafe neighborhoods and they can still be unsafe. 

Crime is more an emotional response/personal perspective issue. You obviously are not wrong in how you personally perceive it, and if you have only lived in Admo for 5 years your going off a lopsided snapshot due to COVID and the national crime trends. There have also been a string of high publicity incidents, which if they happened in other parts of the city probably wouldnt have gotten the media attention. Ward 1 and 2 (since Admo kinda straddles both) remain overall pretty safe areas. 

The concentration of crime has long been an issue in DC and as this highlights, has recently gotten far worse.

> “Anytime there’s a policy that reduces penalties, I think it sends the wrong message,” she said.

“Anytime there’s a policy that reduces penalties, I think it sends the wrong message,” she said.

The new criminal code would eliminate most mandatory minimum sentences, reduce mandatory maximum penalties and allow jury trials for misdemeanors.”

https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/dc-mayor-bowser-vetoes-criminal-code-overhaul/3247124/?amp=1

You can read more context if you actually care to, which you obviously don’t. This was prior to her veto, before the council forced its “weak” hand:

“Bowser said in a letter to Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) that she opposed the proposal to weaken what she termed “already lenient sentencing for gun possession” by reducing the current penalties for carrying a pistol without a license and being a felon in possession of a gun.”

https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/11/15/dc-criminal-code-passes-objections/

So, she was against getting rid of mandatory minimums and lowering maximum sentencing, plus the ridiculous notion of optional jury trials for most misdemeanors.

And, straight from POTUS’ twitter, on not saving the measure because it lowered sentencing for violent crimes:

“I support D.C. Statehood and home-rule – but I don’t support some of the changes D.C. Council put forward over the Mayor’s objections – such as lowering penalties for carjackings.

Even though EOTR is certainly higher in certain crime, Adams morgan, foggy bottom, etc. all have public housing where as other cities administration would just building public housing EOTR happily segregating it.


The US in general has a very large problem where we simply don't have mental aslyums anymore. We ran them very poorly until we stopped having them altogether around the time of Nixon IIRC. Bush also cut of a bunch of funding IIRC because at some point in the 2000s if you tried to commit suicide it went from actual inpatient psychiatric care in hospitals to being handcuffed to a bed for 72 hours then kicked to the curb. That's the same place funding for these people on the streets would come from. Then on top of that the ACLU argued a case that set a precedent that makes it *incredibly* difficult to commit someone without their own or their families consent. So across all of America, if someone needs to be taken off the street because they're having a mental psych episode, if they dont want to go, the only option is jail. 


In DC this is probably, as a guess, not an expert, compounded because we don't have a place to put even people doing criminal acts. One of the perks of no statehood is we don't even have much of a jail. Like think about if we actually arrested every person walking around the city right now obviously out of their mind and who has threatened somebody recently? We don't have the resources to process, hold, and transport all those people. 


With all fentanyl and all the other crazy shit going on this country needs to get over its aversion to long term psychiatric holds. But Republicans don't want to pay for ""freeloaders"" and Democrats dont want to ""marginalize"" already downtrodden people, even if long term care is literally someone's only hope. 


If it had an easy solution we'd do it. But the answer like a lot of DC problems is: we're not a state and we're afraid to jail people, even though the latter happened as a result of good intentions we swung the pendulum too far imho. But what the fuck do I know.",10,2024,9,2,1,4

>It is objectively true that DC has issues with crime, including violent, at a higher rate than many other cities in the US, and at a much higher rate than many other major cities in the developed world. Harassment is obviously correlated. I invite you to look up statistics so we can have an evidence-based discussion instead of an emotional one.

Lol, if you were interested in having a good faith discussion, you would bring the statistics you allude to rather than assume my level of awareness and invite me to ""look up the stats."" And very specifically, please provide evidence of correlation of the other crime to the harassment of women, since you make that claim. I would love to see how car theft is correlated to harassment. 

You moved the goalpost and are now speaking of evidence based discussion but originally used an unfalsifiable claim of your own experience living in several areas. But you seem happy to discount the anecdotes of others and require stats when you receive pushback. ""Normal"" isn't an evidence based term, by the way. It's very subjective and relies on individual perspective. Which is basically my whole point. Someone like my wife who grew up in small town America and has been harassed and assaulted numerous times in her small town life, but has experienced zero of the same since moving to NYC or DC is a great example of of what I'm saying. This isn't a DC problem, period.

Not sure why me saying that men harassing women is a more pervasive issue than is being stated here is the thing receiving pushback, but if you must, I guess, feel free.",-14,2024,9,2,1,5

I agree that Atlanta has lost its southern hospitality years ago after so many transplants moved here. People are still nice though… until they get in their cars and they are downright nasty. I laugh at dmv drivers when I’m there bc Atlanta drivers are so much worse in many ways. When I moved to Atlanta, a southern woman gave me her bed after she found out that I had nowhere to stay that night. Can’t get more kind and trusting than that, but that was 30 years ago. People are not that way anymore in many areas all over the US. I still do think people are more warm in Atlanta though in general. 

In DC metro, there are so many people who are mostly there for government work, like lobbyists, politicians, politician’s interns, diplomats, attorneys, etc and they don’t feel a sense of wanting to belong the way true residents do. My mom had a lobbyist neighbor and he was one of the nastiest people I’ve ever met. Her other neighbor worked for the World Bank and while they were nice, they kept to themselves and their Bangladeshi friends. Also in the 20ish years I lived in dc metro, I don’t recall anyone randomly being friendly as I walked down the street. When I moved to Atlanta and people started saying hi and waving, I was immediately suspicious and grumpy, at first thinking they weren’t greeting me and then “what do they want from me?”  because even though I knew people in my MD neighborhood, no one ever said hi. We definitely didn’t know anyone in my grandparents neighborhood even though they lived there for 30-40 years. And no one ever said hi in the district when walking down the street that I recall. People were usually busy rushing doing whatever they doing. 

I am happy that you are enjoying the DMV though, considering I love it there and miss it a lot. I’ve thought about moving back so many times, but the cost of buying a house and other living expenses there is so much more expensive than it is in Atlanta. DC has so much more going for it, although Atlanta metro is more livable from my pov. I know Atlanta is catching up in terms of cost of living but I still think it’s cheaper here overall, even living in the city. I also miss the intelligence and culture of the people in DC metro.

htjh7lc,s8cihs,classicalL,"So you are mostly spot on in my opinion. I'm a native but I have lived elsewhere. Frankly LA driving style is far worse than the constant complaints about MD drivers by the region...

WMATA is great, second honestly only to living in NYC (which I have done). LA, Boston, Chicago, SF. I've uses these systems (not MARTA though), and DC's transport system is better than pretty much all of those. Maybe SF is close, NYC is better. Right now though it is very empty so. Hopefully that will change. But right now the headways are bad. In the 90s and 00s WMATA was AMAZING. It turned out that was deferring tons of maintenance. But they ran trains to super late with low headways and nothing was broken. We are paying for those days now. Nevertheless it is still a really good system. Go to Europe and have the transit workers all go on strike. The union has problems and the org needs to fix some structural problems but it will get better. If gas prices go up enough ridership will return if people either get used to COVID or it dies back.

DC is largely gentrified out. That's a very different feel than it was in the 90s. Some old timers don't like that, but the city is on the whole a lot safer and cleaner than it was in NE in particular but also near the waterfront.

DC has so many cultural things and many of them free, it spoils you. Again if COVID would just get a lid on things even more stuff about the city would come back and be enjoyed. The region is ridiculously educated. Amazon didn't site HQ2 here just for money reasons... I honestly thing DC was hitting a critical size where it would grow from regional demand rather than just Fed money. 

DC feels more like a city than LA does honestly but less like a city sometimes than even Baltimore because it doesn't have that high rise center that so many cities have with the taller buildings near Union Station or in VA. Hopefully any zoning will be removed and we can have the stuff behind Union Station get really tall and it will feel like that is the city center. I don't know. Berlin has a pretty low rise spread out feel also but it is way dirtier and gritter like parts of NYC and not the good ones.

I guess I have gone on my own tangent but DC's region is one of the best in the country and the best for certain specific things. People are far to enamored with the west coast cities which honestly aren't that interesting for the most part.",2,2022,1,2,1,8

On the other hand the “crime is a reality of city living” view is not environmentally motivated at all— that perspective is socioeconomically motivated (and often race plays a role as well). 

The belief there is generally that crime is an artifact of poverty, lack of opportunity, community conflict, and the trauma of institutional racism which are disproportionately experienced by poor and minority populations. In this sense it is seen as a social injustice to “eradicate crime” from the city because in order to do so one would either have to:

- eliminate poverty
- remove the poor  

And generally the latter ends up being easier to accomplish than the former (and more widely supported by the folks that feel that poor people deserve to be punished; or those that simply don’t want to acknowledge their existence).

> Thai Orchid’s Kitchen offers a peaceful environment and good food, but on December 28, 2010 at around 7:50 p.m., three unidentified men terrorized Bhagirat and his family, robbing them at gunpoint.  The experience threatened Bhagirat and the safety of his family.

> Bhagirat stated: “I couldn’t do anything. The other two walked straight to the back. My daughter was there. We had another helper.  They put a gun to her head and told her to open the cash register.” Bhagirat’s wife, Donna, was in the kitchen. “My wife, I think was doing dishes or something, and she walked straight into him.

Once you shake that with a good hook, they’ll all step down. If you can show me a video of any juveniles fighting that throw a proper hook/cross/jab with any actual power, I’d be shocked. Recall all those high-school brawls and not once did anyone do anything correctly. You don’t need stamina, this isn’t a  30 minute sporting event. Street defense is about full power against an untrained, over-confident opponent harming you or another community member. 

That being said, people trained in self-defense/combat sports should not go around pounding on juveniles. Juveniles also may carry weapons. Even an untrained knife opponent will likely get a few thrusts in before they are incapacitated.

The reason the police give for staying in their cars is that it speeds up response times. If you notice cops are also alone, they are rarely paired up.

You are right about NYC its a much safer feeling city despite having about 10 times more people. Flooding the zone visibly does seem to have a deterrence effect also (like in the subways)

I think a solution is going to involve both more visible police presence between u st and shaw in particular and cracking down on establishments that are serving minors, over serving people or allowing for unsafe patrons to go wild, as well as stopping those patrons when they DUI up georgia avenue back to Maryland or down 9th back to Virginia.

In 2004 the neighborhood was THE going out scene, 18th Street would be so crowded that vehicles the road would be clogged with pedestrian traffic.   At last call it was pandemonium.  In the summer muggings of drunk people was a daily occurrence.  

That year an officer was shot pursuing a criminal.  After that there were large amounts of police, at least 20 officers on the street at night on the weekends.   That continued but gradually lessened until COVID... then BLM.

It is shocking to me that during drinking hours there are not more officers out.  

The police nationwide have changed their approach to policing post BLM.  In my humble opinion police are not paid by the arrest, and I think DC metro decided that they are going to not try as hard to arrest and detain suspects, as well as simply not put themselves in harms way.  Why?  because they don't have to - they get paid regardless. 

Every time and officer tries to arrest someone several of those outcomes result in the officer being fired, suspended, killed, or hurt. Only one is good, the suspect surrenders peacefully, and as I said before they aren't being paid a bonus for that.

Additionally, police should be educated on the law (at least criminal) in a similar manner to law school and undergo deescalation and social service training. Take that 9-18 month police training and and turn it into 2.5 years imo.

Anyways, I do think *some* cops are good and deserve positive recognition. And those cops absolutely do risk their lives if they’re actually doing their jobs. 

Whether it’s traffic management (a Maryland driver could strike at any time), riot control (the ones that defended the Capital from Jan. 6th traitors not the ones that let them in), gang investigation (undercovers could be killed if discovered - we **know** it’s gangs bringing fent into our communities), confronting someone with unlawful use of a gun, saving someone from an abuser, or even some simple traffic stops, the *good* police officers are entering a situation that other professions may lack - an unpredictable and frequently unaccountable variable - other humans.

I’m not going to post clips as proof (they’re on the internet if you’re so desperate to see for yourself), but believe me when I say I have seen bodycam footage of officers responding to situations that should be otherwise safe and peaceful only for the person they are interacting with to suddenly stab or shoot them.

With jobs in agriculture and - to a lesser degree - small engine mechanics, many of the the factors which are dangerous *are* predictable and should be properly accounted for if the job is being performed correctly - many deaths can be avoided by simply paying attention. When you interact with other humans you just have no way of truly knowing how they will react and what their plan is. 

Underwater welders, electrical linesman, and oil-rig workers, however, can prep and account for all they want and they will still frequently die. THOSE are jobs that really truly risk their lives on a day-to-day basis.

e16249u,8t46ru,CaptainObvious110,"Thank you.  There are young women that have lived here for years and don't make this kind of fuss over it.  It's not that I don't understand the importance of feeling safe but certain people blow this out of proportion in my opinion. 

Granted, I don't like when guys whistle at women or catcall as it's annoying and rude.  But some people seem to be afraid of their own shadow.  People aren't always neat and tidy mentally or physically they can have issues but I honestly don't believe any harm will come to you in much of those three neighborhoods.

Mt Pleasant and Columbia Heights anf Cleveland Park are all close to where I grew up especially the first two. The area I would be careful of is to the south of Columbia Heights Metro Station along 14th st.  I also don't think it's a good idea to be alone in Malcolm X Park along 16th st after dark either unless you got people with you.  

There is a certain lady that got upset when I told her that months back but hey she is new to the neighborhood and doesn't know what she is talking about.  

Just the same if you are honestly that afraid please stick to Cleveland Park and hope that the few random homeless people there don't bother you either.

e14pa7x,8t46ru,Bongo-Fury,"Yes, Mt. Pleasant is more “dangerous” than Cleveland Park. But the statistics don’t do the area justice. Mount Pleasant has a larger population and has greater connection to the rest of the city (it really bleeds into Columbia Heights and Petworth) so it will attract more crime. But really MP is more suburban than most parts of the district; more so than Cleveland Park/TenleyTown which is more gated diplomatic mansions flanked by apartments.  MP is poorer and more diverse, and with that comes more crime, but it also has a stronger community spirit that makes most people I know who live there feel safer than the coldness and isolation of some of DC’s western suburbs.

Cleveland Park is safer mostly because it is in the middle of nowhere with little accessibility, and there is practically no nightlife to speak of. For many people this isn’t a drawback. If you are looking for someplace that is simply safer, it’s a better pick. But aside from some nice restaurants and a (really!) great Italian deli, there is not much of a draw to the area.

e14tg1p,8t46ru,Bongo-Fury,"5 other neighborhoods border AdMo, including Mt. Pleasant. Cleveland park becomes a ghost town after 11. If you only judge your neighborhood by its restaurant row you are onto something, but I find that a pretty shallow indication of activity. If you only trying to play in AdMo Cleveland Park is nice, but there are safe, similar communities closer to the city.

Cleveland Park is up a hill, making biking no easy feat.  The red line practically doesn’t work outside of peak times, and traffic is hectic if not unbearable during certain periods, making bussing and driving difficult. Cleveland Park isn’t remote, but it is out of the way unless you are trying to get out of the city or go to TenleyTown.  ",-3,2018,6,2,1,5

My instincts were that something was off, but after 3 ignored texts from him I finally answered and agreed to meet up for coffee the following week. He kept insisting I meet him at 1500 Mass Ave and ignored my suggestions for other places.

Then he said he just moved here from NYC and was looking for good coffee and to meet new people and asked if I wanted to get a cup of coffee with him. I said no that I needed to be somewhere else. He started asking if I lived in the area, where did I work. I was stuck at a crosswalk and had to wait for the light to change in order to get away. He could tell I was uncomfortable and pointed out my wedding ring and said he wasn't trying to hit on me. Then pressured me into giving him my phone number so that we could meet up. I ended up giving it to him (stupid I know) just to get him to leave me alone. I then quickly walked away. He texted me a few times asking to meet up but I never responded. Then about a month ago a man stopped me to ask for directions to a good coffee shop. I was distracted and started giving him directions before realizing it was the same guy. He began asking me to get coffee with him. I said no and quickly walked away. Again this was on 13th and L
Then yesterday I was on 13th and K and the same man asked me for coffee shops. When I realized it was him I froze and immediately walked away. I looked back and noticed he kept turning around and looking at me as I walked away.

He was probably late 30s, graying dark hair (don't remember if I saw hair or if he was in a hat and I saw a short beard) between 5'9"" and 6'0"", medium build.

He asked me out for a midday walk date the next day. On the walk, he spoke almost entirely in sexual innuendos, said that my dress would be sexy if it flew up and proceeded to lift it up in the back on a very populated street.

That's not how it works and your perspective is seriously warped.

(1) multiple arrests in DC

(2) an MPD SUV driving up behind a sedan with lights blazing, multiple cops jumping out with weapons and detaining all 4 occupants of the vehicle on the sidewalk

(3) MPD personnel kill someone just outside my apartment at night (I was asleep and did not witness, but could look out my apt window and see the spot a hundred feet away) - https://www.npr.org/local/305/2021/08/27/1031669151/d-c-police-release-footage-following-their-fatal-shooting-of-antwan-gilmore

Law enforcement has been alive and well here since the BLM protests. Traffic enforcement is a double-edged sword in DC because it’s very easy for more harm to come from a chase. Cops have to choose their battles too.

We do need better ticket enforcement for VA and MD drivers who drive here with no regard for safety. That’s a political/state issue though. We also need better technology for tracking stolen cars, or just to do a better job of discouraging driving in DC.

As far as metro jumpers, it’s likely not cost-effective to have police at every metro gate every day. A person jumping is a few dollars lost income. WMATA is now installing new fare gates which can’t be jumped though; you can see them at some stations.

Rather than this being a “culture” of not enforcing laws, these are complex issues which need solutions. I believe that DC being its own independent state and not having its laws controlled by Congress would go a long ways toward enforcement and not having arrests fall through a mile of legal musical chairs.",0,2023,10,2,1,5
k3kz965,1701rss,FIFA95_itsinthegame,"Lol this topic is definitely a Reddit fave. Where have you been? You think I’m getting upvotes for this?

You can’t have a pharmacy with items to purchase because CVS has decided it’s not profitable to provide that. They’d rather force you to pay for their security.

The reason I harp on wage theft is because I think it matters which crimes we give our attention.  Media attention leads to public focus leads to politician priorities leads to police enforcement.

We spend half a billion per year on law enforcement and yet violent crime continues to rise. 

In my opinion we should focus exclusively on violent crime until that starts to reduce. We can then move to property crime targeted at individuals. If we get both of those under control then maybe we can help corporations protect their assets.

CVS shoplifting losses are less than a tenth of a percent of total revenue annually (.06% in 2022). That’s the equivalent of 60 bucks for someone making $100k.  It’s less than I lose on package theft most years. 

Now imagine how insufferable this subreddit would be if every single person made a new post about every single package they had stolen. It doesn’t mean it’s ok that someone stole my packages. It just means in the grand scheme of things, it’s not that important.",0,2023,10,2,1,5

l0g86q2,1c8jdf2,All_Wanderer,"On Nats Opening Day, she Tweeted a picture of a bunch of police cars in front of one of the I St. buildings in Navy Yard, telling people to avoid the area. I was at Slipstream on that same block around the time of the tweet and had not seen or heard anything; texted a friend who lives literally one building over from the one in De Souza’s picture (facing I St., incidentally), and my friend had similarly not heard or seen anything. Later turned out to be police coordinating for opening day traffic to the stadium, but De Souza never gave any context/update to her photo and the tweet is still up. So she must have been having a slow news day and decided to stir the pot a bit with some half-truths. And it kinda worked: the comments under her post are, of course, entirely unhelpful (about Navy Yard being a war zone), and feature one person blaming crime in the neighborhood on buildings taking renters with housing vouchers. Which, from what I can tell, is the kind of discourse De Souza is aiming to strike up whoever she posts. When again, no crime had occurred in the image she posted.

I don’t have anything against folks keeping their neighbors alert and aware to crime or potentially dangerous activities in their neighborhoods. Navy Yard’s had a few high-profile crimes happen over the last few years, and there’s nothing wrong with wanting to have conversations around what can be done to prevent further incidents. 

But De Souza considerably undermines whatever credibility she may have when she posts to generate fake outrage. As OP said, Yellow had been upfront about their reopening in Navy Yard being temporary because they were planning to open up a new spot elsewhere. Yellow’s own post, which De Souza quote tweeted, says as much. That to me just proves she’s more interested in generating clicks, starting unhelpful conversation, and raising her profile over at Fox News more than anything else.

The ANC has a pretty important role in advocating for local community needs. If those needs aren’t met, it’s not necessarily the ANC’s fault.

h5tjyy6,onh55q,brendanode,"I know a lot of people have chipped in with useful advice but I thought I’d share my experience anyways because it feels relevant 

I was involved in a traffic accident where I wasn’t at fault. I t-boned a car as he tried to make a left turn in front of me and failed to yield. After getting out of my car (I was thankfully ok despite some whiplash) the driver of the car at fault decided to chase me down and attack me, unprovoked except being convinced I caused the crash. He grabbed me from behind and punched my head while I was face down on the ground. A traffic cop witnessed this and pulled him off of me. I was transported from the scene to a hospital and while in the ambulance a police officer asked if I wanted to press charges and I said yes - he shouldn’t get away with violently reacting like that. 

After several weeks of fear given he had my name and address from the citation I was finally able to get ahold of the detective assigned to my case who informed me they decided not to pursue charges. Despite a cop witnessing and this guy having a pretty long rap sheet they felt it wasn’t worth their time. When I asked why they weren’t pushing on prosecuting this guy who committed a violent crime they told me they “didn’t have an answer that would satisfy me”. My alternatives were to sue him myself or let it go, which I did since I just wanted the ordeal behind me. 

I’m not saying this will be your outcome but know they’re apparently working with such limited resources they can opt to not do anything, so just prepare for that possibility.

I mostly take metro everywhere.  Otherwise, I just drive more slowly and people will drive around.

Yes the upper NW has more chill drivers.  People are generally more affluent and are lawyers etc with stuff to lose.  There are some exceptions with students driving like maniacs (I saw a student driving in Tenleytown who flipped his car driving too crazy)",7,2023,4,2,1,6

I don't think this is a unique to DC problem, in rural Canada we have our fair share of idiocy on the road, but in DC it's dense and especially noticeable.

Glad you vented because it's good to talk about these things especially right when they happen. I don't know what to do about it in DC or at home but it does feel like it's gotten worse in the last year or so. Maybe it hasn't? Someone's probably got data on this.

Also feels like in general I've seen more people being selfish and entitled in really obvious and dramatic ways just around town/in public and I think it probably goes hand in hand.

The amount of aggression in the DMV area lately seems to be off the charts; aggression, in addition to incompetent, willfully-reckless, driving. 

I have to pull evasive maneuvers multiple times a day, *every day*, just to avoid accidents. Today around Hyattsville, I hit the jackpot as I had to slam my brakes to avoid being side-swiped, then the gas to avoid being rear-ended by the person who hadn’t paid attention to the whole scene. No more than 10 mins later, I had to slam my brakes again to avoid being side-swiped by someone who seemed to be attempting an insurance scam. Drove suspiciously slow, then veered in the lane I traveled as I tried to pass them (their car already had damage on the side that would be impacted if we’d collided).

If you look at the data for homicides per year, the numbers are 2023 -> 254 vs 2021 -> 226 (12% increase in 2 years)

Sex abuse numbers are 2023 -> 154 vs 2021 -> 181 (15% decrease in 2 years)

kcuwhod,18ewlpw,harkuponthegay,"It depends on what you mean by “size”.

According to the census bureau Richmond has a total area of 62 sq mi (160 km2), of which 60 sq mi (160 km2) is land and 2.7 sq mi (7.0 km2) (4.3%) is water. Meanwhile, DC has a total area of 68.34 square miles (177 km2), of which 61.05 square miles (158.1 km2) is land and 7.29 square miles (18.9 km2) (10.67%) is water. 

So both places are almost identical in terms of square miles of land— now take Richmond’s murders and spread them over that space and you get about 1 murder per square mile. But if you take DC’s murders and spread them over its space you get 4.20 murders per square mile. 

Meaning that in DC you are much more likely to have had a murder committed within one square mile of where you live during the year than if you lived in Richmond. Which makes it feel far less safe to some people. 

And that brings up an interesting distinction— which city feels less safe and which city actually is less safe? The answer is not as obvious as dividing murders by population— because in reality it is highly dependent upon who you are. 

The people that are being murdered are overwhelmingly young black men of lower socioeconomic status. So if you are a black man living in wards 7 or 8 these numbers mean something different to you than if you are a white woman living in ward 2.",-3,2023,12,2,1,4

To legally rent out your basement apartment in DC, you’ll need two things:

1. **Basic Business License (BBL).** This is a document that basically ensures the safety of both you and your renter by giving you the right to do business (yes, even if you’re just operating as a landlord in your own home!).
2. **Certificate of Occupancy.** This is a document that verifies your unit is safe for renting. To obtain this certificate, you’ll need to have your basement pass inspection; otherwise, your rental will be considered illegal. You must have a Certificate of Occupancy before you can get a BBL.

To pass inspection, your basement apartment will need a few things. First, the ceilings will need to be at least seven feet high (for habitable spaces), have two ways of safely exiting the apartment, and have separate heating and cooling.

* Silver Spring is just up the Red Line and has a lot of what you’re looking for

* NoMa is the same in the opposite direction, but is a little more connected to the rest of the city

**George Washington University**

* Foggy Bottom has lots of good housing options

* West End is basically overflow for Foggy Bottom, so check there too

* I know people who go to GW and live in Crystal City, Rosslyn, or even Tysons for the cost and community, so if commuting is your thing then maybe consider those

**Georgetown University**

* Foxhall Village is close if you can find a place

* Living in Georgetown proper is your best bet here, despite the cost, simply due to how difficult it is to commute

**University of the District of Columbia**

* Bethesda is a good option because of metro access

* Adams Morgan is a little pricy but could be a good place to look

**Gallaudet University**

She said no, and then Cooper shot a warning shot into the ceiling — which led to Mahoney running into the hall.

Let's go down the list.  

> the police have decided it’s not worth pursuing the criminals

Obviously hyperbole but if you're gonna ask if anything you said was wrong you can start here.  

>you’re not allowed to complain about here  

4 to 6 of the current top posts in the sub are related to crime, and stories about [crime declining](https://www.axios.com/local/washington-dc/2023/01/05/violent-crime-stats-dc-2022) never get any attention here or anywhere else.  Leading to a [false perception](https://dcist.com/story/23/02/23/dc-crime-adams-morgan-safety/) that crime is increasing.  

>You’ll be called a racist and told it’s a victimless crime cus the only ones affected are the billion dollar corporations.

I looked through all the posts on crime at the top of the sub and literally no one said this.  However, comments *claiming* people say this or using similar strawmen are everywhere and heavily upvoted despite being low-effort, thoughtless, and blatantly incorrect.  It's almost as if there's some politics-driven narrative that trains people to all say the same shit regardless of how obviously incorrect it is.

>Meanwhile we’re supposed to pretend like it’s completely normal to spend 25 minutes in a store, doing multiple laps to find an associate just to buy a tube of toothpaste. 

This does not take anywhere close to 25 minutes.  If it takes 25 seconds you gotta work on your person-finding skills. And by the way, it is normal. Go to any arguably marginal neighborhood in any city - Brooklyn, Philly, wherever. You'll find locked shelves.  You'll even see in on some things in rich suburbs.",-2,2023,2,2,1,5

Bottom line: When people sense that nobody is really paying attention to their little crimes, a sense of impunity seeps into the community, and big crimes follow. Solution: active policing to establish a sense of looming punishment for both small and large crimes. Results in safer communities. This is very much out of step with the times (people are more inclined to focus on over-incarceration rather than under-incarceration, but the transformation of NYC and other major cities suggests Broken Windows was on to something).",5,2021,5,2,1,7

But research  pretty firmly indicates that more police presence, more arrests, and more incarceration will result in less violent crime (i.e., precisely what led to reduced crime in 1990s and 2000s).

There are two Metro stations within a couple blocks of The Atlantis: U Street-Cardozo and Shaw-Howard University. I’d recommend the U Street station due to more foot traffic. There should be plenty of people around after the show; this is a very busy nightlife district. 

There is also the 96 bus, which runs directly between U Street and Woodley Park, but they can be inconsistent and tricky for visitors to navigate. I wouldn’t recommend that as your Plan A.

jc5glgo,11qqlj1,laurelanne21,"Don’t be fooled into thinking Navy Yard is a “safe” neighborhood just because it looks shiny and brand new. There have been several shootings and a carjacking in broad daylight right near Illume so far this year. My partner moved to Navy Yard from NYC and IMO it’s not that there’s more crime here than NYC, but it feels more unpredictable and brazen. I’m not trying to scare you, there’s crime everywhere in DC so there will be something no matter where you end up. Just don’t be surprised when it happens. Be alert and you’ll be fine. 

The waterfront is a nice place to walk and hang out on a sunny day. A handful of good restaurants but otherwise mostly mediocre bars and eats that cater to the sports and concert crowd IMO. If you like concerts it’s awesome being able to walk to one at Nats Park. My overall view of Navy Yard is that a lot of the restaurants, bars, and apartment buildings are facades - they look fancy and brand new and alluring on the outside, but what you end up getting is a toss up. Mediocre food, shitty apartment construction, bad management. Some people disagree; to each their own. 

If you just want to experience a luxury apartment within your budget, north Arlington honestly sounds better - tons of parks and trails, close to the water, easy commute to GW on the orange line, lots of good little restaurants for takeout, and much safer. Most buildings are relatively new - older than Navy Yard but much newer than some of the NW places suggested here.

East Hill has a more homey feel. H street is a bit in-between and offers both luxury apartments & row houses in your budget.

I've said this on a number of crime-related threads, so I'll say it again here though its probably wasted breath.

Its simply not debatable in my mind that the broader neighborhood feels less safe. 

This isn't ""oh we've been on the internet too much"" or ""oh the news is too doom and gloom"". Gunplay that used to be blocks and blocks away and you didn't pay heed to is now around the corner or the other side of the block (literally, twice in the past two weeks). Carjackings seem concentrated here due to the street geometry. over the summer we had groups of kids dumping stolen cars in the middle of the block. cars with paper tags are fucking flying around the neighborhood doing all kinds of wild shit. and on and on and on.

What's most ironic is that the supposedly progressive perspective on this sub on crime/police/etc is 100% anti-aligned with that of the longtime residents in my neighborhood, who want to lay the smack down on these guntoting dipshits more than the gentrifiers. 

People on reddit make fun of next door. go on next door and see who is complaining about crime. Its the exact people redditors here invoke when they mock new residents for being concerned about crime.

DC made enormous strides in addressing its crippling crime problem (Murder Capital in the 1990s) and had a low of 85 homicides in 2012. This year will surpass 200. If it’s far right to say this is an issue for the city and its livability, then fine far right. But as someone who has only voted democratic it is a major quality of life issue and impediment to business. For me the biggest issue is the trend and not seeing clearly the policies and actions taken over the past 5 years have made it worse, if it doesn’t turn around it could be a crime-infested war zone, where right now it’s just a concerning trend that keeps getting closer and closer to home.

I feel like most people choose to live in DC for other reasons knowing that, not deny reality. It really can happen anywhere except perhaps Palisades. If you value safety above all, move to New York, where you'll pay more to live in a more sterile gentrified area with $8 hot dogs. But it's not like the part of Queens or the Bronx you'll be able to afford for DC money is all that much safer than DC. It's not a warzone, it's not an especially dangerous or safe city, but you do have to be smart and be aware that there is a risk. Is that risk worth it, given how low your odds still are as long as you're not out in stupid places at stupid times of the night, and how incredibly boring zero-crime McLean is? I'd say so.

I’ll say that there are homeless/mentally troubled people even in the safest parts of the city, but the majority are not physically confrontational. This is of course offset by the small number that *are* aggressive toward a lot of people. You’ll find that most people establish a “home base” in a particular area, which helps with starting to recognize them and whether they pose a threat. I’m in Glover Park now, and 99% of the homeless people here are just kind of a passive presence doing their own thing. There’s one guy in my area who my dog tends to bark at because of his erratic behavior, which in turn triggers him and provokes a lot of yelling that I don’t love - so we just cross the street when we see him and I’ve never had a problem.

This is how the inner city urban death spiral began in the 1970s: crime caused people to leave the inner city, the city responded to less tax revenue by cutting police, which meant more criminals got free reign, which pushed more people out. Rinse and repeat.

I had a similar incident when a man started to speed walk down the escalator to stand just right beside me. He then tried to raise his arm in front of me, holding a bag of some sort in his hand. When I noticed this I took a quick look back only to see him staring at me without saying a single word. Creepy as fuck.

I'm sure now that it's probably a case of mental illness, and really god knows what he would've done if I waited any longer. I threw away all pretext of civility and just booked it down the escalator and reported him to the first station agent I saw. The guy then finally started talking and raised a huge attitude about ""whatever the hell"" I had told the station agent. 

I managed to slip away as the station agent tried to calm down the man in order to defuse the situation, but it was very disturbing. I never thought that I'd have to run away from something while living in DC, makes me glad that I was wearing running shoes as I was on my way for a jog around the Mall.

> ""We feel that we ... have been absolutely abandoned by the city,"" McDonnell had written in his email. ""The crime and safety issues in that neighborhood are out of control.""
***
> In the original email, McDonnell detailed how his employees had been punched, pepper sprayed, had guns and knives pulled on them, spit on, and had to watch as ""customers have literally tried to kill each other."" He added that one of their employee's sons, who worked nearby, was robbed and murdered – leaving his team distraught about the loss and about the situation in the neighborhood.

> ""All of the above needs to be understood in the context of the lack of police presence. There is none,"" McDonnell wrote. ""Once upon a time there was. 911 calls, if they come at all, take 15-20 minutes. When they do arrive, it seems as if they feel they can’t do anything.""

After WUSA9 found out about this and contacted the management, the management released a public letter saying it was happy with how it's addressing this. In the best case scenario, crime was actually terrible but Clyde's is genuinely happy with the efforts to address that. In the worst, the private communication is how Clyde's actually feels, and the statement of praise that was released immediately after the September letter was a face saving measure (perhaps not to upset the government, perhaps not to scare away patrons). If you're going by the idea that we can't trust what corporations are saying publicly, as it's just a way for them to get public opinion to go in the direction they want, I'm not sure why you'd trust the public letter over the private communication.

The knee- jerk “that’s racist” tag is unhelpful to a productive debate on the merits, and is more often a simple way of avoiding strong arguments by attacking someone’s motives.

This doesn’t specify an intended neck touch, but instead, any touch of the neck inducing pressure on them with no measure of degree. This includes pulling of a shirt, brushing against the neck, or any other incidental action causing contact with the neck. This results in an administrative actions putting the members career at risk, a trial board, the member at possibility of criminal charges, and more. A lot of members have already faced suspension over such incidental touches while this most recent policy has been enacted. So why put hands on anyone to effect an arrest or a stop? Why risk your life when almost every other bit of the system is working against law and order?

People have been suspended for this left and right, and it’s not for what you claim. People get fired or charged for that kind of negligence resulting in death in DC.

This escalation of dangerous shit is why I'm posting, period. It's not about the occasional gang of atvs/dirt bikers that come through a few times a day. It's about a constant stream of it over a significant period of time. They themselves are blocking and slowing down traffic, while also endangering every car, driver, cyclist, and pedestrian near them.

Agree that traffic sucks, but there have already been proposals to regulate/charge a toll for access to downtown DC, like they do for central London, to reduce traffic and promote pedestrian access/bicycle usage. So that's why I suggested those options.

These kids are not DC kids enjoying their summer. These are kids driving in from MD, where there ARE designated dirt bike tracks, who come into DC to cause chaos and show off. 

Yes, police chases have caused rider deaths, which is why police chases were banned.

But since the car chase ban, there have been multiple incidents of pedestrians being killed or maimed as well as car accidents all caused by illegal off-road vehicle drivers.

It's been rising for a decade now.  226 last year and this year looks to be worse.  So the rate is definitely trending in the wrong direction.  Could it be safe again in 10 years?  Absolutely.

I don't know too much about police assignments, as I'm on the fire side.  In fire, we have no choice on where we are placed, but  we can request transfers.

On the east side of 2nd street there's a neighborhood full of long-term residents who've witnessed the bad and the good and they're happy that things are improving. There's a police sub-station on 2nd between M and Florida, too, with plenty of squad cars driving around throughout the day and night. Don't get me wrong, like any neighborhood east of the park, plenty of crimes are committed in the area. I wouldn't say it's any more or less than anywhere else though people might disagree (""But tummlr, NoMa is near North Capital Street!"" ""Tummlr you fool, NoMa is adjacent to the projects"" ""There are clubs in the area!"" etc.) It's crime, it's random, it happens everywhere, and you can protect yourself by being vigilant and using common sense. Even still, shit happens. Will you have to stay in your apartment when the sun goes down? No, there are no vampires in Northeast. 

The best thing to do is this: come around the neighborhood one evening and walk around, see what happens, and make your decision based on that.

hv8kmce,shfun0,RussianPhD,Man. At this point I really wish the feds would clean the city. Eliminate anybody with an illegal firearm and get those involved in crime in prison. It’s dangerous to walk at night in DC these days.,8,2022,2,2,1,3
hr1m0q4,rugwrv,Top_Entrepreneur4317,"In DC all the time. 

Now Is not the officer's call to decide what crime is worthy of their time.  When elements of a crime meet the definition of the DC code are reported to the officer, that officer needs to take a report and make the proper notification if any.

kob64lw,1afiniq,Koboldofyou,"For people living in the city, generally crime is a thing that happens around you. There may be a car jacking a few blocks away. There might be a mugging at the metro one day. But the city averages over 10,000 people per square mile. So there are really a few thousand people closer to the crime than you. 

Add into this that crime is often opportunistic or targeted. Violent groups often target each other. Or criminals will break into a car with a backpack inside. So a lot of the danger can be generally avoided by avoiding certain hot spots and following a few base rules about leaving luxury items out. In general I've generally felt more frustrated and angry about crime than I have unsafe. I'm a young guy so YMMV. 

And for me the benefits of living in the city are way higher than living in Arlington. There is a much greater variety of everything and a much greater closeness to fun things. The walkability is much better and it's far easier to find yourself in a new interesting part of the city. I would still recommend DC over Arlington.",5,2024,1,2,1,7

Why is that? If community engagement is the key, what are they doing that we're not? Can you point to something specific?
