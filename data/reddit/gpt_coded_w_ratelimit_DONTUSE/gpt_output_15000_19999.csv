Only shopped at this location as a last resort a few times when nothing else nearby was open and it was somehow more unpleasant than other Walmarts. Less floor space, less selection, more security theater.

Not saying I'm glad to see it go, I just wish policymakers had any coherent plan to make cities more liveable and walkable, including being able to buy affordable fresh food near where you live.",2,2023,3,2,1,0

I looked up some pictures of the space too per your comment about it being below grade. You're right, that's a really tough space.

This is such an interesting question to me because it's a question those who work in Real Estate have been trying to answer for a while. What replaces big box when they leave or downsize? The space itself is more suited for industrial warehousing or self-storage or data center type of use even (some old big box in NoVa has been converted to data centers) but the locations and zoning of the urban big box such as Macys on G Street makes that completely unviable. Obviously can't have ugly, dirty, freight truck oriented logistics facilities in the middle of downtown streets where people live/work.

You have any take on this? My only thoughts are self-storage, potentially medical office, and/or a creative retail solution like finding a discount gym could probably work. Obviously Douglass Development was able to transform the Woodies Building into Class A office & Retail by chopping the space up, so it can be done.

I know 77H well because I've had friends living there since it opened, and it definitely seems to be showing its wear. Having lived in another Bozzuto building, you could see the difference between a property they are investing in and one that's falling off. They still have the captive market of Georgetown Law students, I guess, but like you say there is more opening up in area, and those are the exact folks who relied on having Walmart below them for groceries, home goods and booze. I guess the building I was thinking of that's towards Cap is Georgetown Grad Student Housing, and maybe there's a new building on the other side of 1st that's apartments? So that is a lot of new residents potentially coming in, but probably not thousands.

I agree with others that this seems like a massive problem for Bozzuto, regardless of who leases the Walmart space, because when I mentioned this to folks I know at 77H the reaction was ""guess it's finally time to move.""

Let's go down the list.  

> the police have decided it’s not worth pursuing the criminals

Obviously hyperbole but if you're gonna ask if anything you said was wrong you can start here.  

>you’re not allowed to complain about here  

4 to 6 of the current top posts in the sub are related to crime, and stories about [crime declining](https://www.axios.com/local/washington-dc/2023/01/05/violent-crime-stats-dc-2022) never get any attention here or anywhere else.  Leading to a [false perception](https://dcist.com/story/23/02/23/dc-crime-adams-morgan-safety/) that crime is increasing.  

>You’ll be called a racist and told it’s a victimless crime cus the only ones affected are the billion dollar corporations.

I looked through all the posts on crime at the top of the sub and literally no one said this.  However, comments *claiming* people say this or using similar strawmen are everywhere and heavily upvoted despite being low-effort, thoughtless, and blatantly incorrect.  It's almost as if there's some politics-driven narrative that trains people to all say the same shit regardless of how obviously incorrect it is.

>Meanwhile we’re supposed to pretend like it’s completely normal to spend 25 minutes in a store, doing multiple laps to find an associate just to buy a tube of toothpaste. 

This does not take anywhere close to 25 minutes.  If it takes 25 seconds you gotta work on your person-finding skills. And by the way, it is normal.

Bottom line: When people sense that nobody is really paying attention to their little crimes, a sense of impunity seeps into the community, and big crimes follow. Solution: active policing to establish a sense of looming punishment for both small and large crimes. Results in safer communities.

tl;dr: nobody knows exactly why there's a massive spike in violent crime in the last couple of years (hint: it's not the pandemic and it's not purely economic). But research  pretty firmly indicates that more police presence, more arrests, and more incarceration will result in less violent crime (i.e., precisely what led to reduced crime in 1990s and 2000s).

If you’re an adult in society, there should be minimum expectations of how you’re expected to behave, and if you’re unwilling or unable to adhere to that then you shouldn’t get a choice as to whether you have to get treatment.

The standard of just letting people take over public space and do this type of stuff is a minor inconvenience when it’s just a few people, but it doesn’t take much for it to spiral out of control.

We had rented our house for 2 years with no issues, but during the pandemic squatters started taking over the abandoned property next to us. First group was a couple shooting up heroin in the backyard and getting into physical altercations with each other. Awful. Even though it was under police jurisdiction as a condemned property, police could do little without hard evidence of physical abuse or admission which the female was reluctant to provide as if often the case. Eventually they moved on.

Next was a rotating group of pretty well behaved junkies. There was one guy who we caught peeping but we addressed this with the “leader” and they took care of it. Knowing the police couldn’t help, we felt better about the situation since at least they seemed to want to keep a low profile and weren’t getting into fights with each other or being loud.

Fast forward a month and we wake up at 4am to the abandoned property completely ablaze. Either crack lighters in a tinderbox house, or an indoor fire to keep warm on the first really cold night of the year. Fire reached and destroyed our home as well.

I understand and empathize and agree with measures intended to help people down in life. But that really fucking grinded my gears. We were living month to month in a great rental where our landlord hadn’t raised the rent (which was rare there) and all that went away in a matter of hours bc the city was unable to evict homeless people living in an already unsafe decrepit tinderbox.",23,2021,5,2,1,"1,3"

I'm going to need to see the impact report that you're sourcing this from. Some NGOs are efficient, but a lot are not, have ulterior motives (e.g. religious NGOs), and actually rely on exploitative labor practices to get anything done. There is also a problem of the redoubling of efforts between many small NGOs attacking the same problem, which depletes public resources without allowing any one organization to achieve the critical mass necessary to finance bigger, structural programming. Sustainability is often an issue: NGOs can fail or face a fundraising issue, and sometimes nobody is left to continue their programs. And because of the short funding cycles of many NGOs (e.g. some grants are annual or less), the issue of continuation of programming can actually loom rather large. 

> That’s why, personally, I’m a big advocate for cutting taxation + wasteful spending and encouraging individuals to step up to the plate, work together, and help their neighbor.

So you're a libertarian. I don't really get it tbh. Government is perfectly capable of handling the tasks that governments are supposed to handle, as long as the citizenry holds it accountable. Replacing government with smaller organizations is less efficient, not more. It means you're wasting more money and effort on supporting the fixed costs of running many small businesses, therefore less money goes to beneficiaries.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/howardhusock/2014/04/10/lesson-for-april-15-why-government-cant-replace-charity/amp/

Two anecdotal experiences:
1. In the county I’ve spent most of my life in, part of the county is a food desert and perpetually poor. Attempts at economic development have mostly failed, and since the majority of the county is upper middle class or extremely wealthy there’s not much interest in continuing it further. Most of these people are unwilling to deal with higher taxes, and because it’s a small county without much economic importance the state government is also unwilling to invest in it. The poorest locals are served mostly by a food pantry, which receives heavy support from local grocery stores as well as donations from the wealthy community surrounding it (be it for tax write offs, looking good, genuine altruism, or a mix of the three). Private charity has shown itself to be much more effective than government here, and is routinely subsidized by the county for that very reason: it would be much more expensive for the government to duplicate their effort than it would be to support the charity.

2. When the storms hit earlier this year, substantial portions of Buckingham, Nottoway, and Dinwiddie County lost power and water for almost two weeks. The state refused to activate the Guard despite declaring a local emergency, and the Department of Emergency Management did not mobilize humanitarian support. Private citizens from across the state raised several thousand dollars and wound up supporting just over 500 families with propane, heaters, firewood, blankets, winter clothing, water, and food until power and water came back on.",1,2021,5,2,1,0

New buildings have tons of space that people get filthy each day. The walls are thin, everything is built really cheaply unless you are paying like $4000+ for a 1 bedroom. Navy Yard is just like NoMa etc with a bunch of newer buildings that are all roughly the same price but it's actually more expensive than NoMa when looking at sq ft to price.

I prefer to live in older buildings because they have much better soundproofing, I legit only hear occasional things dropped on the floor above me or someone walking down the hallway while talking and only immediately in front of my door. I get safer neighborhoods, lower rents, many include all utilities, and RENT CONTROL. I don't need to live in a 8-12 floor building where I pay $2400 for a tiny one bedroom and then rent goes up 15+% and I have to sign another lease (month to month is wonderful after the 1st year). Plus noisy neighbors. No thanks.

Also wondering how Dupont isn't affordable? The reason that prices do start to go up in the spring for some buildings is because there are so few vacancies and everyone wants to live there, plus it's probably rent controlled and includes utilities.

I've watched the prices for units in NoMa and Navy Yard (which is also what people generally include Capital Riverfront as part of) decline over the past few months because there are so many vacancies and it's really not a great deal once you include like $200-300+ extra costs for utilities and the $500 amenity fee etc.",12,2023,3,2,1,0

My partner moved to Navy Yard from NYC and IMO it’s not that there’s more crime here than NYC, but it feels more unpredictable and brazen. I’m not trying to scare you, there’s crime everywhere in DC so there will be something no matter where you end up. Just don’t be surprised when it happens. Be alert and you’ll be fine. 

The waterfront is a nice place to walk and hang out on a sunny day. A handful of good restaurants but otherwise mostly mediocre bars and eats that cater to the sports and concert crowd IMO. If you like concerts it’s awesome being able to walk to one at Nats Park. My overall view of Navy Yard is that a lot of the restaurants, bars, and apartment buildings are facades - they look fancy and brand new and alluring on the outside, but what you end up getting is a toss up. Mediocre food, shitty apartment construction, bad management. Some people disagree; to each their own. 

If you just want to experience a luxury apartment within your budget, north Arlington honestly sounds better - tons of parks and trails, close to the water, easy commute to GW on the orange line, lots of good little restaurants for takeout, and much safer.

If you’re working from home why live in the city? Could live a little further out and save money.

It’s also so dense there is no daylight in half the neighborhood. That said, it’s been developed so much there are benefits such as the restaurants and other amenities right there. 

DuPont is a funny suggestion I feel like that’s just if you want to live near bars, restaurants and small clubs and have FOMO. It’s also super crowded over there already. And in terms of the actual places to rent, they’re pretty underwhelming and old.",3,2023,3,2,1,0

Close to silver spring, easy access to NoMa and union station to take train out of city. Lots of new development and housing finally coming to market in and near the Parks at Walter Reed too.

DuPont can be affordable but there a fewer big apartment buildings, a lot more condos for rent. There are deals, just take work and luck to find. Living a bit farther out in Cleveland park might have some options and is more central.

Cons: very much a car zone to the point where they rarely yield to pedestrians and they do not respect you
Other things to note: very much a dog community (if you aren’t a dog person you might not like all the dogs around including the dog poo etc) and you will constantly have a big sports and bar scene atmosphere in the summer (if you aren’t a sports person or someone who can ignore big crowded streets it might not be for you), not a lot of parks/green areas (there are some and trails but they are more urbans than your traditional parks)

Or if you absolutely want to say you live in DC (which is perfectly fine too).  I have friends who moved here from NYC and thought VA to DC = Jersey to Manhattan. It's not the same, much closer and easier to cross the river overall. You can walk from Rosslyn to Georgetown in under a mile. There's some bridge traffic during rush hour but nowhere close to NYC. People shit on Arlington in the DC sub but in reality it can actually be more difficult to travel between certain neighborhoods in DC vs. from MD or VA depending on the location. Courthouse to Foggy Bottom is 8 mins on metro, 2 stops direct. Navy  Yard to Foggy Bottom is 22 mins on metro and you have to switch lines (and the DC metro is not like the NYC subway in terms of consistency). Personally would not want to commute to Foggy Bottom from H St NE or Columbia Heights. I agree that DC has more culture, I would move to DC proper in a heartbeat if I could afford the areas I like (and I've gotten accustomed to luxury buildings), but I still think Arlington has more character than Navy Yard. It's more established and there are actually small businesses and a sense of community in certain neighborhoods. Plus the county government is exceptionally well-run.",2,2023,3,2,1,0

jc521rw,11qqlj1,LadyHalfNHalf,"I lived on the terrace level in 1hundred and the communal bathroom routinely overflowed into the hall and into some units (not mine). This happened several times until I finally went directly to their corporate office and then they started locking the bathroom (apparently someone was putting stuff in the toilet to intentionally flood it?).

Locking the bathroom stopped the flooding but it was a whole mess trying to get them to care that sewage water was soaking the carpet once a week!

The apartments look nice, cabinets are very cheap and will peel. My heat was consistently broken and had to be put on emergency heat (it was a whole thing getting them to reimburse me for super high electric bills I received being on emergency heat).

Wi-Fi in the gym never worked and there was no cell service in there. Treads and elliptical were broken/in bad shape and never fixed despite multiple requests. 

Also, and this may not be an issue for you, but the construction and lack of natural light from all the tall buildings really got to me. My two big tips are 1. Get an apartment with natural light and 2. Don’t live near major construction (hard in DC!).

Also, living right next to the highway means all that air you breathe with be less than fresh. My patio table was caked in black dust one day after cleaning. 

That being said, I have a friend who has lived in 70 for 5+ years in different units and loves it. Also everyone I met there worked for the democrats, but then again I didn’t meet too many people bc it was still deep Covid!

I think if my friends lived in Navy Yard, I would have enjoyed it a lot more. It definitely has a city feel, just not that quintessential DC feel I think a lot of us enjoy. 

I was actually a little nervous to move to a true DC neighborhood which felt too different from what I was used to and Navy Yard felt more familiar (reminded me of Downtown Jersey city).

After a year, I was more familiar with the city and spots that I actually liked to hang out in, so I moved to NW near my friends and I’m much happier. The one thing I do miss is being able to walk to the mall and the water. That was super nice.

DDOT stands by the closure of the sidewalk because Park Van Ness's construction includes a parking garage that will exist underneath where the sidewalk is and thus providing support and structural integrity to the sidewalk. While under construction, because the garage wasn't there to completely support the weight of the sidewalk, the sidewalk had to close, or else would collapse under the weight of pedestrians.

These businesses were mostly corner stores and liquor stores, and had a reputation for charging high prices for low quality products. Even to this day if you go EOTR many if not most liquor stores, corner stores, and carryouts are owned and operated by Asian people.

2) Murdering people and using threats or violence to perpetuate a system of race based authority and rule.  Jim Crowe south from the end of the civil war until the 1970s.

3) Systemically denying a race of people civil rights and implementing second class citizenship supported by the government.  Same as #2, but arguably a significant issue up until the early 1990s and lingering to this day.

4) Individual cases of racist violence not supported by the govt.  2009 Charleston mass shooting.

hdyxttm,pteigg,XComThrowawayAcct,"*This is my entirely subjective analysis. YMMV.*

There have always been racists, white supremacists, and jerkwads who see “Black” as synonymous with “criminal,” “violent,” and “delinquent.” There are also lots of soft-racists who repeat these memes thoughtlessly.

An example: my own mom once repeated the theory to me that young Black people wear baggy pants because they get ill-fitting clothes as hand-me-downs from imprisoned relatives. I suggested that, instead, it could be that skateboarding and biking often require loose-fitting clothes and that this developed into an exaggerated style among youth in urban areas where those sports are most popular. It just hadn’t occurred to her to consider an explanation that wasn’t connected to criminality.

The Internet makes it possible to achieve efficiency in racist commentary we once only dreamed of! You don’t have to meet in person to share your off-color joke. It’s mostly anonymous so even if someone calls you out, no one will ever really know it’s you. And lastly, social media platforms like Reddit thrive on the accessibility. I can wander about posting whatever nonsense I want in any community I want. While this results in a lot of flexibility and creativity, racist white-supremacist jerkwads use this technological advantage to their benefit, too — just like their predecessors who used home printing systems to organize pamphlet campaigns.

I’m not going to suggest that sometimes their activities don’t truly become criminal terrorism that requires law enforcement to intervene. I do want to suggest that mostly it’s a free speech problem and that the best solution to *bad* speech is *more* speech.

I also want to say that, in my opinion, this is ultimately a test of community values. To win — to beat back that shitty community of bigots and their brood of thoughtless hangers-on — we have to build a better community, one that expressly and intentionally embraces values that are more constructive and more inclusive than theirs. It’s hard — community organizing always is — because it will involve lots of compromises, lots of questionable edge cases, lots of bad jokes and lukewarm takes, but if we are committed to the values — construction and inclusion — then we’ll stick to the path and achieve the goal, together.",4,2021,9,2,1,0

Our neighborhood has watched the general shenanigans and tomfoolery increase significantly over the past two years.

If it’s far right to say this is an issue for the city and its livability, then fine far right. But as someone who has only voted democratic it is a major quality of life issue and impediment to business. For me the biggest issue is the trend and not seeing clearly the policies and actions taken over the past 5 years have made it worse, if it doesn’t turn around it could be a crime-infested war zone, where right now it’s just a concerning trend that keeps getting closer and closer to home.

One of those safer cities includes Chicago, which TBF was always about average and only portrayed in the media as a war zone to smear Obama. I feel like most people choose to live in DC for other reasons knowing that, not deny reality. It really can happen anywhere except perhaps Palisades. If you value safety above all, move to New York, where you'll pay more to live in a more sterile gentrified area with $8 hot dogs. But it's not like the part of Queens or the Bronx you'll be able to afford for DC money is all that much safer than DC. It's not a warzone, it's not an especially dangerous or safe city, but you do have to be smart and be aware that there is a risk. Is that risk worth it, given how low your odds still are as long as you're not out in stupid places at stupid times of the night, and how incredibly boring zero-crime McLean is? I'd say so. And the few parts of NoVA that have parties and late night scenes (literally all 3 of them) have dicey areas too. Mt. Vernon or Manassas Park have shootings about as often as the Howard U area.",-2,2021,9,2,1,"1, 5"

I’ve lived in the District off and on for a few decades and while DC today isn’t Mogadishu of the mid 90s, the fact is that it reached its crime minimums a decade ago and as been on the upward trend since. 

DC in the late 80s through the late 90s was awful. It drastically improved through ~2012 / 2013 and now has spent the better part of a decade receding. 

This despite the fact that the bulk of the new population DC has attracted over the past two decades are wealthy, educated young folk. 

I would say that “traditional” crime hotspots like EOTR and NE have moderated, while areas like U street and Columbia Heights have gone full “battlefield”.

You can do a lot of political damage without ever flipping someone's vote. Tarnishing a candidate or a party can turn volunteers and donors into just voters. Increasing buy-in about primaries being rigged or ""both sides being the same"" can reduce the frequency that people vote. And, yes, there are still a good number of moderates who, in any election that doesn't involve Donald Trump, are open to voting across party lines.

These subtle shifts can also play out in the form of people posting less positive stuff (promoting democracy, civic duty, trust, etc.) and more negative content (apathy, divisiveness, etc.) on social media, which can contribute to more people in their network moving closer to these ideals OR can create discord and help isolate people from their longstanding peers due to growing political differences.",10,2021,9,2,1,0

The fact that you quoted the number of subscribers shows your misunderstanding. Lots of people can like a popular figure’s word salad, it doesn’t make what they have to say worthwhile. People eat up Deepak Chopra’s drivel, but it’s literally meaningless. Whereas very few people read and understand most of what’s published in PNAS, but those articles describe truths of the natural world. 

Much of what Peterson says is the same as Chopra’s bullshit, and people like you eat it up. Lobsters don’t have anything to do with human behavior, and what he says about lobsters is wrong anyway. He may have some expertise in clinical psychology (even that is dubious considering his former colleagues wouldn’t support tenure for him if they had known more about his views when he was under consideration). 

His conclusions about hierarchy, the role of women in society, transgender issues, are all without a basis in reality. 

If you like him because you need someone to tell you to clean your room, fine, but he’s not special in that regard. You can find a million self-help books that provide non-evidence based ways to get your life together. Hell, you can find a dom who will help you with that, and probably give you a more fulfilling relationship to boot. 

But to think that Peterson has any more than authority than the glorified self help charlatan he is is totally wrong.",2,2021,9,2,1,0

he40ozm,pteigg,MinecartHalp,"Everything you said boils down to “I’ve found a self-help book that works for me.”

That’s fine, I guess, but you can’t hold Peterson’s work out to be more than self help—and you absolutely shouldn’t take his ability to write a self help book as meaning that he has anything valuable to say about the rest of the world. I could say the same thing about Marie Kondo.  

Again, just because people buy into his bullshit, doesn’t mean it’s worthwhile or good for society. Think about Deepak Chopra. He was on the best seller list, and probably some people found a modicum of inner peace by visualizing their “quantum self”. Fine, good for them I guess. But there are larger harms associated with Chopra purveying pseudoscience bullshit. Some of these people will think that they can affect “quantum states” with their mind, some will forgo medical treatment for curable diseases. 

Peterson is the same. He dresses up his self-help as universal truths, which can be very dangerous if taken to their ultimate conclusion. It’s fine if all you use his advice for is helping you get your life together—many people use religion beneficially for the same purpose. But when you take it beyond self-help and use him to reinforce your own conservative (e.g. patriarchal) views, that’s unequivocally negative when these opinions conflict with reality. Given your other comments on crime and women, I’d say you fall into this category. 

This is exactly why Peterson’s oeuvre is terrible for society—it preys on people who would benefit from help (other self help books, therapy, a life coach), and reinforces their regressive societal views if they have them, or worse, generates them in someone who otherwise didn’t have them. 

>	Therein lies another problem with your argument: It's purely political.

You’re not using the word, “political”, correctly here. My argument is about truth and bullshit, not politics. (No doubt Peterson would vote for the CPs, and I’d vote NDP probably if I were Canadian, but this isn’t about *politics*, and these aren’t my *political* opinions.) This is about how Peterson misinforms, distorts, or lies about the reality of the human condition.

It seems like you’re placing great weight on his academic work and educational background. You’re naive to think that his academic credentials give him expertise on any issue outside of his immediate specialty. But he probably thinks it does, which is why much of what he says about the motivations of women or about social issues is absolute bullshit. You can’t seriously think that you’re experiencing his academic work when he tells you to clean your room. 

(Regarding McGill, Harvard, and UofT, I think everyone who’s gone to a top university/ivy understands that the students and professors are just as flawed as everyone else. I can recognize the legitimate contributions of these universities, while keeping in mind that they sometime produce bad results, as with the case of Peterson or Dershowitz.)

If you want a thorough dissection of Peterson’s bullshit, this is a good start, though I doubt you’ll read it. https://merionwest.com/2019/12/10/standing-by-our-criticisms-of-jordan-peterson/


>	You can make these weak attempts to delegitimize his career and work. None of that matters. At the end of the day, he's helping millions of people improve their lives while you wallow away miserably possessed by a radical political ideology.

See, it does matter because people will be influenced by him beyond his trite self-help points and tricked into believing false things about the world, society, and human nature. You may be a good example of this if you can’t see him for what he is. Try picking up a self-help book that’s a little less “political”. (Sarcasm by the way.)

Separately, the amount of effort you’ve put into this conversation sure seems like you’re trying to prove something to yourself. Again, it’s okay if you find Peterson’s bland truisms helpful, but don’t shy away from larger criticisms of his “philosophy”.",3,2021,9,2,1,0
he4wof2,pteigg,MinecartHalp,"I’m sad that your dismal reading comprehension and argumentation skills are making this so hard for you. 

I mentioned political parties to show this wasn’t about politics. Not hypocrisy, just something you missed. 

I don’t think I can provide any more examples that will get you to understand that someone’s popularity does not equate to their value. Similarly, I can’t make you understand that his academic credentials aren’t evidence for the truth (or even coherence) of his statements. (Has he ever given you a definition of post modern neo Marxism? No. It’s just a boogeyman.)

Finally, I’d encourage you to reconsider your understanding of and relationship to “politics” and “political ideology”. We’re not discussing politics here (and I don’t think Peterson discusses politics much at all). This has nothing to do with politics or a political ideology, and your incorrect use of those terms to dismiss me is unfortunate. If you think that every person who see the world as is it and wants to change it to make it a better place is engaged in (dirty) politics, that’s a sad way to live.

I’m in Glover Park now, and 99% of the homeless people here are just kind of a passive presence doing their own thing.

I saw a guy walking up Connecticut, north of DuPont, threatening to hit people if they didn't give him money, including women. Total predator. Thankfully, less than half a block down was a cop in a car, I waived him down and told him and he actually went after the guy. Better reactivity than  I have heard elsewhere here. To some degree, though, again, you're gonna be the most responsible for your safety in the end, and if you have pepper spray--I encourage you to let-er-rip if a situation like your 2nd one occurs again. Your first situation, most striking to me is how that guy didn't help at all--really unfortunate. But if someone is trying to stab you--fork or whatever--defend yourself to your utmost with upper spray or otherwise.",15,2024,9,2,1,"1, 5"

Cross the street if you have to to avoid them and don’t feel ashamed.

Don’t speak to those people, don’t make eye contact, don’t go anywhere near someone while they’re having a psychotic episode. This has always been the golden rule from multiple psychiatrists in my family and it’s proven true, having growing up in 1990s NYC.

lp3l0xj,1fpo3o7,under_psychoanalyzer,"Take people who are obviously have paranoid delusionals off the streets. I don't actually know why its worse in DC than a lot of other US cities. I'm not a expert on vulnerable communities. Like yes we let juveniles go a lot. Part of it could be that we actually do what is *supposed* to be good in terms of public housing, and we dont put it all in one area. Even though EOTR is certainly higher in certain crime, Adams morgan, foggy bottom, etc. all have public housing where as other cities administration would just building public housing EOTR happily segregating it.


The US in general has a very large problem where we simply don't have mental aslyums anymore. We ran them very poorly until we stopped having them altogether around the time of Nixon IIRC. Bush also cut of a bunch of funding IIRC because at some point in the 2000s if you tried to commit suicide it went from actual inpatient psychiatric care in hospitals to being handcuffed to a bed for 72 hours then kicked to the curb. That's the same place funding for these people on the streets would come from. Then on top of that the ACLU argued a case that set a precedent that makes it *incredibly* difficult to commit someone without their own or their families consent. So across all of America, if someone needs to be taken off the street because they're having a mental psych episode, if they dont want to go, the only option is jail. 


In DC this is probably, as a guess, not an expert, compounded because we don't have a place to put even people doing criminal acts. One of the perks of no statehood is we don't even have much of a jail. Like think about if we actually arrested every person walking around the city right now obviously out of their mind and who has threatened somebody recently? We don't have the resources to process, hold, and transport all those people. 


With all fentanyl and all the other crazy shit going on this country needs to get over its aversion to long term psychiatric holds. But Republicans don't want to pay for ""freeloaders"" and Democrats dont want to ""marginalize"" already downtrodden people, even if long term care is literally someone's only hope. 


If it had an easy solution we'd do it. But the answer like a lot of DC problems is: we're not a state and we're afraid to jail people, even though the latter happened as a result of good intentions we swung the pendulum too far imho. But what the fuck do I know.",10,2024,9,2,1,

I agree that Atlanta has lost its southern hospitality years ago after so many transplants moved here. People are still nice though… until they get in their cars and they are downright nasty. I laugh at dmv drivers when I’m there bc Atlanta drivers are so much worse in many ways. When I moved to Atlanta, a southern woman gave me her bed after she found out that I had nowhere to stay that night. Can’t get more kind and trusting than that, but that was 30 years ago. People are not that way anymore in many areas all over the US. I still do think people are more warm in Atlanta though in general. 

In DC metro, there are so many people who are mostly there for government work, like lobbyists, politicians, politician’s interns, diplomats, attorneys, etc and they don’t feel a sense of wanting to belong the way true residents do. My mom had a lobbyist neighbor and he was one of the nastiest people I’ve ever met. Her other neighbor worked for the World Bank and while they were nice, they kept to themselves and their Bangladeshi friends. Also in the 20ish years I lived in dc metro, I don’t recall anyone randomly being friendly as I walked down the street. When I moved to Atlanta and people started saying hi and waving, I was immediately suspicious and grumpy, at first thinking they weren’t greeting me and then “what do they want from me?”  because even though I knew people in my MD neighborhood, no one ever said hi. We definitely didn’t know anyone in my grandparents neighborhood even though they lived there for 30-40 years. And no one ever said hi in the district when walking down the street that I recall. People were usually busy rushing doing whatever they doing. 

I am happy that you are enjoying the DMV though, considering I love it there and miss it a lot. I’ve thought about moving back so many times, but the cost of buying a house and other living expenses there is so much more expensive than it is in Atlanta. DC has so much more going for it, although Atlanta metro is more livable from my pov. I know Atlanta is catching up in terms of cost of living but I still think it’s cheaper here overall, even living in the city. I also miss the intelligence and culture of the people in DC metro.

htjh7lc,s8cihs,classicalL,"So you are mostly spot on in my opinion. I'm a native but I have lived elsewhere. Frankly LA driving style is far worse than the constant complaints about MD drivers by the region...

WMATA is great, second honestly only to living in NYC (which I have done). LA, Boston, Chicago, SF. I've uses these systems (not MARTA though), and DC's transport system is better than pretty much all of those. Maybe SF is close, NYC is better. Right now though it is very empty so. Hopefully that will change. But right now the headways are bad. In the 90s and 00s WMATA was AMAZING. It turned out that was deferring tons of maintenance. But they ran trains to super late with low headways and nothing was broken. We are paying for those days now. Nevertheless it is still a really good system. Go to Europe and have the transit workers all go on strike. The union has problems and the org needs to fix some structural problems but it will get better. If gas prices go up enough ridership will return if people either get used to COVID or it dies back.

DC is largely gentrified out. That's a very different feel than it was in the 90s. Some old timers don't like that, but the city is on the whole a lot safer and cleaner than it was in NE in particular but also near the waterfront.

DC has so many cultural things and many of them free, it spoils you. Again if COVID would just get a lid on things even more stuff about the city would come back and be enjoyed. The region is ridiculously educated. Amazon didn't site HQ2 here just for money reasons... I honestly thing DC was hitting a critical size where it would grow from regional demand rather than just Fed money. 

DC feels more like a city than LA does honestly but less like a city sometimes than even Baltimore because it doesn't have that high rise center that so many cities have with the taller buildings near Union Station or in VA. Hopefully any zoning will be removed and we can have the stuff behind Union Station get really tall and it will feel like that is the city center. I don't know. Berlin has a pretty low rise spread out feel also but it is way dirtier and gritter like parts of NYC and not the good ones.

I guess I have gone on my own tangent but DC's region is one of the best in the country and the best for certain specific things. People are far to enamored with the west coast cities which honestly aren't that interesting for the most part.",2,2022,1,2,1,

Perhaps phrasing it as, ‘a suburb of DC’ may be accepted a little better? As someone who lived in DC for 7 years, it’s almost a knee jerk reaction to correct people who claimed they lived in DC but then really didn’t lol. We’re super prideful!! 

If/when DC goes back to normal, traffic will become horrific and so will the metro 😭. Metro is much more expensive than Marta but is way more useful - I used to live in Brookhaven and the only reason why I used Marta was to get to the airport. 

Some advice - when using the metro escalators, left side of the step = walking side & right side = standing side! Don’t ever stand on the left side of escalator steps, even when it isn’t packed. Everyone’s in a rush & you will probably get run over. Lastly, when waiting for a train, I suggest waiting for it closer to the beginning at the train - the middle and end get extremely crowded!!",-1,2022,1,2,1,

I lived in Atlanta for 12 years and never, ever had people do the downright weird things they'll do here, going out of their way to avoid interacting with me or even having to acknowledge my presence. In both apartments I've lived in and both buildings I've worked in here, I've had people literally stare at the floor, the wall or the ceiling as they walk by me in a hallway, to avoid looking at me or having to say any sort of hello. This has happened at least a dozen times, with different people in different placesso I know I'm not imagining it. 

People will either rush to get into their apartment and shut the door if they see you coming, or if they're halfway out the door, will go back inside and shut the door until you pass. This behavior was all happening pre-Covid so I can't blame it on that.

I've said ""Hello"" to people when we passed by a foot from each other on the sidewalk in a residential area and had them just look at me like I was a tree or a car and not say a word. I'd say there's a 50/50 chance of that happening vs getting a response.",27,2022,1,2,1,

I thought of Atlanta because it's close to family, but I don't like the lower salaries, crime, or traffic. I've had the same weird experiences as you in apartment complexes too. One day I was just chillin at the mailbox on a bluetooth call. There was this one lady who I sorta liked, but never got to talk to that was my neighbor. She just sat there waiting for me to get out, like she wanted me to go first so she didn't have to say anything to me. It was weird.

I've noticed dating is hard too there in that in Atlanta it seemed like people only talk to groups of people that they grew up with. The cost of living worries me with DC though. Some of the suburbs of Atlanta like Alpharetta, Sandy Springs, and Roswell have homes that are 600k+, which don't make sense considering most jobs only pay 40 to 60k.

Agreed about the Beltline! It will be wonderful when that's completed. Unincorporated DeKalb County is awful for sidewalks IMHO, though, while unincorporated Montgomery County has trails connecting cul-de-sacs in remote parts of the county per Google Maps. Holy shit.

Tbh DC IMHO beats the Buford Highway because so many different avenues are like it. Check out Honduran eats on Huntington Avenue, Vietnamese on Wilson/Clarendon, Ethiopian on Georgia Avenue, Salvadoran on Columbia Pike and Baltimore Avenue, if you haven't already. Peruvian of course, everywhere, plus Iranian. Buford Highway was good but there is so much inexpensive international food everywhere here. I get ehhh pupusas for $3 in my home burb in Cincinnati and amazing carefully prepared ones here for $2 in College Park or Arlington. Idk, just stating this if you haven't explored the hole in the wall food scene. Oh I forgot about Colombian food in Silver Spring (Arepas Pues).

Lol, I think we have opposite feelings about weather. It beats Philly (less cold/windy/super rainy) and Atlanta (skull slapping humidity, thunderstorms, and frequent power outages). Frankly even Cincy and Cincinnati weather is pretty reasonable. The summer was nowhere near as miserable as Atlanta and the winter is not like Philly or even Cincinnati, where it can reach 0°F with no humidity. Nose bleed time lol. Philly I think is the worst because it's hot and humid or cold, rainy, humid, and windy. Here gets hot and cold but I don't have rain flying into my bones through three layers like Philly.

* Alexandria housed the largest human trafficking (slave-trading) company in the US. A major factor in retrocession of DC land to VA was to try to protect this slave trade from a potential abolitionist majority in Congress, which could end slavery in DC.

jwady54,15qu0ac,,"My answer to 4 is that D.C. is actually pretty terrible at producing public space to *dwell*, for hours. Users often (correctly) praise the city’s walkability, but we don’t tend to converse about that other crucial part of any urban environment: the ability to dwell. Every time people bring up the urbanist wet-dream cities like Barcelona, they tend to talk about walkability, commerce, sustainability, etc. All of these are important, but one crucial aspect missed is that Barcelona, Madrid, Amsterdam, etc, have different *spatial imperatives*. Put simply, there’s a difference in what a body is obliged to do. 

In Washington, D.C., a body is obliged to walk, but only walk. Parks are pretty far apart, and many don’t offer much beyond the ability to sit on a hard bench that may or may not have a curved back to prevent napping (yay, anti-homeless architecture). The action, for example, of stopping and chilling on a certain sidewalk will earn you some dirty looks and maybe some dirty words. Most of this city is a sidewalk. This never became more apparent than when I had to walk with my elderly father to the Optometrist’s. He could obviously have benefited from a place to chill at certain points, but even those terrible benches are not so populated within the city. I’ve seen many people sit on those sidewalk-level window sills of stores, just to catch a break from the incessant movement our design commands. Watch one 4K walking tour of these European cities that we want to emulate: they just congregate wherever the fuck they want. It’s seen as normal to just stand, to lean on things, to exist as you feel comfortable. They don’t need a designated space. Hell, we need that designated space more than the Europeans, and we don’t even have as many! We don’t have those wonderful, directionless squares/piazzas they do. 

There will probably be some able-bodied, young to middle-aged Redditors that contest what I’m saying, but as the great sociologist Richard Sennett says, most cities aren’t built for seniors. Really, you could expand that and say most American cities aren’t built for anyone outside of a particularly envisioned urban subject, one who is either physically indefatigable, or a driver.",1,2023,8,2,1,

My father, a machinist-turned-electrical-engineer, spent his career at metro developing these signs.  I remember dinner table conversations about realtime computing and how to reconcile the train schedule with actuaI location readings.  And how to do it all within the constraints of legacy hardware with limited memory and bitrates.  I remember his consideration on displaying train length on the board.  Or whether reclaiming some space with an abbreviation would create confusion.  I remember when he took me to see the sign prototypes in the lab several levels below ground in the Jackson building.  And when he started to get sick, pushing him to work in his wheelchair to that same basement.  He described working for metro as passion, not a job.  I'm reminded of that passion every time I wait for the train and see one of these signs.  Eight months into the quarantine and i suppse that's been a while.  So seeing yours hit me like an emotional ton of bricks.

For now, if you’re interested in getting started with Home Assistant, here’s how I did the WMATA integration:

1.	I used Node-RED to handle the WMATA API requests. There was a lot response parsing with the WMATA API, so Node-RED made it easier to manipulate the payloads.
2.	Node-RED, after parsing the API responses, creates a sensor in Home Assistant - one for each station/track combo based on the stations monitored in the Node-RED flow.
3.	The sensor contains attributes for the response values, as well as a formatted HTML attribute for use in the Home Assistant front-end.
4.	I’m using Home Assistant custom secondary-info card to display the formatted HTML below the sensor value.

jwblfoo,15rvy1v,harkuponthegay,"Those two viewpoints aren’t incompatible though— I’d argue that most of the “car < bike” people are motivated primarily by environmental concerns. The same goes for the anti suburban stance— it is a poor use of space to spread people out that way when they could be concentrated closer to the places they work. Again, environmental. 

On the other hand the “crime is a reality of city living” view is not environmentally motivated at all— that perspective is socioeconomically motivated (and often race plays a role as well). 

The belief there is generally that crime is an artifact of poverty, lack of opportunity, community conflict, and the trauma of institutional racism which are disproportionately experienced by poor and minority populations. In this sense it is seen as a social injustice to “eradicate crime” from the city because in order to do so one would either have to:

- eliminate poverty
- remove the poor  

And generally the latter ends up being easier to accomplish than the former (and more widely supported by the folks that feel that poor people deserve to be punished; or those that simply don’t want to acknowledge their existence).

Which leads to some unfortunate outcomes.

It’s not all about environmentalism, though.

It’s important to note that advocates for urban living and alternative modes of transport (besides just cars) see great value in the fiscal efficency that is gained from increased density. The idea is to build a society where there is enough cash in the coffers to offer robust social programs to abate tendencies towards socioeconomically motivated crime *and* the city budget actually balances out. 

This is because it’s insanely expensive to offer city amenities to near-rural population densities, and these expenses sap a great deal of money from tax revenue which is mostly generated in urban areas. Combine that with the fact that it’s expensive and time consuming for an individual to get anywhere with the costly car that’s required to exist and it’s a lose-lose situation. Society and the individual are fiscally worse off.

The problem I have with just “throw them in jail” is that doesn’t rehabilitate them! As it relates to argument (a) they do have PLENTY of opportunity but you do know how intellectually disability/lack of education  creates low self confidence. Self-efficacy is needed to get and keep a job. To learn, to Adapt, and have other skills necessary for all job stability. It’s non empathic to just say, people don’t want to work; they might have mental barriers to getting and/or keeping a job; (2) likely those who are worse off, have strong family support. Think about it, tons of folks live with their supportive parents until they find a job, save for a house, and move out. Heck, now, even folks who get degrees often have to move back home. Not everyone has that family support. Let’s be real. 

Ah, yes, you could give these some folks free money. They’d blow it because their morals/values align with materialism. Often, those folks don’t realize they have low self-confidence and buy expensive things as a proxy for self-worth. Social media has heightened folks lack of self confidence with ignorant folks liking someone wearing designers clothes; when in reality, people should be saying, “why do you value designer clothes more than education, charity for others, and/or your relationships?

Stats point to young black men committing and simultaneously being victims of a majority of the violent crime in DC. 

There was a study published earlier this year and posted on another thread then:

Reporters tend to get pulled into cycles of ""this is big right now, so I'm writing about it or covering it, wow I'm reading a lot about this right now it must be big, I should be covering it,"" etc etc. Reporters are humans and should be less susceptible to covering the shiny thing, but aren't always. 

But! That doesn't mean it's not happening either. If I were a local DC reporter (which I'm not), I'd look at data over time. How many teens committed violent crimes each year since, let's say, 1990? How many teens committed violent crimes in similar-sized cities (or using other comparable variables) this year, or in years past? A big one: *who* are the most likely victims of these types of crimes (for example: Are other teens the victims? Are people who live in a certain ZIP more likely to be the victims? Etc.)? Is this a pandemic problem, or just exacerbated by the pandemic, or completely unrelated to the pandemic?

Plus general trust in institutions is real bad now, so nobody is proactively snitching like they maybe did in the past.

When we wanted to screw around we also could go to a field or somebody’s abandoned trailer or an empty parking lot. Where do DC kids go to blow off steam in relative isolation? We don’t have a lot of public places for them, malls/stores/food halls are pretty surveilled and require money, and we don’t really have a ton of parks outside of NW.

First off, the ""courtroom"" operates just like with adults, except the sentence upon conviction is ""services."" ""Services"" include probation, meetings with counselors, enforced compliance with IEPs  (specialized educational programs for kids who can't function in a normal classroom). In egregious cases like this, unless they're charged as an adult, they're not getting ""locked up,"" at most, they'll go to a camp for a year or so, focused on rehabilitation

Think about that for a second. Services are a penalty to be enforced after ""conviction"".

So then you have public defenders fighting to get the kids off applying the same notion of due process, proof beyond a reasonable doubt, preservation of liberty etc. that we do in adult cases. Except no one's going to jail or paying fines. They're receiving treatment. And we deprive kids of their liberties for their own good all the time, (e.g., mandatory school attendance)

So imagine you're this victim. Possible outcomes are 1) Public defender is successful, nothing happens 2) Kid is ""convicted"" (it's not called that)  and maybe he gets ""services,"" and at most, he goes away to a facility for a year.

Particularly in this era, it is incredibly difficult to parent kids when the phone and internet is overwhelmingly controlling all of society. I am super strict at home, as are my friends, and yet.....the crap they see on the internet is terrifying and normalized. 3.) The amount of mentally ill people out there is huge and there are virtually zero resources. Therapists and psychiatrists are at least a 12 month waiting list, sometimes 18 months. Parents who were abused and might be battling addictions or have other bad coping skills cannot break free without help. Then their kids enter the same vicious circle.  CPTSD requires years and years of intense therapy and appx. zero people in society are willing to get that for all the poor and homeless that require it. 4.) There are kids out there with bipolar, ADHD, ASD, schizophrenia, et al and they cannot get help - no matter how hard the parents try. Schools just do not care at all.

Teen pregnancy is at its lowest ever. In fact, even adult women are radically reducing the number of children they have, if they have them at all. As in Europe, in order to prop up Social Security, countries have to increase immigration.

I work with youth and I'm shocked how none of the young women have an interest in having kids. In fact, there are studies that show young people are having less sex than ever!

Recall all those high-school brawls and not once did anyone do anything correctly. You don’t need stamina, this isn’t a  30 minute sporting event. Street defense is about full power against an untrained, over-confident opponent harming you or another community member. 

That being said, people trained in self-defense/combat sports should not go around pounding on juveniles. Juveniles also may carry weapons. Even an untrained knife opponent will likely get a few thrusts in before they are incapacitated. 

Law enforcement is not there to stop crime in action, that is a myth. That is the job of civil society and a sense of community.

An in shape 35 year old, who knows what the fuck they're doing, is way better than an 18 year old for experience in using their body and muscle mass (again, everything being individual). 

Anyway weird argument, lol. But yes, if you don't feel comfortable intervening if you think there might be, or already is, violence...don't. But a 35 year old won't shatter like glass against an 18 year old. The only thing I'd say is most of these 13 year olds probably have more experience in fighting than the average guy and people who have no clue wtf they're doing could get rocked by one kid who knows how to hit. Shrug.

And the real issue is numbers, intervening by yourself against a group is dangerous. Pretty much no one is going to be able to fight 6+ kids, even fucking 13 year olds, without getting beat a bit or worse. That's why intervening doesn't have to mean violence but intervening in violence could still help someone, more people might come (depending on circumstances) egged on by your intervention (don't count on it but it happens) and more importantly it might stop the other attack against someone much less able to do shit about it and make the kids more likely to gtfo of dodge.

It's not preposterous that everyone around that area is masked up, and you would know this if you commute there. 

At the end of the day masking has nothing to do with being liberal or conservative, it's about protecting your hygiene. Mask wearing is prominent in Asian countries for this reason. If you want to be maskless outside where people can freely move that's fine, but in a tightly enclosed space like the metro I believe wearing a mask is the decent thing to do. It's also the absolute bare minimum -- I'm not even saying everyone needs to be vaccinated or boosted.

I'm not a cynic, and I believe people can change. If you're one of those who think masks can't mitigate the spread of covid, studies indicate the opposite. [The CDC states that cloth masks can block over 80% of fine particles and droplets.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/science-briefs/masking-science-sars-cov2.html) There is also a list of several other studies on this page backing the efficacy of masks.

It was commensurate with the total amount of leave provided to coworkers who had sick leave separate and was considered (by me at least) as an advantage to have this flexibility. This classification is made for positions with greater responsibilities, some of which are going to accrue while you are away and be your responsibility when you return from illness or vacation.

lkag15z,1f2viug,DC_MOTO,"I lived in admo for 20 years.

In 2004 the neighborhood was THE going out scene, 18th Street would be so crowded that vehicles the road would be clogged with pedestrian traffic.   At last call it was pandemonium.  In the summer muggings of drunk people was a daily occurrence.  

That year an officer was shot pursuing a criminal.  After that there were large amounts of police, at least 20 officers on the street at night on the weekends.   That continued but gradually lessened until COVID... then BLM.

It is shocking to me that during drinking hours there are not more officers out.  

The police nationwide have changed their approach to policing post BLM.  In my humble opinion police are not paid by the arrest, and I think DC metro decided that they are going to not try as hard to arrest and detain suspects, as well as simply not put themselves in harms way.  Why?  because they don't have to - they get paid regardless. 

Every time and officer tries to arrest someone several of those outcomes result in the officer being fired, suspended, killed, or hurt. Only one is good, the suspect surrenders peacefully, and as I said before they aren't being paid a bonus for that.  

You have to really consider what that job is like and how you as a taxpayer and a citizen want them to do their jobs.

Additionally, police should be educated on the law (at least criminal) in a similar manner to law school and undergo deescalation and social service training. Take that 9-18 month police training and and turn it into 2.5 years imo.

Anyways, I do think *some* cops are good and deserve positive recognition. And those cops absolutely do risk their lives if they’re actually doing their jobs. 

Whether it’s traffic management (a Maryland driver could strike at any time), riot control (the ones that defended the Capital from Jan. 6th traitors not the ones that let them in), gang investigation (undercovers could be killed if discovered - we **know** it’s gangs bringing fent into our communities), confronting someone with unlawful use of a gun, saving someone from an abuser, or even some simple traffic stops, the *good* police officers are entering a situation that other professions may lack - an unpredictable and frequently unaccountable variable - other humans.

I’m not going to post clips as proof (they’re on the internet if you’re so desperate to see for yourself), but believe me when I say I have seen bodycam footage of officers responding to situations that should be otherwise safe and peaceful only for the person they are interacting with to suddenly stab or shoot them.

With jobs in agriculture and - to a lesser degree - small engine mechanics, many of the the factors which are dangerous *are* predictable and should be properly accounted for if the job is being performed correctly - many deaths can be avoided by simply paying attention. When you interact with other humans you just have no way of truly knowing how they will react and what their plan is. 

Underwater welders, electrical linesman, and oil-rig workers, however, can prep and account for all they want and they will still frequently die. THOSE are jobs that really truly risk their lives on a day-to-day basis.

Anyways please don’t call me a bootlicker, that’ll hurt my feelings, just trying to offer up another way of looking at it but please understand that I also believe that our country’s current police systems 100% need to be overhauled lol.",2,2024,8,2,1,

Mount Pleasant has a larger population and has greater connection to the rest of the city (it really bleeds into Columbia Heights and Petworth) so it will attract more crime. But really MP is more suburban than most parts of the district; more so than Cleveland Park/TenleyTown which is more gated diplomatic mansions flanked by apartments.  MP is poorer and more diverse, and with that comes more crime, but it also has a stronger community spirit that makes most people I know who live there feel safer than the coldness and isolation of some of DC’s western suburbs.

Cleveland Park is safer mostly because it is in the middle of nowhere with little accessibility, and there is practically no nightlife to speak of. For many people this isn’t a drawback. If you are looking for someplace that is simply safer, it’s a better pick. But aside from some nice restaurants and a (really!) great Italian deli, there is not much of a draw to the area.

If you only trying to play in AdMo Cleveland Park is nice, but there are safe, similar communities closer to the city.

Cleveland Park is up a hill, making biking no easy feat.  The red line practically doesn’t work outside of peak times, and traffic is hectic if not unbearable during certain periods, making bussing and driving difficult.

I have heard the DC police encourage people to report things like this. Call the non-emergency number.

Within 3 minutes he had gotten my number and kissed me on the head - I immediately walked away unsettled that I let a stranger touch me on the streets - it all just happened so fast. My instincts were that something was off, but after 3 ignored texts from him I finally answered and agreed to meet up for coffee the following week. He kept insisting I meet him at 1500 Mass Ave and ignored my suggestions for other places. I decided to attempt some internet research with only his first name and phone number and found a limited social media presence that my gut found strange so I decided to bail at the last minute claiming a work meeting came up. He immediately got aggressive over text message, “You’re a fucking loser. You’re not worth my time or my dick.” I promptly blocked him knowing I had made the right call not to meet up with him and my womens intuition was spot on.

Then he said he just moved here from NYC and was looking for good coffee and to meet new people and asked if I wanted to get a cup of coffee with him. I said no that I needed to be somewhere else. He started asking if I lived in the area, where did I work. I was stuck at a crosswalk and had to wait for the light to change in order to get away. He could tell I was uncomfortable and pointed out my wedding ring and said he wasn't trying to hit on me. Then pressured me into giving him my phone number so that we could meet up. I ended up giving it to him (stupid I know) just to get him to leave me alone. I then quickly walked away. He texted me a few times asking to meet up but I never responded. Then about a month ago a man stopped me to ask for directions to a good coffee shop. I was distracted and started giving him directions before realizing it was the same guy. He began asking me to get coffee with him. I said no and quickly walked away. Again this was on 13th and L

ijggijx,o930zn,smwarner17,"I had the same experience with him three times too!!! As recently as last week. The first time I fell for it and things got very creepy.

  
One day this man and I walked past each other and he asked if there was a good Mexican restaurant nearby. We got to talking, he seemed super normal/respectful/cute and we exchanged numbers. He hugged me goodbye and kissed me on the cheek.

  
He asked me out for a midday walk date the next day. On the walk, he spoke almost entirely in sexual innuendos, said that my dress would be sexy if it flew up and proceeded to lift it up in the back on a very populated street. He ended our walk outside his apartment. He kept talking about different entrances to get in. I went to leave, and he pulled me in to kiss me. I turned and said “not on a first date” and he proceeded to kiss my neck — also on a very public street.

  
He texted later and said I had been a tease. I disengaged, but he kept texting me sexual things for a week. I finally lied and said I was seeing someone. He texted “I don’t give a fuck if you’re seeing someone, NYC girls say I’m the best pussy eater.”

  
Months later, we crossed paths in DC (I had sunglasses on, he didn’t recognize me). He asked “Hey, do you know if this building is really part of XX school?”, I pretended not to hear him. But he shouted, “ma’am? Excuse me?”

  
Last week, I was in another part of DC and we crossed paths (sunglasses again) & he said “hey, do you know the best place to buy wine around here?”",8,2022,8,2,1,

That's not how it works and your perspective is seriously warped. A woman grabbed by a strange man on the street is a victim of a crime in the moment she was touched without consent, not only after she's raised an objection. What if raising an objection made her attacker angry when he's already got her unable to get away? It's a crime when you grab someone against their will, it isn't a hard concept.

I hate the humidity here. It is my least favorite thing about DC. But it is in part balanced out by long a long and gorgeous spring! I grew up near Chicago where spring always seemed to be 2 weeks long. But here it’s like 3 months of really nice weather before the heat and humidity really hits. The winters are mild, and fall is also gorgeous. It all beats (or at least balances) out the gross July and August. 

Here is what else beats the humidity: it is a gorgeous city. It’s beautiful. I will never get tired of walking around. The city has so much going on but it’s compact. I can either metro or bike anywhere in like 30 minutes. I can metro to the airport in 40 minutes. People are always outside. There is a lot of green space and people use it.

* People on this sub like to tout how walkable/public transport friendly this city is. True, sometimes. But metro stops running super early. Where I live, it'd take me 45+ min to get to Union Station, despite being a 15 min drive. I went to Baltimore for an Oriole's game today - about an hour drive, Transit app estimated 2:25 hours with public transit.

* lack of convenience store/bodega culture. Yeah, there are a few places to grab a snack late-night. But a 15-20min walk each way is not convenient. In NYC, I can go ten steps any direction and find a bodega.

* alcohol laws are stupid as hell. You can't buy beer in gas stations/7-eleven... ok, fine. But not being able to buy a six-pack of beer on a Friday night after midnight is ridiculous.

* Lack of an artistic/creative subculture. Everyone got priced out and moved to Baltimore. Yeah, you can find indie or DIY shows here and there, but only if you actively seek it out and go to the one single place that is hosting something on a Friday night. I wish I could just pop into my neighborhood bar and experience a less square culture. I don't mean to sound like an asshole, but it seems to me that DC is generally much more of a straight-laced, squeeky-clean personality type town than any other city. A lot of my friends come from middle of nowhere Midwest.. Obviously this city is gonna seem incredible compared to that; but there is nothing artsy, punk, or rebellious readily available here, even if some people say there is

* food sucks. There's a lot of good restaurants apparently - I don't know, I can't afford to go to them. There is a SEVERE lack of cheap eats/street food here. The halal place by my house in Columbia Heights charges over $15 for a chicken over rice platter. That's fucking insane!!!! Even with prices going up in NY, I still have never paid more than $8 for the same shit that tastes better and has more food

* Niche, but its too flat and the weather sucks. I want snow in the winter. I want to snowboard in the winter. Closest option? 4 hours to a shit hill in PA or WV. I'm admittedly salty here, but I wish I had more readily accessible cold climates/mountains here.

*No dive bars, no Irish pubs, no neighborhood haunts. Yeah, there are some, but it's just not the same here.


Pros:
* lots of space. More greenery. An average block here is much more open, spacious, and breathable than a random block in Brooklyn. 

* Interesting people - not to contradict myself earlier, but there is something about a city of transplants. I've learned more about the rest of the country than I ever have otherwise since I moved here. I find that amazing. There are also generally a lot of opportunities to experience a different culture here - I didn't know what Malort was before I moved here, but I could go with some midwest friends to Ivy and Coney and get a small taste of their regional culture.

Bought 2 boxes tissues, 1 pack of floss picks, 1 container of vaseline, (1) am/pm combo pack of store brand cold/flu syrup, and (1) container of contact solution. Total came to $60.....$60 fucking dollars for less than a bag full of basic items.

the name brand Dayquil am/pm cold and flu was $40 alone....seriously. 

I completely understand why people are robbing these places and reselling, the corporation is straight up robbing consumers. Its criminal profiteering imo, my entire order shouldn't have cost more than $25 tops and wouldn't have a few years ago. I made the decision just to stop going to CVS now, i'll get what I need online, or shop around different grocery stores.

I suspect that number is inflated and/or represents total lost products due to shoplifting or other factors (such as accidental damage, etc.). CVS has an incentive to inflate that number to make the problem look worse in order to pressure local governments to subsidize their security. If you think otherwise feel free to check the annual report.

CVS has been penalized over $100 million for wage theft violations over the past 20 years and studies show wage theft is typically recovered at a rate of around 1-2%.  So that works out to $250M - $500M annually. And that’s probably a conservative estimate.

Wage theft is so commonplace and employees are so powerless to fight it, that we often don’t even notice when it happens.  

The “your shift starts at 9 so show up 20 minutes early to make sure you are ready for your shift” attitude is so common that most people don’t recognize that it’s illegal to not pay employees for that 20 minutes.

Note that Dugan was specifically referring to organized retail crime, or ""professional shoplifters,"" and was excluding all the casual shoplifters who operate independently.  Dugan did not specify how much the casual shoplifters steal in a typical year.  Dugan also did not provide a figure for losses attributable to theft by CVS employees, but that's likely a large number as well.  See, for example:

(1) multiple arrests in DC

(2) an MPD SUV driving up behind a sedan with lights blazing, multiple cops jumping out with weapons and detaining all 4 occupants of the vehicle on the sidewalk

(3) MPD personnel kill someone just outside my apartment at night (I was asleep and did not witness, but could look out my apt window and see the spot a hundred feet away) - https://www.npr.org/local/305/2021/08/27/1031669151/d-c-police-release-footage-following-their-fatal-shooting-of-antwan-gilmore

Law enforcement has been alive and well here since the BLM protests. Traffic enforcement is a double-edged sword in DC because it’s very easy for more harm to come from a chase. Cops have to choose their battles too.

We do need better ticket enforcement for VA and MD drivers who drive here with no regard for safety. That’s a political/state issue though. We also need better technology for tracking stolen cars, or just to do a better job of discouraging driving in DC.

As far as metro jumpers, it’s likely not cost-effective to have police at every metro gate every day. A person jumping is a few dollars lost income. WMATA is now installing new fare gates which can’t be jumped though; you can see them at some stations.

Wage theft is likely the greater wrong in this case in pure dollar amount terms, for the reasons I’ve stated. But it’s also the greater moral wrong because the victim is a real person rather than corporate profits.

And if CVS closes stores in your area, blame CVS, not the thieves. CVS could choose to put people over profit and take measures to keep those stores open (or rather we could write laws that allow CVS to do that), but they don’t.

You can’t have a pharmacy with items to purchase because CVS has decided it’s not profitable to provide that. They’d rather force you to pay for their security.

The reason I harp on wage theft is because I think it matters which crimes we give our attention.  Media attention leads to public focus leads to politician priorities leads to police enforcement.

We spend half a billion per year on law enforcement and yet violent crime continues to rise. 

In my opinion we should focus exclusively on violent crime until that starts to reduce. We can then move to property crime targeted at individuals. If we get both of those under control then maybe we can help corporations protect their assets.

CVS shoplifting losses are less than a tenth of a percent of total revenue annually (.06% in 2022). That’s the equivalent of 60 bucks for someone making $100k.  It’s less than I lose on package theft most years.

You have 1/2 of the information.  Gross revenue.  Now look for ""Gross Losses."" and determine a percentage.  See if it jives what what \*you\* think is for that single store.

Example:

CVS Gross Revenue:

[https://investors.cvshealth.com/investors/newsroom/press-release-details/2023/CVS-HEALTH-REPORTS-STRONG-FOURTH-QUARTER-AND-FULL-YEAR-2022-RESULTS/default.aspx](https://investors.cvshealth.com/investors/newsroom/press-release-details/2023/CVS-HEALTH-REPORTS-STRONG-FOURTH-QUARTER-AND-FULL-YEAR-2022-RESULTS/default.aspx)

2022: $322 Billion

From Al Gore's Internet:

""The country’s largest retail industry group, the National Retail Federation, estimated in its latest report that losses from organized retail theft average $700,000 per $1 billion in sales — or 0.07% of total sales — an amount roughly 330 times lower than the CRA’s estimate.""

Let's check their math:

CVS Gross Sales 2021: $322 Billion

""Siri, how many $700,000's are there in 322 Billion?""

Answer: 322B/$700K = 460,000

""Siri, How much is $700,000? x 322?""

Answer: ""225,400,000.00""

""Siri, expressed as a percentage, how much is $225,400,000/$322 Billion?""

Answer: .07%

.07 % (or seven tenths of a percent) is the total theft loss for ALL of CVS.  Not just one store.  So their math checks out.

Siri: ""What is the slip rate (loss from theft) for the Columbia Heights CVS Store?""

Answer:

[https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/10/03/shoplifting-organized-retail-crime-theft/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/10/03/shoplifting-organized-retail-crime-theft/)

&#x200B;

""The closest tracking comes from NRF; according to its last annual survey, involving 177 retail brands, shrink was responsible for $112.1 billion in losses in 2022. That’s a 19.4 percent spike from the $93.9 billion reported in 2021. More than half of those losses were attributed to employee theft and operational and processing errors, which climbed 29 and 27 percent, respectively.""

Thefore:  If employee theft & operational/processing errors account for (29+27 = 56%) then theft (or ""slip"") accounted for 44% of losses.

$112B x 44% = \~50 Billion in losses in 2021 from people stealing who aren't employees.  And this is an \*industry\* estimate.  Not just CVS or all Pharmacies.

And if employee theft is estimated at 29% (\~$32 Billion) then it seems that corporate wage theft is pretty closely canceled by employee retail theft.",1,2023,10,2,1,

I was at Slipstream on that same block around the time of the tweet and had not seen or heard anything; texted a friend who lives literally one building over from the one in De Souza’s picture (facing I St., incidentally), and my friend had similarly not heard or seen anything. Later turned out to be police coordinating for opening day traffic to the stadium, but De Souza never gave any context/update to her photo and the tweet is still up. So she must have been having a slow news day and decided to stir the pot a bit with some half-truths. And it kinda worked: the comments under her post are, of course, entirely unhelpful (about Navy Yard being a war zone), and feature one person blaming crime in the neighborhood on buildings taking renters with housing vouchers. Which, from what I can tell, is the kind of discourse De Souza is aiming to strike up whoever she posts. When again, no crime had occurred in the image she posted.

I don’t have anything against folks keeping their neighbors alert and aware to crime or potentially dangerous activities in their neighborhoods. Navy Yard’s had a few high-profile crimes happen over the last few years, and there’s nothing wrong with wanting to have conversations around what can be done to prevent further incidents. 

But De Souza considerably undermines whatever credibility she may have when she posts to generate fake outrage. As OP said, Yellow had been upfront about their reopening in Navy Yard being temporary because they were planning to open up a new spot elsewhere. Yellow’s own post, which De Souza quote tweeted, says as much.

It's a dumb strawman for people to focus on that derails the question of whether car free spaces is even possible in the first place. I could provide you with a whole list of [places where cars are banned](https://www.bobvila.com/slideshow/pedestrians-only-20-car-free-places-in-america-51840) and then you'd respond with a ""hurrr those places aren't REAL CITIES"" and you'd think you won your strawman.

One post up the person is complaining about driving downtown because there's now too many non car threats to them downtown. The person also responded to the concept of not driving at all in the city (which many commuters and residents do) as completely impracticable.

There are no shortage of cities [around the world](https://archive.curbed.com/2017/5/17/15649210/car-free-places-city-island) and now with the [US](https://www.amny.com/transit/times-square-car-free-1-31982299/) they are proving with proper planning and infrastructure car free/limited cars spaces are possible and practical in parts of cities.

You now have a population of obnoxious yuppies from the likes of Iowa, who have never lived in a city, think they run shit because they pull 100k from BAH, with a poor mostly black population being forced out and being treated like a nuisance...and...surprised pikachu....these groups are clashing. 

I spent my time living EOTR (deanwood) and I would be lying if I were to say there wasn't crime, some of which we fell victim to, But there was also a sense of community, people watching out for each other, friendly neighbors who welcomed us.

h5tjyy6,onh55q,brendanode,"I know a lot of people have chipped in with useful advice but I thought I’d share my experience anyways because it feels relevant 

I was involved in a traffic accident where I wasn’t at fault. I t-boned a car as he tried to make a left turn in front of me and failed to yield. After getting out of my car (I was thankfully ok despite some whiplash) the driver of the car at fault decided to chase me down and attack me, unprovoked except being convinced I caused the crash. He grabbed me from behind and punched my head while I was face down on the ground. A traffic cop witnessed this and pulled him off of me. I was transported from the scene to a hospital and while in the ambulance a police officer asked if I wanted to press charges and I said yes - he shouldn’t get away with violently reacting like that. 

After several weeks of fear given he had my name and address from the citation I was finally able to get ahold of the detective assigned to my case who informed me they decided not to pursue charges. Despite a cop witnessing and this guy having a pretty long rap sheet they felt it wasn’t worth their time. When I asked why they weren’t pushing on prosecuting this guy who committed a violent crime they told me they “didn’t have an answer that would satisfy me”. My alternatives were to sue him myself or let it go, which I did since I just wanted the ordeal behind me. 

I’m not saying this will be your outcome but know they’re apparently working with such limited resources they can opt to not do anything, so just prepare for that possibility.

For a loose boundary, I am thinking of the blocks between Washington Circle and DuPont Circle and those between New Hampshire and Rock Creek Park.  Studios are common and may or may not come with a slightly higher price point than 2k, (for example, the Savoy apartments are packed with GW students who may sublease cheap).  But there is no better location than the West End to access all those things you want to do in that month.  

From the West End you can easily walk/bike to lots of food and drink options (restaurants, bars, Whole Foods, Trader Joe’s), different neighborhoods, including some that have been mentioned (Georgetown, Foggy Bottom, DuPont Circle),  Mother Nature (Rock Creek Park and the Potomac River), and major, must-see sites (The White House, the Kennedy Center, the Smithsonian Renwick Museum and the portion of the National Mall that has the Lincoln Memorial, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, the Korean Veterans Memorial, Constitutional Gardens and the Watergate Steps that overlook the Potomac River).  

For everything else, metro.  You have easy access to all the train lines except for the green and yellow lines.  But those are only a few stops away and you are unlikely to use them much.  It’s better to be close to the orange/blue/silver lines to not only access places in DC that you may want to see, like the Capitol building, National Zoo, and other Smithsonian museums, but you can also easily visit places in Virginia, like Arlington Cemetery, the Pentagon, the Iwo Jima memorial, and the Pentagon City Costco.
