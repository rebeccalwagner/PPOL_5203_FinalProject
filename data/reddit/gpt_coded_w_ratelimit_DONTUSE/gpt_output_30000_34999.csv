ha27w3m,p90h2e,CaptainObvious110,Thank you. You remember Woolworths The fish market between irving and Columbia road? what about Waffle House?,4,2021,8,2,1,
h9ww27z,p90h2e,bigatrop,"For what it‚Äôs worth, I‚Äôve lived in DC for 21 years and have lived everywhere (including owning a home in Bloomingdales and Petworth). And I‚Äôll be the first to admit that the neighborhood of Columbia Heights has some serious issues. Yes there are awesome streets and great food options, but there are too many streets with violence and gang issues. Other neighborhoods have problems as well, but Columbia heights seems to have more. Having said that, I am in that hood nearly every week for takeout, shopping, or visiting friends. So it doesn‚Äôt bother me one bit.",4,2021,8,2,1,
h9vd88z,p90h2e,HVTS,"Yeah most of these comments are wild. I‚Äôve spent a lot of time in Columbia Heights, mostly in the evening, and a number of friends have lived there/still live there (mostly women). I shopped at that Giant and Target pretty regularly. I‚Äôve have never felt scared to be there. The street harassment seems about average, maybe slightly above. I‚Äôve had worse problems on the 80 bus, honestly. 

I get people saying the metro is chaotic but that wouldn‚Äôt deter me. A friend lived in a row house on the same block as the metro and got sick of the noise after a few years. Personal preferences.",12,2021,8,2,1,

It's a rough neighborhood but honestly the only truly ""safe"" neighborhoods by their standards are Adams Morgan, Georgetown and Cleveland Park which (I don't really like to say) is the white side of town. I don't think anybody realizes how voluntary segregated DC is. The eastern part of NW, NE, and SE are all mainly minority neighborhoods and deem ""dangerous"" by media and well...you know.

h9vecvv,p90h2e,Loki-Don,The DC crime maps don‚Äôt lie. I understand you might feel a bit insulted or protective because you own property there but the gentrification that looked so promising in the 2005-2015 time frame has completely reversed. The crime stats are pretty telling.,6,2021,8,2,1,
h9vxadj,p90h2e,Meccha_me_2,"That‚Äôs nice but when? We‚Äôre talking about the state of the city right now. I lived here for three months in fall 2020 and was stalked and harassed to the point that I had to move. I have not had that experience since moving. I also used to live next to the Rhode Island ave stop which is notorious for being a little shady and I never felt truly unsafe there. Shit got weird often, but I was safe.

I just get frustrated when people say the claims are ‚Äúabsurd‚Äùwhen it‚Äôs based on personal experience. Is it absurd for me to say Columbia heights is unsafe when it‚Äôs the only part of the DMV I felt unsafe in and the only one I had to leave prematurely?",2,2021,8,2,1,

They not even faze by it anymore since they lived there for 30+ years. It's normal.

I‚Äôm a quiet neighborhood side street with those 1m condos next to long time families. 

I deal with survival sex workers, assault, ODs, the never ending rats the size of small children (hyperbole) and just general jackassness‚Äîon the ‚Äúquiet‚Äù street, mind you.

In ten years, my friend (M, Latinx) has been beaten 3 times, robbed once on the corner walking home, bad had his place broken into. 

CH in the past 10 years has *not* gotten better. COVID has really hurt people, but **there were cracks before that thanks to the general buttholeness of the previous admin**. And, compared to northern cities (yeah I lived in West Philly in the 80s, too), there‚Äôs a LOT going on, a LOT to navigate. 

We were walking by Coffey before lockdown and a young female (like OPprobably) had her iPhone on the table. Two young kids ran in and grabbed it and were off... These small daily crimes aren‚Äôt elevated. 

You can‚Äôt even buy toothpaste at CVS without the security guard unlocking the Crest. People are doing whatever they can do to survive like stealing toothpaste.  

Reddit ‚Äîon the other hand‚Äîis talking about Michelin restaurants in the neighborhood and the same weird armed assault repost. 

At the same time, I like cities because I like to know my neighbors and say hi to them because that‚Äôs what humans do when living together in a city.

I keep saying this but I'll say it again.You have to take care of the existing people first and this means that those determined to be criminals are permanently moved out of the community unless they change. Problem is that before you do that kids have already been influenced with that mindset so you pretty much have a revolving door of foolishness.  

Just the same when they act up then they have to get the same treatment while meanwhile providing opportunities for people to better themselves.  Like for those that can stay out fo trouble offer them the option to move away with much reduced rent or something like that.

Shaw neighborhood for example used to be really affordable cuz they still routinely have some shootouts but it didn't stop the new people from buying luxury condos there,13,2021,8,2,1,

But, the previous administration forced a lot of Latinx neighborhood people underground. 

‚ÄúCrime‚Äù (and bundling other issues I correctly under that label) happens when people have either no other options or they suck as humans. I‚Äôd like to think that most humans don‚Äôt suck by choice. 

I know who the survival sex workers are because I see them every day. There is no one on this sub who can say, ‚Äúhey! She wanted this lifestyle choice!‚Äù

I know that ‚Äúcrime‚Äù (drug use, B/E, assault) migrates when given the opportunity because I see it at the end of my street off 14th now because the business closed.

The cops are 24/7 on Spring and 14th. They randomly patrol. 
*They know* who and what is happening because they see the same people every day, too. 

Does crime happen because criminals are assholes? Does that mean that there are the most ever assholes in CH?

Naw... crime happens because people don‚Äôt have other options. 

Well‚Äîexcept for those freakin crazy evangelicals. They‚Äôre just batshit and they have a choice. 

Out of the 20 years I‚Äôve been coming to DC, the past 3 have noticeably gotten worse with a much greater divide in poverty and wealth. 
 
Yeah‚Äîall politics are local. I‚Äôm from the state that gave us that politico. But, what can *local* do without the power to even control their own fiscal budget when there are generations of systemic racism to overcome?

DC is not a simple solution. I don‚Äôt pretend to have any sort of answer and try not to contribute more to the problem anymore than I do by being a white yankee transplant to DC. Laying this insanely complex problem on local government to solve?

Glover Park is quiet death. It‚Äôs beautiful. But it‚Äôs not city life as many will recognise. Mount Pleasant and Kalorama have more life in them than GP. And they‚Äôre quieter spots. If you‚Äôve come from a place where you expect great restaurants, mixed communities and walkable streets then Ward 1 will be for you. There will be blocks in CH that you won‚Äôt want to live on but that‚Äôs what happens when you live somewhere without oppressive segregation. The fact is, go to a block that people in this thread think is sketchy and walk two blocks away and you‚Äôre somewhere with fantastic restaurants or coffee shops or million dollar homes.

I‚Äôve been harsh on GP and other places like it. If you want a quiet life in the city with trees and great schools and you‚Äôre willing to drive then it‚Äôs great too.  But what a lot of people seem to buy saying is that poverty scares them (even when side by side with great wealth) and they would like to be able to isolate themselves from that.",1,2021,8,2,1,

ha47cuq,p90h2e,CaptainObvious110,"What I wish is that people would stop acting like they are better than those that are not as well off financially as they are or are of a different race than they are.  Every black man is not a thug after all. How do I know? Because I am one of them and certainly do not identify with that lifestyle at all.

Despite Columbia Heights appearing to be melting pot of cultures upon closure look it simply is not the case.  There seems to be a lack of interest in the new white residents in getting to know their new neighborhood and the people who have been there for years.  This air of aloofness is really annoying to me and the insistence on making an area appeal to them rather than integrating into the fabric of the neighborhood is something I call ""the Columbus Effect"" 

Why do I call it that? Well I already answered that in part above.  

Is it wrong to want to live somewhere that you don't have to worry about someone constantly begging you for money? No, not at all.  Is it wrong to not want to live around an open air drug market?  Of course not.

But here's the thing....If people took the time to learn about the neighborhood they intend to move into, then they would already know whether or not that is the neighborhood for them.  As mentioned, it may be that one part of the neighborhood is concerning but another part isn't and that's cool but you won't know if you don't invest a measure of time to understand the people that are already there.

I can speak on this because I have been there and done that.  I took the time to learn and take in the sights at different times and was able to move somewhere that has brought me a lot of happiness instead of misery. I've lived in places where random people would be sitting on the steps and would be in the way when you are trying to enter or leave the apartment building.  

I hate that.

I don't want to be around an area known for drug activity because that brings with it a measure of violence and drama that I want nothing to do with.  

I lived in the Trinidad neighborhood back in the mid 90's and thank goodness I didn't know that many nights what I was hearing was gunshots. I had moved there from NW just to the west of Columbia Heights and so it was definitely a different area than what I was used to.

The fact that an area can change quickly I can attest to because there was a riot in Mt Pleasant back in the early 90's that I didn't find out about until I was an adult even though I was close by.  

Best believe that when I was looking for an apartment I wanted something different. Somewhere I would feel comfortable for my friends and family to be able to walk down the street without being concerned about their safety. 

I get that. 

But what I don't get is the paranoia that has it's root on ignorance and the unwillingness to learn and to grow.",4,2021,8,2,1,
