It’s about 10 minutes from my door to the train platform, and there’s a Giant grocery store with a solid selection. I think there’s also a Safeway, but I’ve never been. There’s a new urgent care, a CVS, some reasonable (for DC) priced restaurants and some upscale restaurants, some gyms, and a UPS off the top of my head. Really the only thing I miss is a bank - there was a Wells Fargo nearby two years ago, but it’s been gone.

Where I live, you can go in one direction to make your way into the heart of the city, or you can go the other to get to nature. I live across the street from a park, and it’s about half a mile to Rock Creek Park. It’s usually pretty quiet here, for the city.

I am a full time student and work full time. It’s tough sometimes for me without any familial support, but I have been here two years. It’s only getting better as time goes on. You sound as if you’re in a much stronger financial position than me, so you’d do well here.

I have lived in DC for several years and generally recommend Bloomingdale or Takoma Park (in Maryland) area for people who like a mix. For those who want to live more outside the city and have a car, Woodbridge, VA is a nice place. That being said, the real estate companies in DC can be ruthless and terrible to deal with, especially in times of crisis. I have friends who stay at ""luxury"" or very nice apartments yet they struggle to get maintenance in or noise problems resolved. They also get hidden fees. My recommendation is to rent from people, not companies. Currently, I am helping my landlord find a new tenant for this unit in Columbia Heights, which is in DC but quieter. I wouldn't walk around at night as I am a cautious risk averse women, but this neighborhood, and Petwoth, are super nice for being ""in"" the city.

88,88,101,gcsnc4y,jwtuba,stormcloudbros,"Yes, very limited rent control in DC and that’s the biggest horror story I hear from the bigger buildings - raised rent, and you have to renew for a full year. Even in this time, people have had to literally move to different buildings because they can’t get the deals that they’re offering new tenants right now if they’re already there. Total bullshit. And in DC, once your year lease is up, you automatically go to month-to-month but these buildings force you to sign on for a year or two if you want to keep a decent rent. So the place that I mentioned with Yarmouth, not only did they not raise my rent, but they let me go month to month after my year was up.",3,2020,11,0,1,0

The fact you are only looking for 6 months and want something that starts next week will also make it much more difficult although I’m sure you’re already aware of that. 

I would suggest looking at Columbia Heights or Petworth for better deals. 

I’d also suggest looking on Craigslist. I know it can be sketchy but you can get lucky. My current place I have I consider a great deal and my friend found it by contacting a Craigslist post that had no pictures and very little info.

If you are thinking about living in DC itself, I doubt you will find a 2/1.5+ for anything under 2.1K, at least anywhere close to the area you are saying your job is at.  2.5K would probably be a better bet.  Southern Bethesda is going to be about the same.

You said you want parking.  If you are willing to commute by car, you might be able to make that budget work.  You are probably going to need to live outside the beltway north in Maryland.  I just did a search, and it seems like this place might be in your budget:

The Monterey Apartments
5901 Montrose Rd, North Bethesda, MD 20852

They seems to have two bedroom units for $1700.  I don't know the area personally, so you'd have to ask someone else about safety.  You might even be able to make the red line work there.

Oh, and a word of warning:  summer is typically the ""hot"" season (yes, I see the pun).  So there is a good chance most places will be charging more.  You might want to look into trying to lock in a place in April or May if you can.

207,207,236,cb3oryj,1ieety,meelar,"The answer to ""how to afford the rent"" is generally to economize in other areas.  There are plenty of people that don't own cars in DC (it's totally unnecessary unless your work is far away and not Metro-accessible), so the money they're currently spending on car payments and insurance can go to rent instead.  Jobs do tend to pay more here as well.  The other solution to expensive housing is roommates.  If you share a group house, your rent is much cheaper than somebody who lives alone in a studio or one-bedroom.  If your max is $700, you will probably have to get a room in a shared house--that is very low for a studio almost anywhere in the city.  It could happen, but don't completely count on it.

As for crime, it does happen, but ultimately I wouldn't let it dissuade me from moving here.  Don't leave anything valuable--or honestly anything at all--in your car if you're parking it on the street.  Be aware when you're walking around.  Generally, these two tips are enough to keep you out of trouble.

Can't really help with the rest of your questions.  Good luck with the move!",2,2013,7,0,1,"1

3) Prices: DC is one of the more expensive places to live. It's estimated that it takes the ""average"" person 80 hours to afford to live in dc.

Seriously, though, you'll do well to use the [map search function on Craigslist](http://washingtondc.craigslist.org/search/apa?minAsk=&maxAsk=1500&minSqft=&maxSqft=&query=). Anywhere within a half mile or so of a Metro in Arlington should be (and even feel) safe. Likewise, in DC, most of the more established neighborhoods around the Metros (though perhaps less so on the East side of the Anacostia river) should also be plenty safe. Arlington has kind of a yuppie feel, whereas DC varies by neighborhood. There's usually a lot more going on in DC.

Depending on your commute to work, I'd suggest looking around the Columbia Heights, U Street, or Shaw Metros (green/yellow lines) or Woodley Park or Dupont Circle (red line). Capitol Hill (Capitol South through Stadium Armory) is also nice, but it's mostly townhouses. Most studios/1 bedrooms here are in basements (you could do closer to H Street NE, which is a great neighborhood, but you'd be more reliant on buses to get to the Metro). 

Also, you'll likely see a lot of listings for Crystal City in Arlington. It's very safe, so don't be scared of it, but it's also an exceptionally boring neighborhood that gets nearly dead at night. Most things happening there are the primary landlord's (Vornado) attempts to make it seem hip. I haven't seen any recent stats, but, when I moved to DC, Crystal City had something like 70,000 people working there and only 6,000 living there, and it feels like it every day when I get out of the office late.",5,2015,4,0,1,"1

No, hiring practices do not decide to not hire people because of the color of their skin.  Affirmative action and similar efforts are only foots in the door, this whole ""hire people based on the color of their skin"" is right wing hysteria that the media feeds their viewers.  Just like your comment on DEI.  DEI is about internal practices to avoid discrimination, it doesn't put minorities on a pedestal.

Liberal people, including white people, agree that crime in cities is mostly about culture.  What they don't agree is that it inherently has to do with their skin color, but rather policies that were in place (that may or may no longer be) that disenfranchised minorities and placed undue burden on them to succeed, that didn't apply to white people.  As well as, unwritten policies like bank loans, etc that historically discriminated against minorities.  These have lasting effects that can be felt for generations, we aren't too far gone from when such policies were in place.

Your experience with a ""black friend"" is a dog whistle.  

No, that list of police brutality you just listed is highly cherry picked. They also come after years of actual police brutality and targeting of minorities. The guy who called the police and was being attacked by a woman with a knife was immediately shot by police, even when they had the description of the attacker which was nothing like the guy. The lady who was following orders and was still shot in her own kitchen.  The caretaker of the mentally ill guy who was shot even though he was unarmed, and assisting the mentally ill person who was having an episode.  Not to mention all the interactions where they ""should have just complied"", but when it's a white person it's them asserting their rights.

Your entire comment is an unhinged rant.  Baltimore definitely has an education problem.

It’s no different than if Americans decided to up and move to another country and then complain about how that country operates, lmaooo.

I also believe that we need to take steps to reduce poverty and the impact of poverty, but we need to take both these steps simultaneously.

The poverty cycle, for all races, is at least partially a cultural issue, as those in poverty raise impoverished kids who learn how to live and make the decisions in the same way their parents do. Once one generation of the family breaks the poverty cycle their kids also tend to stay out of crime themselves, even if they are not wealthy.

You realize that a black man did a full research study into ""systemic racism"" and found that it's not really a thing, other than they have ti get rougher with people that won't comply.

(Harvard Economics Professor Roland Fryer discussed the fallout from a 2016 study he published on racial bias in Houston policing.)

""The study found that police were more than twice as likely to manhandle, beat or use some other kind of nonfatal force against blacks and Hispanics than against people of other races. However, the data also determined that officers were 23.8 percent less likely to shoot at blacks and 8.5 percent less likely to shoot at Hispanics than they were to shoot at whites.""

He then extended this research country wide and got the same results. That in cases where the offenders are rude and non-compliant, or live in high crime areas, police may be rougher, but they are more likely to go to the extreme with white people.

Now, you have racism vs jews and whites as ""payback"" for the south having slaves? People tend to forget that racism wasn't a ""country-wide"" thing, anyways. The Xivil War wasn't even ""about slavery."" It was about 80 years of federal government overreach.

You're trying so hard to try and paint Nazis and Marxist with the same brush, and it's fucking embarrassing. They are nothing alike, they are polar opposites on the political spectrum Nazis will forever be authoritarian right, and Marx, lib left. It's why the Nazis put socialists in camps.


>I lived through the Cold War era.

Which involved neither Marxism, or fascism. Fascism was entirely killed off, a dead end ideology until skin heads here at home took it back up. Neither Stalin or Lenin took directly after Marx. They both changed things for their benefit. Which is a far more authoritarian government. A leftist one to be sure, but not Marxism (which is also pretty much dead). They are not the same.

>Fascism is simply the Italian version of the German national socialism. Both are still socialism.

No, fascism is an ideology. Fascista was the Italian fascist party, and the NSDAP was the german fascist party. Neither are socialist,  because once again, they threw socialist into camps.


So just to be 💯 % clear. The fascists threw socialists into concentration camps. They wore red triangle badges to identify why they were there, waiting to be killed.

741,741,574,lzpvhmj,1h2wunn,SanityLostStudio,"It did find that it's not really a thing, as the way it is presented in current media and by most people that are left of Center.

As I stated, there are bad people, and racists, but this idea that it's systemic has been destroyed by MANY black academics. Thomas Sowell, Ben Carson, and other are all called ""Uncle Toms"" and ""House You-Knows"" anytime they present evidence to the contrary.

Today, you have literal hiring practices that discriminate. It's not just ""this hiring manager is a racist."" It's, ""no we won't hire you based off of skin color or sexual orientation, because we have to hit quotas."" That is systemic racism.

Let's look at Baltimore City, ran by Democrats for the majority of it's last 30+ years. Unfortunately, the thing is, talk to any corner boys, every honest convo is that they know the ""culture"" is the problem. The majority of people that say it's not, are white Liberals that never step foot in these neighborhoods. 

Let's look at most of the top recent examples of ""racist police"" that were MAJOR stories. Smollette faked a hate crime and got let off with charges dropped. A lady attacked a cop with a knife. Another famous dude attacked cops at a traffic stop. A guy was super high on fent. And all of these were called ""systemic racist examples of police brutality,"" until body cam footage and coroner's reports got released.

""Systemic Racism"" is racism baked into the system. That's the definition of D E I. That's the definition of reparations, to people that had nothing to do with that history, nor did their families, and paid for by even those in the North that never owned anyone and their families faught and died for the cause, yet they are still hated today, because they are grouped with ""their race.""

So again, Baltimore City 2 or 3 years ago had ZERO of 2000+ students across all public schools and grade levels pass grade level math and single digit % passed reading on state exams. Democrat policies like ""no child left behind"" pass these students and then they can't get jobs, because they aren't prepared. Then when they cant get a job, it's because of the ""racist white manager,"" or racism, in general.

Ask my buddy, he's 32, cant read much. He HATES the system, because it set him up to fail, but the system that failed him passed him, because failing him, holding him back, and teaching him was deemed ""racist"" by liberals. (WhichI used to be back in the Georve W Bush days)

The issue, again, is that with 300+ Million people, all with different upbringings, and current culture blaming each other for problems, instead of actually trying to fix things the right way, it MAKES racists, and makes things worse.

Most black people I know HATE the ""White savior"" complex of rich white kids fighting for things they never asked them too. They also don't like being told that single parent households are cool.

Racist exist, they are bad people, but the ""systemic"" issues don't exist the way people claim they do.

That doesn't mean I'm saying it NEVER existed, I'm saying that the pendulum swung the other way and all it's done is created more bad people, not made things better and that when the educated black community comes out saying these same things, they are called names and ran off by race grifters and 20 yr old white kids from the suburbs.",4,2024,11,1,1,0

Numerous civilizations have sprung from tiny tribal beginnings to become amazing advanced civilizations, amid war and conflict, in a very difficult world to even survive in. 

What you are doing amounts to racism, because you are saying the people of these countries naturally just don’t have the ability to do what other countries have been able to do. In reality, they made different choices, ones that didn’t lead to successful futures for their countries. It’s not that they made all the right choices, and simply couldn’t accomplish more than  becoming third world countries.

The US started out as a smaller country; one that was just getting started. It wasn’t always a huge wealthy country. Americans built it into a huge prosperous country, over 248 years. Had America ended up as a third world country, no one would have blamed the countries around it for this happening. Similarly, if we allow our country to turn into a third world banana republic, no one is going to give us a pass, and blame other countries for this happening. They will, rightly, blame us for what we turn our country into. 

Personal responsibility is a thing.

The reason you see cities crumbling into crime and squalor is specifically because it’s not PC to hold people responsible for their actions. Instead, it’s PC to blame everyone around them for their own failures. People generally tend to meet the expectations society has for them, rather than exceeding those expectations. 

If you have no expectations, regardless of how seemingly well intentioned this lack is, you’re setting society up for failure.  Why do you think very poor Asian families come here, and, in a generation, have become prosperous? They have strong expectations of their children.",1,2024,11,1,1,0

What it does state is if you are a black murder victim you are 20% less likely to have law enforcement clear your murder through the arrest of criminal offenders versus years previously 

it simply doesn’t make the assertion of the race of any offender. 

it doesn’t make one claim of the race and it specifically states that the cause can’t not be attributed towards rising levels of gang- and organized-drug activity in major cities as the drop in clearance rate stating

“the general nature of police jurisdictions – urban or rural, large city or small, suburban or exurban – also fails to easily explain the racial divide in clearances. 

The decline in clearance rates for African American homicides occurred throughout most communities in the United States, regardless of size.”

What’s interesting is the timeframe and regional data of the decline. 

9 years after the civil rights act and as stated

“The rate of decline for clearance of black-victim homicides occurred most slowly in the Northeast (15.8 percentage point decline) and most rapidly in the South (20.6 percentage 
points), the Midwest (21.7 percentage points) and West (24.0 percentage points).”

On that note, getting rid of police, military, and national guard would be a silly thing to do. They are all necessary forces to keep the state running. That does not mean they are without their faults. As I mentioned, we see new videos on the Internet every week of cops in the US commiting crimes and putting people's lives in danger more than helping. To me, it seems hypocritical to be pro police reform AND anti gun. We, as US citizens, have been extremely lucky to have seen little to no conflict on US soil thanks to the efforts from the state as well as geographic location. All of the disruption comes from within. If anything, we need MORE police but need to also raise the physical and mental requirements it takes to take and maintain ranks within the police force. Too many trigger happy idiots out there with a hero complex itch to scratch. We also need to prosecute police for committing these crimes and ban them from being to serve elsewhere once they step over that line, rather than investigating themselves and finding no wrongdoing

If you read my comment, I stated that individuals' self protection is up to the individual and the individual only. The support of banning something that you don't personally like, does nothing but hurt someone else's ability to protect themselves. I stated that the state doesn't want you to be able to protect yourself, as shown by terrible self defense laws outside of the home in the DMV. All the while, they allow violent criminals on the streets killing, robbing, and stealing and refuse to prosecute said crimes or make any effort at stopping/hindering these things. These sorts of violent actions allow the state to push agendas such as ""well if they didn't have access to guns, this wouldn't have happened"" when they would have committed the crime or a different crime anyway. They do this rather than actually trying to solve the problem. This tactic gets scared people on board with banning guns.

The state wants you to be defenseless so you call for more help from them. What is that help? More people with guns. Crime is going to happen whether you like it or not, so people need to be able to defend themselves with the tools the individual finds to best suit their needs.

Edit: to summarize, there is a balance of people being able to protect themselves, police doing their jobs correctly, and the state putting criminals away in a swift and orderly fashion. The semantics of it all go much deeper than I can comprehend, and I offer no solution. However, banning guns won't stop this shit from happening.

DDOT isn’t responsible for enforcing real time traffic problems. If they were, you’d see them out directing traffic all day every day. The idea of that proposal is for rush hour and traffic emergency. 

Do you really believe that the Council has stopped the police from being our major law enforcement arm? If so, how is that enforced when they don’t have the power to direct the police? Where are the directions that they follow? 

Also… there’s a difference between proposal and enactment. Legislation has to be enacted, regulated and explained. You believe that the Council has enacted legislation telling the police to stand down and the Mayor has so directed them?

I think that a lot of people don’t want to think about how action and enforcement happen. I think everyone forgets about the three branches, what their jobs are, and how they do them. They’d rather blame a city Councilmember than do their own deep level research beyond a WaPo article about what’s been proposed or thought about. If the Council was telling the police to stand down on all crime… why? To what end?

Policy making is boring to most people. The Council spends their time researching issues and moving money around to make the city work in ways you may not have realized. The police have NEVER been defunded. They always get their full budget— yet the Police Union shows up at community meetings and tells us that they have no money or officers. They also refused to stand with the officers who were attacked on 1/6 because they didn’t want “to upset their friends on the Hill”. 

Meanwhile the mayor is actually responsible for directing the police force. She’s the executive. She tells the police chief what to do. The chief tells the force.  The force has clearly been told to blame the Council. Where is the ire for the Mayor? She’s not responsible for debilitating the $15M that was voted for and then she characterized as “defunding” the police?

I think it’s easy to get mad at city Councilmember when you don’t actually get the way that they work (or are ignored by) other branches and agencies. Might be worth actually exploring more deeply than a few cherry picked articles on proposed legislation.

What’s wild to me is your unwillingness to see the extent to which the police have decided to stand down because we have taken away the tools that were unconstitutional and are trying to get to equitable enforcement. You’re mad because the Council tried to figure out to make things more equitable for poor people— the ticket enforcement is aimed at that. The scofflaws who rack up thousands of dollars worth of tix are not at all affected by any of our ticket escalating techniques. Poor people are. Same with decriminalizing low level crimes like turnstile jumping. That wasn’t a big focus of the police to begin with. 

The decriminalized marijuana laws were the big thing that made the police force upset. That, along with stopping the DC version of stop and frisk— jump outs.",2,2024,5,1,1,"1

For example…

Did the DC council pass legislation preventing the MPD from pursuing criminals in vehicles? Yes or no?

Did the DC council pass legislation preventing MPD from enforcing traffic violations, like speeding, etc? Yes or no?

Did the DC council pass legislation that would allow unsafe drivers with repeated traffic violations from renewing their vehicle registration and their licenses? Yes or no?

1285,1286,1156,l1ltwv8,1ce7smd,LemmeGetSum2,"Yea another group 100% made a certain style of rap the only one that would get you major money in a record deal. That group owned the record labels and distribution companies in the beginning. It led to more diversely talented ppl not attempting to get into the genre as a lot more desperate folks parroted the formula that would make you rich quicker. 

This began a cycle of ppl following the trends carried within the music that actually got the big deals. This was much like folks of other groups following genres like punk or grunge only those folks were usually spoiled or well off kids “rebelling” until they were handed high salary jobs or inheritances, etc. 

I think y’all forget for example the criminal element of rap (which started in NY) shows a profound influence from Italian American and Irish American gangster culture. There are still many ppl who follow or mimic those cultures, but they ultimately get a quick pass to become what their demographic is… one that controls decision making across all industries. 

This is literally you not being honest enough to admit how those cultures are part of the fabric of America and were mimicked by the group you happen to dislike more. 

This is a great American story of how the US was literally started with a mass of European criminals as part of its early population and as they assimilated into leadership, the group you don’t like didn’t even begin to mimic some of these behaviors until the 1950’s and 60’s to a degree that is categorical. 

It so happens the other groups by then had been raised in cultures that were committed to oppressive policy and action (we don’t have to debate that here right? Like c’mon the 50’s and 60’s we still didn’t have a civil rights bill.) 
Anyway… honest participants in this discussion know it could only be worked out through policy, but here’s the thing. The group you hate, who’s voters happen to not be the usual participants of crime have to always contend with one demographic specifically opposing or blocking any legislation that is decided to build up their communities, quality of life and status. 

You would have to literally be honest, get out of the way ideologically, and stop obstructing their participation in the democratic process to mend what took centuries to degrade (by design). What we have is a bunch of ill intended and often misguided whining by the progeny of those who designed the causes of the problem. 

The personal responsibility of the whole group that you disrespect with your disingenuous take is to vote and get laws passed to fix things they aren’t personally doing. Most Black criminals aren’t voting yet many bad faith White ppl use out of context crime stats to disrespect the non criminal tax paying Black folks and it is for sure meant with disrespectful intent whenever it’s brought into discussion. 

The key here is when the non criminal Black community votes for policy it can be guaranteed that the main and most significant opposition to their policy will be the demographic that represents like 97% of corporate and govt decision making… especially back when this became a thing, and remains so now. If only that demographic would get out of the way. lol

Going back to the Moynihan report it was predicted that the racist nature of policy on one side would lead to degradation of the other. Your “group” at least the honest ones, knew this.

If they’re not doing their jobs, they need to be called out. But you can’t blame them for not stopping bad drivers when they have been forbidden to do so by our elected legislators. At that point, the legislators have to take some blame for their actions. 

Also, advocating for the police to be able to stop people who run red lights isn’t part of a misplaced adherence to the broken windows theory. I simply don’t want my daughter hit by a car on her way to school. Right now, there are zero repercussions in DC to running reds and stop signs. Sure, a traffic camera may take their picture, but there are no repercussions for not paying the fine.

For reference, I will be using the US DOJ/ATF form 4473, which is a Firearms Transaction Record (I encourage you to look up the form). It is LEGALLY required to fill one of these out for EACH firearm purchase you make in the United States, along with whatever additional forms/information your state requires. This form also serves as a comprehensive background check by the FBI NICS. Any LEGAL gun dealer with a valid FFL (Federal Firearms License) is required by law to have you fill out this form in the US, and will not hand a firearm over to you until you fill out this form and it comes back 100% clean. If you lie on this form, it is a felony punishable by 10 years in prison along with a $250,000 fine. You will be found and arrested for trying to purchase a firearm if you are a ""prohibited person.""

>Like required training? No. 

If you want to carry a weapon in public, whether it be concealed or open, you HAVE to go through mandatory classroom and range training in most states (DC and MD are two of those states). This comes with an additional background check, fingerprint submission, and additional fees. 

>Like limiting guns to people with history of criminal records? No.

D. **Have you ever been convicted in any court, including a military court, of a felony, or any other crime for which the judge could have 
 imprisoned you for more than one year, even if you received a shorter sentence including probation?**

E. **Are you a fugitive from justice?**

F. **Are you an unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana or any depressant, stimulant, narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance?**

J. **Have you ever been convicted in any court of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence, or are you or have you ever been a member of 
the military and been convicted of a crime that included, as an element, the use of force against a person as identified in the instructions?**

L. **Are you an alien illegally or unlawfully in the United States?**

>Like limiting guns to people with history of mental health conditions? No. 

Form 4473, Section B, Question 21, G

G. **Have you ever been adjudicated as a mental defective OR have you ever been committed to a mental institution?**

>Like the requirement of a gun license like people need a driving license to drive? No. 

Driving is a privilege granted to you by the state, not a protected natural born right under the United States Constitution. They hand out drivers licenses like fucking candy. Any 16 year old can do damage with a 4000 pound hunk of metal traveling at 70 miles an hour into a crowd of people 

>Your “so much gun legislation” limiting excessively dangerous parts like bump stocks or expanded magazine sizes haven’t done shit. 

This kind of almost proves my point. Limiting these things HAVE NOT done ""shit,"" because all it does is hurt law abiding citizens. Do you think criminals care about the Hughes Amendment in 1986 effectively banning any new ""machine guns"" from being made and made purchasable by citizens? DC has a magazine capacity ban, do you think criminals who rob, steal, and kill care about that? No, they do not because you got gang bangers running around cities across the entire United States with Glock switches that make their guns full auto with 33 round sticks. 

>You didn’t say anything worth taking away. You’re using the same tires arguments that have been used for generations while we idly sit by watching more and more people lose their lives. 

This is just wild to me. It's not tired, it's true. Your safety falls on you, and you only. The police have no legal obligation to protect you, we hear about this time and time again. In the 1981 case Warren v. District of Columbia, the D.C. Court of Appeals held that police have a general ""public duty,"" but that ""no specific legal duty exists"" unless there is a special relationship between an officer and an individual, such as a person in custody. To expand, only 44k people die a year from guns violence. 52% of those deaths are from suicide. The remaining 21k people a year come from gang violence, famlicide, and other violent crime. Those are extremely small numbers. You wanna know what's wild? 400,000 people die EVERY YEAR from medical malpractice, but you don't see stories like that flooding the media and people taking to the streets for reform. Equal amounts of deaths every year separately for alcohol, tobacco, drugs, and obesity.

I ask questions for understanding, not snark. I don’t get what I said that indicates that I hate the police. 

I am coming from a place of wanting things to be safe— I don’t want your daughter hit, either. Why would I?

I have seen police officers addressing things selectively; I have also paid close attention to what they say, what the union says and what the law says.  My perspective is different from yours and doesn’t involve believing that any part of our governance is perfect. It’s also not based on defunding the police. But it is based on ME being safe in my community— just like your daughter, I’m someone’s kid. I also want my parents to be safe in our shared community, and for you to be safe. I can respect your experience without belittling it. 

The fact that I don’t find the police to be the #1 solution to my safety issues means that you and I have different experiences of law enforcement. 

You have leapt to a series of conclusions that aren’t my ideas. I don’t believe the resolution of the crime issue in the District lies in either recalling Councilmember or in more police. I don’t think any one CM is responsible for our current crime rate. 

I actually have faith in policy making.

1354,1355,1229,l22zwem,1ce7smd,beanlefiend,"Thanks for your example!

I would argue that this is a poor example because Roman Catholicism is not Christianity. Their catechisms are terrible. For starters: The don't believe salvation by faith alone. They think that it is going mass that cleanses you of your sin, not Christ. They believe that Mary was sinless and a co-redeemer with Christ. They believe Mary was sinless. They believe that the pope is inerrant (unable to make mistakes) and they will reject the truth of the Bible to obey the pope, who is a fallen man (that's called ""papacy""). They do not believe Christ as their intercessor. It's deeply heretical and borderline blasphemous.

As for Catholicism, it's really a massive cult steeped in legalism and elitism and pomposity--the opposite of Christianity--but has zero faith and does not actually represent Christ. They may be the biggest and best example of taking the Lord's name in vain. They treat non-Catholics horribly, too (the amount of vitriol that I get from Catholics as a protestant is insane, and they treat my Orthodox friends awfully--they even call Eastern Catholics ""scum"" and excommunicate people for attending an Eastern Catholic church instead of a Roman Catholic one--what a mess!!). They are known by their fruits, and their fruits are rotten. Not to mention that they burned *actual* Christians at the stake for teaching other how to read the Bible. 

There can be *some* catholics who are regenerated, but bad (horrible) theology rarely reaps anything good, so that number is sparse.

Even if you want to disregard the above, this is another example of taking the Lord's name in vain, and therefore you cannot be a Christian influence whilst deliberately breaking moral law. In fact, remember when Jesus was being betrayed and Peter took a sword to fight one of the guards?

*”But Jesus said to him, “Friend, why have you come?” Then they came and laid hands on Jesus and took Him. And suddenly, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword, struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear. But Jesus said to him, “Put your sword in its place, for all who take the sword will perish by the sword. Or do you think that I cannot now pray to My Father, and He will provide Me with more than twelve legions of angels? How then could the Scriptures be fulfilled, that it must happen thus?”“*
‭‭Matthew‬ ‭26‬:‭50‬-‭54‬ ‭NKJV‬‬*

The kingdom of heaven is not an earthly kingdom. We put on the armor of God for the kingdom, not of man!

*”Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might. Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places. Therefore take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. Stand therefore, having girded your waist with truth, having put on the breastplate of righteousness, and having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace; above all, taking the shield of faith with which you will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one. And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God; praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, being watchful to this end with all perseverance and supplication for all the saints— and for me, that utterance may be given to me, that I may open my mouth boldly to make known the mystery of the gospel, for which I am an ambassador in chains; that in it I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.“*

I don’t think you get what it’s like to work on these issues. No one feels they have the perfect answer. We all feel like we need to solve the real time problems because we want our daughters, sons, parents, and selves to be safe too.

No assumptions were made in the above.

Thank you, I now have your example. Now, you can argue, first, \*why\* this is Christianity and, second, \*why\* this was bad and, even if it is not bad, what makes it \*worse\* than the Godless societies. Substantiating the above would fully explain your aforementioned position.

I must warn you, as not doing so would be a disservice, that by the historical synopsis of Manifest Destiny on the writings of John Winthrop, it is probably taking the Lord's name in vain and therefore would actually not be Christianity. It is definitely patriotic, but to be patriotic is not synonymous with being a Christian.

(I, actually, do not agree that there is, currently, a such thing as a Christian nation in the colloquial sense of a nation (i.e., defined by borders and law of the land and so on), or even historically, although I agree that there HAS been Christian influences upon such nations.)

(Unfortunately, when you make claims like this, you need to know the definitions that you use and in the correct context. If you do not know what is in the Bible or do not understand what is in the Bible then you will not be able to make a valid point against the object in which you wish to prove or disprove.)

(Do not misunderstand--I do not think that the endeavor of Manifest Destiny was a bad thing except for that it is sinful to use the Lord's name in vain, especially because it encouraged immigration and encouraged freed slaves to expand westward. I think your contention is that it resulted in the death of American Indians as a result of attacks on those moving west, but you have to be consistent with your viewpoint. You say that Godly societies are MORE toxic, ergo, you would also need to argue that Godless societies, these societies include the American Indians, for the record, who performed the same action did so more morally--historically speaking, pagan societies were known to r\*\*e and pillage and would launch attacks on others unprovoked, thus, I do not think you want to take this position.)",3,2024,4,1,1,0

Examples include (recently) Sharia Law or (less recently) pagans (like the Babylonians) sacrificing human beings. (B) You should read the message before this one and slow down a but and thunk about what I have said.

I am not being intentionally dumb. Conversely, I am exercising critical thinking. The question is *was* this actually Christianity hurting society, or was it people using the Lord's name in vain to commit evil? The thing is that I know that people do the latter all the time, as this is not just something historically seen. Just turn on your regular televangelist like Creflo Dollar or Joel Olsteen and you will see exactly what I mean.

But we are talking about history. I am looking for genuine examples, and instead I am told ""go read a book"". Okay, I have read many; clearly, I know history, and no, there ARE no examples of Christianity (based on the Bible--sola scriptura) being ""toxic"". My assertion is that Christianity, in particular, strongly influences ideology of western society (for now, but as we move away from God as our center, everything else falls apart--afterwards, they will persist for a time, but will eventually fall unless they turn back).

Again, this is why I say that you (and many others) enjoy the apples but you hate the apple tree.

In fact, your assertion that I am being ""stupid"" is quite hypocritical. You are actually submitting to a position but not actually exploring that position or thinking critically on the topic. Just like the original person who responded to me, you make a blanket statement, but you do not give a concrete example and explain it. Instead, it seems that somebody told you something in school, or you watched something in a video from someone else's perspective, and you did not think further about it. The result is that you have a position and either you do not know why you have it or you do not care why you have it (which if you are apathetic, you are not actually convicted of your position, and you are being dishonest). That is the beginning of weak societies.

On the contrary, when I hear something, and what all modern intellectuals that you read about today like Rousseau and Socrates (in this instance, an opinion on history), I want to read about it, understand it, and determine my own thoughts on it. Moreso, when I hear something at in a Christian book that is not in line with reformed theology or Bible hermeneutics, I read the scripture that was referenced, I look at what the early church fathers believed, and then I build my own rationale for it. This is how you learn things.

And what I am saying is not baseless. You aren't refuting anything, despite my saying that I presume these things to be true (and nobody who believes in God calls Him ""sky fairy"" or its variants--that's an antagonistic term that originated from butthurt atheists).

No, you are wrong. I believe the Bible because it is a reliable collection of historical documents written down by eyewitnesses during the lifetime of other eyewitnesses. They report to us supernatural and specific events that took place in fulfillment of specific prophecies and claimed that their writings are divine rather than human origin.

*”For we did not follow cunningly devised fables when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of His majesty. For He received from God the Father honor and glory when such a voice came to Him from the Excellent Glory: “This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.” And we heard this voice which came from heaven when we were with Him on the holy mountain. And so we have the prophetic word confirmed, which you do well to heed as a light that shines in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts; knowing this first, that no prophecy of Scripture is of any private interpretation, for prophecy never came by the will of man, but holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Spirit.“ 
2 Peter 1:16-21*

To think that those who wrote the words into the Bible, the prophets, two kings, Moses, martyrs/apostles, one queen, a physician, a tax collector, and many more... were illiterate...? ...when they simultaneously ""wrote""... the Bible. Do you read the things that you say before you say them?

But you believe the Gallic Wars happened which was written about 900 years after it happened, and Aristotle which was written over 1400 years after it happened (oh, and these, *so* educated when he believed in a geocentric solar system... but when it comes to the Bible which has oldest manuscripts within decades of the event (all written before 70 AD when the temple was destroyed)... 🤔 Something isn't adding up...

Again, you *think* that you are describing me, but you fail to even describe your points, and you cannot even articulate your contentions well because you hate theology, but you also don't know theology. It's like saying that you do not like banans, but you've never eaten one.

God did not commit genocide (more on this later)--(a) that would mean that God is like man and He is not, so you need to get your vocabulary straight, (b) why did God send a flood?

Read it (I behoove you to not bring up the Bible when you don't know it):

*""Now it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born to them, that the sons of God saw the daughters of men, that they were beautiful; and they took wives for themselves of all whom they chose. And the Lord said, “My Spirit shall not strive with man forever, for he is indeed flesh; yet his days shall be one hundred and twenty years.” There were giants on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men and they bore children to them. Those were the mighty men who were of old, men of renown. Then the Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every intent of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. And the Lord was sorry that He had made man on the earth, and He was grieved in His heart. So the Lord said, “I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth, both man and beast, creeping thing and birds of the air, for I am sorry that I have made them.” But Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord.“*
‭‭*Genesis‬ ‭6‬:‭1‬-‭8‬ ‭NKJV‬‬*

See, man has sinned against an almighty God. You do not set morality for God, He sets it for you. We deserve death, but in His mercy, he gives us another day, He is patient with us, and everyday that this body lives, is mercy to repent and believe in Him. Therefore, when God sends a flood, or sends a plague, it is divine judgement. He is so much greater than you or me or anyone else.

What do you believe?

You hate the scripture that you neither know nor understand so much that you're raging.

*”Why do the nations rage, And the people plot a vain thing? The kings of the earth set themselves, And the rulers take counsel together, Against the Lord and against His Anointed, saying, “Let us break Their bonds in pieces And cast away Their cords from us.” He who sits in the heavens shall laugh; The Lord shall hold them in derision.“*

Security lacks and there is no 24/7 concierge, unlike every other building in Navy Yard. I pay over $2300 a month for my 1bd/ba, which is a lot for the stress of all of that. Management has changed 3x in my last year and half of living here and while Shaniqua is very responsive (which is more than I could say for previous managers), the rest of the leasing office staff weren't pleasant to deal with when I brought a potential issue to their attention. Ultimately, the issue never happened, so it was a non-factor, but the experience spoke volumes and put me off. Very thankful that I haven't had major issues that require their attention.""

""When we first moved in (late 2020) we had a very positive experience and the Google reviews were actually quite good, but things quickly went downhill when it became clear that management was neither capable nor interested in dealing with problematic tenants. Some residents are unruly, and at times dangerous. We had large groups of teenagers sprinting through the halls at night multiple times, and at one point they pulled the ""exit"" sign out of the ceiling so it was dangling by the cords. Tenants would blast loud music late into the night/early morning on weeknights.

There were multiple violent incidents between residents in common areas like the roof and lobby, and at one point a resident attacked and tried to stab the front desk person, which is supposedly why the building got rid of the 24-hour concierge (a standard amenity for luxury buildings in DC). Other than removing the 24-hour concierge, management did nothing to address any of these issues, leaving tenants in potentially dangerous situations. The after-hours emergency line was non-functional, and because there was no front desk person when we got locked out, we sat in our hallway for hours late at night before we finally got a hold of someone to come from Maryland to help us. Police were consistently parked outside the building for one reason or another, and not just for nearby issues, but for issues with residents in the building.

Our hallway constantly reeked of cigarettes and the elevators almost always had what I'll refer to as varying ""mystery smells."" The elevator floors were almost constantly covered in some type of nondescript liquid. Someone on our floor would consistently leave loose trash or open bags of trash on the floor by the trash chute, and sometimes just in the middle of the hallway. We started referring to them as the ""trash bandit."" We notified management and provided photos multiple times, but other than putting up a sign on the trash room door, nothing changed.

It's a shame because the building itself is quite nice. We enjoyed our unit and didn't need any repairs in the time we lived there. The folks at the front desk and leasing office are very kind and do a good job. The location is super convenient to the metro and all the fun places Navy Yard has to offer. Unfortunately, there seems to be a fundamental failure at the building management level, and it negatively affects the tenants.""

At one point they did give us a ""public safety"" exemption on the eviction freeze, but the language was so narrowly tailored as to be nearly impossible to use.  So today you have eviction cases for actions that happened years ago, basically.  

Just to give you a sense of the extent of what tenants could do, I had a client who had someone arrested for breaking into a unit.  The guy got a desk appearance ticket (at this time DC wasn't holding criminals in jail) and went right back to the building and robbed another unit THE SAME DAY.  Couldn't evict him.  Another client had a unit that was taken over by squatters running drugs and guns, who kicked down the door of an 80-year old resident to try to take over her unit thinking it was also vacant.  Those guys stayed in that property for months and months and almost beat still another man to death who went there for a family visit having nothing to do with them.  Couldn't evict them.  

DC didn't do one thing for us.  We spent MONTHS trying to meet with Councilmembers to explain the difference in eviction types and that banning evictions for bad conduct was bad policy, we attempted to meet with Karl Racine to try to get the OAG to do something to evict the tenants from the units on the basis of a nuisance (he sent an underling and proceeded to do nothing to help), and at every step of the way we explained law abiding citizens in these properties were being beaten, were afraid to leave their units to even go to the grocery store, and we still got nowhere.  

Councilmembers didn't at that time (and even today in some cases) understand basic facts of the eviction process and that conduct cases are much harder to complete than a nonpayment case.  They didn't understand that it was unrealistic for landlords to try to BS conduct cases as a way to tag tenants who were not paying rent.  Instead, the Council were just doing any and everything the tenant advocacy community wanted in the name of scoring political points.  Higher filing fee to evict?  Check.  More attentuated notices required to evict?  Check.  Additional licensing requirements to evict and raise rent?  Check.  More constrained background check process?  Check.  More limitations on what reference you can even give for a tenant that was evicted?  Check.  

That is how you ended up with stories like this one, which try to paint it as a problem with some greedy management company when in reality DC just has completely terrible tenancy laws at this point that invite bad actors into the City.  Entire buildings were basically ruined by the actions taken by the DC Council during the pandemic in the name of tenant rights.",6,2024,4,1,1,"1

1). Technology to track every firearm, you mean like a national registry? Because that would be against the law thanks to the Firearm Owners Protection Act which ""prohibits the federal government from creating a national gun registry by stating that the government may not consolidate or centralize records of firearms ownership or possession."" Or are you referring the something like the ""bullet ID program"" from Maryland that cost taxpayers $5M over 15 years and solved 0 cases. 

Also, throwing an air tag on someone's car without their knowledge is illegal and is considered stalking. So not sure what your angle was here. I hope you aren't doing that. 

2) Unlawful possession of a firearm is already a 10 year sentence and is usually attached to other charges. But you can write all the laws you want, it doesn't work if the DA doesn't prosecute people. Right now, the DC DA only prosecutes 2/3rds of people that commit UPF. 

3) Too many dudes with mullets concerned about their freedoms - I don't know any lawful gun owner that wants to keep firearms in the hands of the criminal. However, every time gun control advocates push for gun control, they take the ability to purchase and carry a firearm for self and home protection out of law abiding Jane and John Doe. Case in point Carol Bowne who was murdered by her ex because New Jersey didn't want to give her her right to protect herself  ['No one helped her': NJ woman murdered by ex while awaiting gun permit | Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/us/no-one-helped-her-nj-woman-murdered-by-ex-while-awaiting-gun-permit). Every gun control law in the book does nothing but hinder law-abiding citizens. Never has a Gun Free Zone sign, an assault weapons ban, or magazine capacity ban done anything to save a life. But I am curious, what would be some measure you could implement that would not inadvertently cause innocents to die or be subject to other crimes? And before you throw out the Australia Assault Weapons ban, I suggest you do some research before I make you look stupid.",5,2024,3,1,1,"1

I wouldn't  risk it necessarily, but you're less likely to have problems in Union Market than other parts of NoMa and certainly other parts of DC. 

It's not without its problems - there was a shooting right outside my old apartment just a few weeks ago - but its safer than H Street, U Street/Shaw, Navy Yard, etc. It isn't going to beat the safety of the good parts of NW DC, but it also has much more to do, eat, and drink.

Income inequality and concentration of wealth vs poverty is the driving force behind the anecdotal dog-whistley things you cite. Those phenomenon are brought on by governance that prioritizes profit over people.

In Section 8, you’d pay the $150 to the landlord and the voucher would cover the rest of the rent. It’s possible with utilities to just get free rent and a check to cover some/all utilities  based on the formulas.

They do not give vouchers to teenagers, you’re full of shit. There’s a long waiting list and it’s very difficult to qualify for the voucher program, I would know because I am apart of it.

3583,3589,3590,kj1nuin,19cjyej,bnralt,"Just my personal opinion. For a background, I’m a D.C. native, went to DCPS, going back a few generations. Lots of family and friends in the city itself and the surrounding area.

First of all I want to say that you’re going to get a very skewed idea of D.C. locals from the other two subs, both of which are mostly non-D.C. natives. The big one seems to be mostly people with somewhat sheltered upbringings in white suburbs and seem to have this idea that they’re “slumming” living here. Back when gentrification was really taking off, it was usually longtime locals who would warn people they say walking around a neighborhood about crime, and these types of transplants that would laugh and dismiss those concerns (I’m not sure how much that’s changed, though).

They’re the kind of people who always say, “Oh, you mean your from the city itself? That’s pretty rare here.” I usually respond, “That depends on who you hang out with,” because a lot of them do seem to hang out with other successful transplants.

That’s fine, no hate. The problem is a good portion of them seem to not have had a lot of interactions with black people in the past, then hang out in groups that don’t have a lot of black people. They don’t take much notice of the numerous hard working black people in the city, see the few who commit crimes, and think to themselves “Well, I guess black people commit crimes, in order to be nice to black people I should be nice to criminals.” It’s a really weird mindset, and the people pushing this are (I have to assume inadvertently) pushing a very negative portrayal of locals.

Now I’m talking about how these transplants have a weird view of black residents, but it’s important to point out that D.C. natives with black residents of D.C.  aren’t the same thing. The city was only majority black for a little over a generation, and even during that time about 1/3 of its residents weren’t black. A lot of people who come here don’t have a good sense of how this city (and the surroundings) have changed historically, adding to their skewed view of things. There’s also been a lot of movement from the city to the suburbs and vice versa over the decades (across all demographics). Which is actually a good segue into the other D.C sub.

A lot of people here seem to think the other D.C. sub is indicative of “D.C. culture” and its failures. But if you’ve looked around there, it’s pretty clear that almost all the people there are folks living in the suburbs who seem to think they inherited D.C. residency. This probably sounds strange if you haven’t come across it, but it’s something that’s not uncommon in this area. Someone who was born and raised in the suburbs will claim to be from D.C. because their mother grew up in the city before moving to the suburbs at 13.

My experience growing up here seems to mostly match what I read about when people talk about coming from a somewhat mediocre hometown. I don’t really love the place, I don’t really hate it. I run into people from school from time to time, and they’re all nice. Most seem to be getting along fine, but few seem to be really thriving. Many have moved to the suburbs.

I’m not going to say that there aren’t idiot locals who do stupid things, because of course there are. But when people try to paint that as being representative of locals, it’s often coming from an ignorant and cartoonish view of the city. Imagine if the worst people in your hometown were giving freedom to make life miserable for everyone around them, because some transplants moved in and had such a negative view of your town that they thought those idiots represented everyone there.",14,2024,1,1,1,"1

Something that progressives are not focused on at all is that one thing government does is create incentives... progressives right now are incentivizing all the things we don't want in society like criminality, laziness, antisocial behavior of many kinds... and they are disincentivizing the behaviors we do want in the society like starting businesses and having a career.

Eventually the ordinary working person who is not a priority at all is gonna get pissed enough to demand change. The ordinary avg working person should be the priority, not last in the list. Similarly, it's important to look out for the interests of business owners... they create jobs, generate taxes, and make the city a nice place to visit & live. Driving businesses out is just dumb.

DC, like many progressive cities, is on the fast track to being a city full of net tax consumers and declining tax revenue as all the net tax payers and businesses flee.

Also, this may seem unrelated to the native v transplant debate, but it's not. The reason is bc progressives have adopted a mentality that certain groups should get special treatment no matter how badly they behave... this is a form of privilege. This is very similar to the idea that natives should come first before transplants.

Someone said it's poverty and someone else pointed out that many of these kids aren't from super impoverished backgrounds and then someone swooped in to explain that the reason young black men are engaging in crime in such large numbers in DC was bc they don't have access to the ""halls of power and prestige""... direct quote

So a few things about that... while these kids are cutting school and robbing people, other BIPOC kids from their same neighborhood are in school and on track for college...*those* are the kids who will and *should* have access to the ""halls of power and prestige"". In fact there has never been a better time to be a BIPOC who aspires to be president or lead a company or what have you. Many companies are very actively seeking these BIPOC out.

The key to understand is that kids who have decided to cut school and commit crimes don't deserve to have access to the halls of power and prestige... if they decide to turn things around and lead a good life, then yes they shouldn't be held back by their past. But society should reward people who choose to work hard and do prosocial things like getting a high school diploma and getting a job, not antisocial things. This idea is now controversial in progressive circles

frankly i have a bigger issue with the way bowser has been selling off public buildings like libraries and community centers -- giving out 99 year leases to private developers so they can build high-end luxury apartments. i bet dollars to donuts there is some shady shit going on with that. bowser was tight with Gray during all the shady campaign dealings he had with developers. i wouldn't be shocked if it was discovered she was up to similar hijinks ",22,2024,1,1,1,"1

It was mostly drug wars that were  territorial and location specific.  Civilians did not have to fear conducting simple tasks like going to the store, driving, or shopping. 12 year olds were not car jacking civilians.

Fast forward and we find ourselves in what feels like a lawless city spinning rapidly out of control. The velocity and trajectory by which crime is sweeping through our community is both alarming and disturbing.

Until we see structural change in the penal code I am afraid this continues. Our leaders are now followers uncomfortable acknowledging there is a problem and getting ahead of it. Sticking the proverbial head in sand. Not to mention if someone does bring up crime they're automatically categorized as a trouble maker or it's turned political. More sticking of head in sand.

The current state of things is in fact very demoralizing, hence with no solution or end in sight, the city is becoming a ghost town. Money goes where it's wanted. Where we go from here? Who knows, truly. We need a radical shift in policy and in some cases ideology. Unless the federal government intervenes it will remain business as usual. We can thank our leaders for all this.

And imo the issue is centered around the way the administration has responded to calls for racial/social justice by disengaging the police from most ordinary enforcement work, to minimize conflicts with racial minorities.  Paradoxically this harms minorities worse, since they are more often the victims of crime, and since not incarcerating individuals responsible for crime allows them to have a negative impact on the well being and prospects of their relatives, friends, and neighbors.

This is a massive city. There’s instances every day of muggings and shootings. When you read every single article about them, of course you’re going to get an anxiety disorder. I still feel incredibly safe here. 
Actually, i’m much more worried about getting hit by a car or getting into an accident when i’m rarely in an uber. Way more dangerous than violent crime",1,2023,11,1,1,"1

2. *After transfers* income inequality has been going over time.

3. Grossly, wealth inequality is going down (which aligns with with income inequality going down).

So if you're trying to tell a narrative that crime is driven by *increasing* economic desperation, you'd have to account for the fact that the share of population living under such conditions has been steadily decreasing.

If you want to argue that gross income inequality drives crime, you still have to contend with the fact that *disposable income* inequality is decreasing.  Also, why is that theory even reasonable?  The poor tend to steal from the poor.

Thanks for reminding me that statistics that supported my point are available. The nonsense DC can't get a handle on is creeping over the border. As DC has no apparent plan to actually put a stop to all this crime, it will keep leaking over into VA/MD. I have no interest in living near that, especially for the price they expect you to pay, so I left.

>A number of communities across the D.C. region are feeling the spike in crime. Over in Alexandria, the police department says it's seeing record numbers. 

>Alexandria Police Chief Don Hayes told FOX 5 that in his 30 plus years of living in the city – he’s never seen crime at this level. It's now interfering with the quality of life for residents.

>All violent crime except for rape is on the rise in the city. Aggravated assault is up 53%. 

>In 2022, the police department recorded 88 assaults this same time last year — and so far, this year, there have been 138 cases. 

>""We’ve had a total of 48 shots fired calls for service in the City of Alexandria. That’s a lot!"" he explained. 

>""I can tell you; I don’t think we’ve hit this number in this timeframe in the City of Alexandria, ever,"" Hayes said. ""So that has us alarmed. There are a lot of guns out there.""  

>Burglaries and larcenies are also up, plus stolen cars are up 71% – with the most recent carjacking involving a juvenile. 

>""A 14-year-old carjacking a woman in the City of Alexandria yesterday, *fortunately he was caught in D.C.*, and the property was returned,"" Hayes recalled.

Hahahahahahahaha!!! Hahahahaa!!! Hahahahahahaha!!!

The “legal process“ for the first half of this country‘s history was get on a boat and arrive here. 

Then they added a rule, don’t be Chinese. 

That “process” lasted until about WWI. 

My ancestors got on a boat in England. They arrived at Ellis Island. Wam bam thank you ma’am, welcome to America. 

Also, a sizable portion of our country’s ancestors did not have a choice in being brought here.

Now, to the jist of your screed — we should make it easier to immigrate here more easily. And we should do what’s feasible to prevent and discourage illegal migration. 

And yet, you still need to step the fuck back and realize you’re applying **all of this** to a man in a video that all you know about is 1) he’s *working*, regardless of what you think of the value and dignity of his work, and 2) he doesn’t speak English. 

There are literally millions of people in America legally who speak little or no English. They come from all over the world. That was probably the case for your ancestors unless they were already English! Half the country was speaking German in the late 1800s.

Outside of the asylum process, the nationals of many countries in Latin America - including Venezuela - have temporary protected status (TPS). This gives them the right to work and remain in the country until that status is lifted.

Another benefit of this is that it immediately locks your phone screen and disables unlocking via FaceID, TouchID, and Apple Watch (meaning your decapitated head and severed fingers can’t be used to initiate Cash app transactions.)

Lived in Rosslyn for the last 6 and my only issues are that it's under the flight path for DCA and an Amazon driver stole a package once. Literally that's it. The downtown Rosslyn area is a corporate wasteland but within a few blocks you're in lovely quiet neighborhoods, very green, dog and family friendly, and a mix of ages. And a few streets further in North Rosslyn there's a beautiful park and community center with a walking trail behind some real richy rich houses that overlook the Potomac. Suuuuper safe and everything you need is in 5-10min walking distance - mini Target, Safeway, CVS, restaurants, several gyms, nail and hair salons, Rosslyn and Courthouse farmers market, Courthouse movie theater. Even my dentist is like 2 blocks away. Maybe not the most convenient for a Penn Quarter office but the peace of mind is so valuable. Virginia is tougher on crime than DC and Arlington is a wealthy county, and it shows - active police presence, city of Rosslyn workers cleaning up all the time, virtually no homeless.

I lived on the border between Glover Park and Cathedral Heights last year in a condo and found it to be quite safe. Many of these neighborhoods are largely single family homes, but it’s worth looking into private rooms, basement apartments, the occasional/small apartment buildings in them.

Glover Park, Wesley Heights, Cathedral Heights, Burleith, Palisades Forest Hills, Chevy Chase (not to be confused with CC in Maryland), Crestwood, Woodley Park, Cleveland Park (for the most part…), Forest Hills, Mount Pleasant. These are neighborhoods I would recommend if you are not particularly used to city living or basically don’t want to worry about safety/adjust any of your habits at all.

Georgetown can also probably be listed here, but I saw an uptick in person crime during my time in the bordering neighborhood. I don’t trust the GT/GP Safeway, personally.

I have female friends living in Capitol Hill who have found the area generally quite safe (maybe a weird grocery store here or there), as well as Shaw, and West End. My friends in NoMa seemed to like it there, as well. But I don’t know too much about the safety.",2,2024,9,1,1,"1

	NYC found nearly a third of all shoplifting arrests in the city in 2022 involved just 327 people, who collectively were arrested and rearrested more than 6,000 times. 

	In another study researchers found that 1% of people were accountable for 63% of all violent crime convictions, and 0.12% of people accounted for 20% of violent crime convictions. (Falk 2014)

	DC focused info: 
	A different analysis by the National Institute for Criminal Justice Reform finds that for the crime of homicide: “Overall, most victims and suspects with prior criminal offenses had been arrested about 11 times for about 13 different offenses by the time of the homicide. This count only refers to adult arrests and juvenile arrests were not included.” 

	Again, we see that homicide offenders typically have been arrested numerous times before they commit their first homicide. They also note that some 500 identifiable people account for 60-70% of all gun violence in the District of Columbia.",25,2024,1,1,1,"1

You have to understand the history of DC and why it was once called Chocolate City. 

During the crack epidemic people migrated out of the city because crime was rampant. Many blacks stayed because they couldn’t afford to leave. When things in the city improved people began to move back…. Increasing the housing market. Thanks to red lining it only allowed blacks to live in certain neighborhoods until 40 years ago when the Fair housing bill was passed. This affected how much money went to schools and how neighborhoods were policed amongst many other things. The more people moved back to the city the more people began to move into black neighborhoods with higher poverty levels. 

The poverty and the crime in the city is the effect of Red lining, mass incarceration, racism, and the government flooding the streets with drugs to fund a war. So, to blame a group of people who have always put at a disadvantage is irresponsible.",0,2024,1,1,1,"1

4858,4866,4959,kka9712,1aerk5y,visualcharm,"I'm new to DC and followed the sub due to the censorship of crime discussions on the main sub, so I really appreciate threads like this. In my opinion, DC is the first city to treat crime as if it were a drug problem -- with acceptability and leniency for reform, rather than enforcement. I don't know how the thought process came about because addiction and intentional crime are two different things, even if they have a lot of overlap. Even then, policymakers should have seen how open drug markets like Skid Row have terribly negative consequences to society and not applied that logic to something even more consequentially dangerous. I wouldn't be surprised if non-native criminals hear of how lenient DC is and come here to run operations, just as how drug addicts that do not want to get better flock to open drug market neighborhoods.

The longer they let this continue, the worse long-term impact will be on not just DC residents, but the country. I mean this as, the criminal activity clearly has greater backing. Cars aren't being parted out to put a meal on the table, that money is being funneled into gang activity that exceeds this geographical location. It also puts more illegal guns into circulation. On an implicit level, I was surprised to meet a medical professional who was driving without a license - they shrugged and thought it was acceptable. The leniency corrupts greater society in even this sort of way. 

I think people refuse to speak about it because the level of criminal activity here is a matter of life and death. When faced with it, the individual is helpless. Even with self-defense tools, how am I, a 95 lb woman, going to stand up to this issue? The best course of action is to lay low and hope things pass. I find myself doing that when I walk outside; I walk quickly in fear, with my jaws clenched, and hope my fear doesn't show. There is also the lingering thought that if criminals overrule the city, local law enforcement will soon lose their ability to control the situation. As in, even if law enforcement is granted more rights to exercise authority, there will be major violent protest from criminals who were allowed leniency this entire time. 

I disagree with the racial profiling that I see. I think following that line of thinking is incorrect. Instead, we need to be proactive about bringing the attention on the short and long-term consequences of a mercy-approach to morally wrong behavior to leaders and the public (like news media outlets). I remembered my trips to DC from when I was younger and had 0 inkling of the criminal growth here before I came. The more people keep to a bubble and rant about the wrong thing, the greater the allowance of how things are becomes.

There are many roots to this.  The Constitution.  Racism.  Congress.  Poverty.  Those issues have been discussed for years.

When I moved to DC, there was a Control Board that managed the city’s finances.  The prison was subject to federal court oversight.  The school system was also subject to court oversight.  Other city entities were subject to oversight.  The DMV (a shared experience for most city dwellers) was punishing for residents.  It was a true disaster.  Wealthier residents had fled en masse.  

I remember that the school system couldn’t figure out what people “did” in the school system.  They were just paying people.  The solution was to have everyone pick up their checks in-person and then describe their job on a piece of fucking paper.

Into the 00’s, the city’s finances improved, the Control Board was lifted thanks to the hard work of a team of dedicated civil servants.  The prison was closed.  Developers started building in ever new neighborhoods.  If you ever had the deal with the city, however, you knew that things had not changed.  The pits of bureaucratic incompetency and nonsense remained.  

In the mean time, all these white folks moved into the city and couldn’t figure out why they couldn’t get a new trashcan.  Now they are surprised to learn where they all moved.

So here we are.  Insane truancy rates.  A defunded and neutered police force with a basic unwillingness to enforce the law.  A police lab that has been de-certified for years (how do you process evidence without a lab)?  A US Attorney’s office focused on J6 and unwilling to deal with the bs that is the MPD.  A city council with white “progressives” (people who would do Neville Chamberlain proud), a guy who thinks that the Rothschild control the weather, and a lackluster mayor - who is way over her head.  Add some poverty and the corrupt influence of social media on the young and old - and you have got the current situation.  

It is not going to be fixed.  There may be some patches and tweaks.  The underlying issues remain.  Everyone deserves to be safe. 

In the mean time, downtown is going to die.  The teams will leave.  The workers will never return in these circumstances.  And if the Republicans get full control of the government ever again, they will spread the agencies and their workers across the region and country.

While in for repair, someone tried to break into that same minivan, scratching up all of the door handles.  3. Someone vandalized my car. 4. My son was almost abducted by a car thief.  5. My son had to jump out of the way of another car thief in front of his elementary school (edit: Actually this one happened a few years after the others).  6. My son was attacked by a bully in his PRE-SCHOOL who said he wanted him to die because he's white.  7. I was accosted by 3 teenagers and called ""an ugly white guy"" right before they threw a rock at my head.  8. My wife drove through a gang shoot-out without realizing it (she's profoundly deaf). 9. In my friend's apartment a few blocks away, kids were shooting people on the street with BB guns from their window.  The police wouldn't do anything about it.

4892,4900,4994,kkbmyae,1aerk5y,kgst,">I’m quite liberal. I hate when suburbanites and/or conservatives fearmonger about how “dangerous” cities are - calm down, when a lot of people live together, crime is statistically inevitable. Whether it’s on Fox News or seemingly every big city subreddit, the fearmongering is annoying and usually wrong. I’m sure many residents of DC share my general inclinations on this type of thing.

The author's original post demonstrates exactly why and how we've landed in the situation we are in.

Crime is not statistically inevitable as a result of large groups of people living together. Some cities have drastically higher or lower crime rates than others. Compare Tokyo to Washington DC, or Austin, TX to Detroit or any city to any other city and you'll see 2x to 100x differences in murder, crime, etc. Minimizing crime and violence as ""inevitable"" results in making no effort to actually improve the situation.

Until liberals start holding each other accountable to reality and that it's not ok to just lie constantly to push a narrative, things will continue to get worse. Wanting laws and punishments is not racist. Talking about crime is not racist or ""soft"" or ""hardcore conservative"", it's something we should all care about and try to fix. Also not passing or enforcing certain laws in the name of ""equity"" is batshit crazy.

Next time you're in a conversation and someone says ""Crime is inevitable, only conservatives have a problem with crime in major cities"", respond with ""crime is something we should all work towards reducing, regardless of where you are on the political spectrum"".",33,2024,1,1,1,"1

Widespread carry seems much more likely to incentive immediate execution of drivers by carjackers than dissuading them. Gang members haven’t stopped shooting each other despite knowing the other side can shoot back.

Yes, things need to change, and yes, a lot of people who prioritize social inequity need to re-evaluate what they think are productive ways to respond to the resulting criminal behavior. 

We have to take steps to respond to the crime that is happening now. All these reports say that the people who are committing these crimes are overwhelmingly known to police as repeat offenders. They need to be locked up. And we need to stop feeling badly about doing so. 

We also need to take a deep, long look at the intervention programs they have been in place for the last 10 years. Clearly they aren’t working. The youth of today are committing far more violent crime than the youth of 10 years ago. Is that execution? Is it substance? We need to figure out.

There’s a lot you say that I agree with, though I think you’ve left one important thing out and I hope your advice to move is wrong, because I want to see the city bounce back. 

So here’s what we need to consider: this is an epidemic of YOUTH violence. People don’t realize how negatively the pandemic impacted kids’ social and emotional development. I have a friend who for years has run a somewhat ritzy summer program for kids, and she says even those privileged kids are out of control. As an organization, they have acknowledged they have to treat 14-year-olds as if they are 11! 

Another thing I notice is people debate the value of social programs vs jail time. No! We need both! And frankly, the best medical care (including psych care) is found in the prison system. Have you ever talked to the ex cons who work with troubled kids? There are many non-profits in the city who put these ex cons in front of kids to both “scare them straight” and to teach them solid skills. 

The entire city is being held hostage by about 200 to 400 kids who need some serious interventions. I believe if we focus on both disciplining them and getting them the help they need, our problems will soon be over. We can’t give up on DC.",1,2024,2,1,1,"1
