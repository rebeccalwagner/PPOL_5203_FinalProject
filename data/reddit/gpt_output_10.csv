18,5025,5122,m0mnnp0,1h7dozg,new_account_5009,"Yes to all of the above. I'm in between the Ballston and Virginia Square Metros, and live car-free. The only time I ever need a car is when I'm traveling out of the area, and even with that, I just walk to the Avis in Clarendon (or Metro to the one near DCA) and rent a car for a weekend.  For groceries, I walk to the store and carry stuff back. For random heavy things, I usually just order online and have them shipped. There are plenty of bars/restaurants/cafes/etc. within walking distance. The only thing we really don't have are professional sports and concert venues playing my sort of music, but DC/MD is a short Metro away for that stuff.  For concerts, I usually have to trek up to Silver Spring, as the Filmore is the only venue in the area that regularly hosts metalcore acts.

You need a car deep in the Virginia suburbs, but not Arlington.",2,2024,12,1,1,
