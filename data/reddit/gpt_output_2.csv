1,5008,5105,m0kv52k,1h7dozg,Derpolitik23,"Yes, Arlington’s crime rate is lower than DC's, even though crime and related problems have become more prevalent in post-COVID Arlington.

Even though I work in DC, I chose to live in Arlington because the housing is comparatively cheaper and more modern than what’s often available in my price range in DC.

Also, better amenities like parking and more things to choose from (ex. More grocery stores available in DC are things like Safeway and Whole Foods), while within a five mile radius of where I live in Arlington I have many more choices. Even within walking distance.

Though, I would say NIMBYISM is a bigger problem in Arlington vs. DC. I think VA taxes from what I've heard are also more than the District.",18,2024,12,1,1,"1

The only time I ever need a car is when I'm traveling out of the area, and even with that, I just walk to the Avis in Clarendon (or Metro to the one near DCA) and rent a car for a weekend.  For groceries, I walk to the store and carry stuff back. For random heavy things, I usually just order online and have them shipped. There are plenty of bars/restaurants/cafes/etc. within walking distance. The only thing we really don't have are professional sports and concert venues playing my sort of music, but DC/MD is a short Metro away for that stuff.  For concerts, I usually have to trek up to Silver Spring, as the Filmore is the only venue in the area that regularly hosts metalcore acts.

Residents come and go very quickly - nobody seems to be moving in with any expectation of being there longer than a few years.  Nobody cares. Trash everywhere.

DC has a real crime problem and the statistics support that it's top 5 in violent crime in the nation (maybe top 3 by now) and top 50 in violent crime in the entire world. Additionally, violent crime is up several hundred percent from about 10ish years ago, a long with all other crime.
