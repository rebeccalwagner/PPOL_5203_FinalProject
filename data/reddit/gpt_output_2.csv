21,5028,5125,m0m462w,1h7dozg,T1S9A2R6,"I hope you’re right but online real estate calculators show my property declining in value significantly - some lower than what I originally paid. 

My house is located on the same block with several low-income housing properties.  We’ve had cops posted up on our block multiple times this year due to muggings, assaults, and public disturbances.  

Not a lot of home sales and permanent homeowners/residents in my neighborhood apparently.  Residents come and go very quickly - nobody seems to be moving in with any expectation of being there longer than a few years.  Nobody cares. Trash everywhere. Junkies passed out on front porches and alleys. This wasn’t the vibe I got when I purchased the home originally. Things have definitely gone south in the last four years.",4,2024,12,1,1,
22,5029,5126,m0l855q,1h7dozg,Seductive_pickle,"When I moved here I did a pretty intense tax calculation and it all boiled down to pretty much the same in the DMV area. 

It varies a bit based on your car ownership, home ownership, and income but honestly, it’s almost surprising how similar they all are.",3,2024,12,1,1,

25,5032,5129,m0mpw4h,1h7dozg,imissallofit,Cool. Thanks for the answer. I’ll take the metro and check it out for the rental apartments and the places to hang out.,1,2024,12,1,1,

27,5034,5131,m0m5t9i,1h7dozg,BlueminOnion420,Hm sorry I guess I could see this being the case. I like to look a home up on realtor dot com and there’s a section about values. There’s 3 companies and Quantarium seems to be pretty accurate. I’d compare the current value to purchase price as a best guess.,1,2024,12,1,1,
28,5035,5132,m0lz36g,1h7dozg,Vegetable-Ad1118,"For me, my car ownership costs twice as much as Virginia which equates to 2 weeks of work. Fucking ridiculous considering I bike everywhere and have to park on the street",3,2024,12,1,1,
29,5036,5133,m0lv3uq,1h7dozg,half_ton_tomato,"You get practically nothing for your property taxes. The 911 system is barely functioning, schools are abysmal at best, police and ambulance service are a joke, and God help you if it snows.",6,2024,12,1,1,
