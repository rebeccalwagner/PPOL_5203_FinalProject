Yes, it is outside the city proper but public transit here is good and both have cute neighborhoods where you will get more for your money.

I could live in Greenbelt and be an easy Metro ride to the 930 but I wouldn't recommend that to a short-term visitor, either.

As far as restaurants, some people might be OK running up a $400 check at Kinship or the Dabney every week, but what Dupont gives you is a plethora of options for daily life, often within less than a block of walking, and Shaw just doesn't compare.

It‚Äôs not necessarily Bozzuto‚Äôs fault in this case as a lot of times management companies don‚Äôt hold enough power to reasonably change anything. 

Now having a good staff that can relay that to owners is a different question, but it‚Äôs still on that owner to okay it or not really. Different ownership groups care different amounts about ‚Äúextra‚Äù things. Your mileage will vary across groups. 

If the ownership group doesn‚Äôt want to pay for things, the management group then becomes the ‚Äúbad guy‚Äù and that‚Äôs part of what they‚Äôre paid for.

The amount of aggression in the DMV area lately seems to be off the charts; aggression, in addition to incompetent, willfully-reckless, driving. 

I have to pull evasive maneuvers multiple times a day, *every day*, just to avoid accidents. Today around Hyattsville, I hit the jackpot as I had to slam my brakes to avoid being side-swiped, then the gas to avoid being rear-ended by the person who hadn‚Äôt paid attention to the whole scene. No more than 10 mins later, I had to slam my brakes again to avoid being side-swiped by someone who seemed to be attempting an insurance scam. Drove suspiciously slow, then veered in the lane I traveled as I tried to pass them (their car already had damage on the side that would be impacted if we‚Äôd collided).

So far I seem to be able to leave the stress of it all once I‚Äôm off the roads, but I wonder if all of this is sustainable for me at all

I‚Äôve already tried to leave the house between 11a and 2:30p (or 7:15p onwards at night), but it hinders me a lot. And even then, traffic seems to creep up into the times I used to be able to drive without too many cars on the road",1,2023,5,2,1,

OK, and where do you think the culture part comes from?

When Irish and Italian immigrants had little opportunity for big money jobs in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, they tended to join gangs. They decided at a young age that those gangs were the only realistic opportunities they had to acquire a position of status in their society.

The material conditions have a direct effect on a group's culture in a given community. The culture doesn't magically spring up out of nowhere.

When a 14 year old grows up in an area with a lot of asbestos ridden projects, bad schools, and drive-by shootings, THEN they are more likely to think that they have no chance to make it. If they see older siblings or role models not doing well, THEN there will be a greater tendency for them to think they have should just join a gang.

>According to the 2019 New York City NYC Government Poverty Measure, 23.8% of Asians are in poverty by municipal standards. This is the highest rate of all racial/ethnic groupings, which include White, Black, and Hispanic/Any.

Asian immigrants have a history of finding great success in the U.S. The parents persuade their children to believe that they can make it, and they have figures they can point to in order to prove their point.

You're the one making these claims. Where is the evidence?

I don't think it's particularly relevant to compare a smaller, self-selected subset of immigrants with broader racial groups. Undocumented immigrants have come specifically to work, and that's at great risk if they commit crimes.

>I'm not making an argument beyond the fact that we can't just handwave away crimes simply based on ""economic factors"" of the perpetrators.

What do you mean by disparity? Again your argument isn't very clear. If you're suggesting Asian Americans have better outcomes than African Americans because they work harder and have better cultural norms, then I disagree. First, ""[a substantial cohort of Asian Americans chose to come here and entered the United States with advanced degrees](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2017/04/andrew-sullivans-perpetuation-of-model-minority-and-black-pathology-myths-is-pretty-boring-at-this-point.html)."" This is a significant factor in the disparity.

Second, Asian Americans and African Americans have not had similar experiences in this country over the past 80 years or so. The premise of your argument seems to be that both have faced the same broad economic disadvantages, and therefore you can't blame economic factors when there's a disparity. However, isn't true. [For example](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2017/04/andrew-sullivans-perpetuation-of-model-minority-and-black-pathology-myths-is-pretty-boring-at-this-point.html):

>""During World War II, the media created the idea that the Japanese were rising up out of the ashes \[after being held in incarceration camps\] and proving that they had the right cultural stuff,"" said Claire Jean Kim, a professor at the University of California, Irvine. ""And it was immediately a reflection on black people: Now why weren't black people making it, but Asians were?""  
>  
>These arguments falsely conflate anti-Asian racism with anti-black racism, according to Kim. ""Racism that Asian-Americans have experienced is not what black people have experienced,"" Kim said. ""Sullivan is right that Asians have faced various forms of discrimination, but never the systematic dehumanization that black people have faced during slavery and continue to face today."" Asians have been barred from entering the U.S. and gaining citizenship and have been sent to incarceration camps, Kim pointed out, but all that is different than the segregation, police brutality and discrimination that African-Americans have endured.

Right now there is a lot of demand for house because people want single family homes out of harms way (if they have a job and the means) but that pool is limited so its reasonable to expect a big housing contraction in next year or so when things shake out but unemployment remains high. The real eviction crisis is only just starting given all the freezes. The landlords who are greedy and kick out all their tenants are going to find they have no way to fill their empty units; better to get an IOU that is enforceable at a lower rate than to have a empty unit now. If we are all lucky we might get a vaccine in Dec/Jan and really see it take hold by March and as the spring comes we might see things starting to return to normal and with that a big boom in jobs in the service sectors that got shut down if enough capital can be put out to jump start all those businesses.

The rental market for housing seems to be behaving somewhat similar to commercial/retail right now. 

Namely, from a business perspective, if you can swing debt service/maintenance/etc, especially for luxury/new construction, it usually makes sense to leave property empty than to rent for less.

One of the main reasons (and this is likely some of the fallout from DC's even more tenant friendly than normal actions during all of this), is that it's worth staying empty to find the right tenant.

Always has been. It's like buying a parking spot that comes with a car. The car is gonna always lose value, but you're speculating that the parking spot will appreciate in value by more than the car will lose.

I had a pretty sweet deal for my most recent rental before I bought a home, and would've stayed there long term had I not needed to upgrade in size. Every year that passed my lease fell further and further below market rates for comparable units in my building, to the point where I was essentially banking hundreds per month compared to buying a unit in the same building.

g50s5tg,iqqe85,,"No one here is arguing the right wants a civil war.  No one rational wants one.  The point is that a disputed election creates a prisoner's dilemma problem for both sides.  Everyone knows that a civil war is the worst outcome, but lack of trust can make steps toward it rational, until oops, both sides have gone too far and it happens.  

Relying on greed to stop the right is nuts.  In a disputed election neither rightwing leaders, nor, more importantly, their voters (whose opinions you are completely discounting - and most of them are not rich), are going to just roll over and let the Democrats have power.  Particularly when their leader, who has cult-like support from 40% of the country tells them they're being robbed.  So, Republican leaders will line up behind him, hoping that Dems roll over.  But Dems will actually be being robbed (if it comes to this) and their supporters will be outraged also, so they won't roll over.  The radical left will take to the streets, supported by protests the size of which dwarf anything this country has ever seen.  The radical right, armed, will come out in opposition to them, people will die, and the police and the military will get involved to try to quell the disturbances engulfing any place with large populations, or divided populations.  Given the degree the far right has infiltrated and co-opted many police departments and the military, they'll have a natural advantage.  On the other hand, military leaders will see Trump as dangerous and will recognize that he is ending democracy here...so who knows.  

The idea that this is certain to go badly is of course wrong - odds are the election isn't even close.  Or Trump could win legitimately.

Also, how this starts matters.  If Trump clearly lost, then yes, it's over like that no matter what he says because neither the military nor the rest of the executive branch will follow him, and at that point, seeing it's hopeless, Republicans in Congress will abandon him too.  

But if Trump is ahead on election night (because tons of Dems vote absentee), and there are some vote counting errors/disputes/very close key areas/credible allegations of hacking (in either direction), etc. - something that makes the election plausibly disputable, even if it's likely Biden won, then think what will happen:  Liberals will take to the streets, and some of them will be angry enough to break things, riot, etc. (a small minority probably, but it will be played up the Republicans and in media).  Trump will order the military out to restore order, and...MAYBE... a few military leaders will resign, but the military as a whole won't refuse to obey orders, because they won't clearly be illegal, unconstitutional, or an outright attempt to illegally hold on to power.  So the military will turn out.  That will enrage liberals more, and certain pro-violence types on all sides (not just liberals, but boogaloos, and rightwing terrorists) will either turn out to combat each other or as a false flag to increase support for a crackdown on liberal protestors.  Republicans will at the same time go to work in the courts to try to shutdown counting in a way that favors them, and their judicial appointees, already biased in favor of Republicans, and feeling the pressure of a nation in incredibly serious crisis will favor them with radical decisions that the judges justify to themselves with the need to resolve this quickly and decisively.

Democrats won't take this lying down, because, objectively, while the counts have not been completed or completed fairly, so no one knows for 100% who won the election, math suggests that Biden very likely did in the electoral college and did decisively in the popular vote.  Nancy Pelosi declares herself the legitimate President as of Jan. 21 until and if the vote counting can be fairly completed.  Trump and the Republicans have already claimed he won, or that, at a minimum, the House must decide the election between Trump and Biden, using the Constitutional procedure where each state gets one vote (and thus Trump would win, despite Dems having a majority of representatives).  

The idea that the military would definitely say with one voice ""Biden is President"" or ""Pelosi is President"" or ""Trump is President"" is wrong.  The situation I described is muddled and anyone can make an argument for their side.  The military doesn't simply go with Biden because he would be a better President - they've stumbled into a situation that they didn't want to be in, don't know what to do, don't know what orders are legitimate, don't know who should legitimately be giving them orders, and don't agree with themselves on any of it.",1,2020,9,2,1,

- [Stockton](https://www.neighborhoodscout.com/ca/stockton/crime) (12.59)

- [Baton Rouge](https://www.neighborhoodscout.com/la/baton-rouge/crime) (11.93)

That said, I'm getting a different list than they did because they used 2021 data. Which is why, when using UCR data, you typically want to pull five years of UCR data and average over the five years, because especially in smaller jurisdictions (which you'll note make up a lot of the cities listed) one year of higher crime due to some non-repeating factor (burglary spree, etc) can drive a city up in the rankings beyond its typical spot.

DC tenant laws are very strict. You will need to set up a business to rent out to tenants, it isn‚Äôt particularly difficult but it does cost money. You will also need to set up a way to process their rent, which unless they are paying check or cash, usually involves another cost.

ly8xbqu,1gvokxm,Independent_One2052,"Hello, I‚Äôm a DC realtor, lender, homeowner, and landlord.

First, TOPA - no it does not fall under TOPA anymore unless there are 4+ units or someone is elderly or disabled.  The law changed, whereas every tenant used to have topa rights and there was a bit of a process to comply with the law it is pretty simple now. You are required to send them a form notifying them if they are elderly or disabled they have TOPA rights but assuming they are not, that is all and as long as they do not assert their rights as elderly or disabled TOPA Is moot.

Second, programs.. yes the most common is DC‚Äôs HPAP .. however it is income restricted so if you make too much it would not be available.  The max income for a 2 person household to receive any assistance is $136,100 so if you gross over that it‚Äôs out.  If you are DC government employees there is the EAHP which offers less assistance but otherwise is the same program for DC employees and can be combined with HPAP.  The big downside to the HPAP is that it comes with the stipulation that the home remains your primary residence so if you want to upgrade or move away, selling is your only option to keep things on the up and up vs a normal loan you can move out and rent it and make it an investment property in the future.  The HPAP is also not a grant, but a deferred no interest loan so your initial payment will go up once the deferral period ends.  There are other programs out there, DC open doors, lender sponsored DPA, etc but what I tell people is generally there‚Äôs no free lunch.  If you have a minimum down payment and decent credit a traditional loan is usually the way to go.  The only exception to that ‚Äúno free lunch‚Äù rule is sometimes there are actual grants, they typically come with stipulations such as you must buy in certain zip codes, make under certain incomes etc to where they don‚Äôt work for most people.

FHA loans - generally the main downside of the FHA loans are the up front mortgage insurance which I tell clients ‚Äúare essentially points‚Äù.  The upfront premium is 1.75% and the minimum down payment for a standard fha loan is 3.5% so you put down 3.5% but initially owe 98.25%.  (There are 0% down options that come with lender overlays but the interest rate gets jacked up so most people find them unattractive unless the minimum down payment is truly not doable) Another downside is you cannot get rid of the monthly mortgage insurance without doing a refinance (unlike conventional loans).  This aspect is less of a detractor now than it was a couple years ago as everyone is expecting rates to drop and bring able to refinance, however, no guarantees .  Generally FHA loans are best for buyers with sub-700 credit that can‚Äôt get approved for conventional loans or where the rate is too high on conventional due to their fico or dti.

In terms of being a landlord DC Is very tenant friendly so my best advice is to always screen, screen, and screen some more for good tenants because a bad tenant can be a nightmare and nearly impossible to get out quickly and affordably.     It is far better to leave the rental vacant for a couple months and continue searching for a quality tenant than to rent it to the first sub par applicant that comes along IMO.  

 In terms of keeping everything on the ‚Äúup and up‚Äù you will need a rental license (BBL) from the city if the basement is an entirely separate unit.  If it is a completely separate unit and the current owner does not have a BBL it‚Äôs an ‚Äúillegal rental‚Äù which sounds scary but honestly the city generally is not cracking down on them, however it could still bite you if you need to take the tenant to court.  In fact since it appears the whole house is rented there really should be a minimum of 1 BBL, if not 2 depending how the house and leases are configured.  There could be a reason such as ceiling height below 7‚Äô, lack of egress or another reason it can‚Äôt be approved.. just so you‚Äôre aware.  A lot of government/military are very concerned with having everything legal so otherwise identical houses, one with a legal basement rental and the other with an illegal basement rental can be valued a bit differently.. so it affects marketability.  Separate utility metering is another item that most basement rentals do not have but improves value if it does.

To legally rent out your basement apartment in DC, you‚Äôll need two things:

1. **Basic Business License (BBL).**¬†This is a document that basically ensures the safety of both you and your renter by giving you the right to do business (yes, even if you‚Äôre just operating as a landlord in your own home!).
2. **Certificate of Occupancy.**¬†This is a document that verifies your unit is safe for renting. To obtain this certificate, you‚Äôll need to have your basement pass inspection; otherwise, your rental will be considered illegal. You must have a Certificate of Occupancy before you can get a BBL.

To pass inspection, your basement apartment will need a few things. First, the ceilings will need to be at least seven feet high (for habitable spaces), have two ways of safely exiting the apartment, and have separate heating and cooling.

ly3rr1i,1gvokxm,th3m00s3,"Few thoughts: 

1) DC has a suite of first time homebuying programs with varying restrictions and hoops to jump through. I purchased through DC Open Doors about 5 years back. I've heard it isn't as great of a deal now, but I really don't know enough. Some banks also offer promotional, first-time home buyer loans that are portfolio loans (as opposed to conventional vs. FHA), depending on things like the census tract you're buying in. Talk to a mortgage lender who is familiar with all these programs-- I recommend someone at First Home Mortgage.

2) I don't think the tenant in your ADU actually qualifies for TOPA tenant rights, but I could be wrong here.

**Howard University**

* Shaw is walkable, but it can be hard to find something affordable

* Columbia Heights is vibrant and more affordable, but it‚Äôs a bit of a walk to campus

**Catholic University of America**

* Silver Spring is just up the Red Line and has a lot of what you‚Äôre looking for

* NoMa is the same in the opposite direction, but is a little more connected to the rest of the city

**George Washington University**

* Foggy Bottom has lots of good housing options

* West End is basically overflow for Foggy Bottom, so check there too

* I know people who go to GW and live in Crystal City, Rosslyn, or even Tysons for the cost and community, so if commuting is your thing then maybe consider those

**Georgetown University**

* Foxhall Village is close if you can find a place

* Living in Georgetown proper is your best bet here, despite the cost, simply due to how difficult it is to commute

**University of the District of Columbia**

* Bethesda is a good option because of metro access

* Adams Morgan is a little pricy but could be a good place to look

**Gallaudet University**

* NoMa is super close and a nice place

* Near Northeast has a bunch of stuff, and the closer to H Street or 8th Street the better

Mainly in NE (but some buildings in NW on the other side of N. Capitol St) I‚Äôd check out the NOMA, Union Market and H St areas.

And in SE/SW I‚Äôd check out the Navy Yard and area west down to the Wharf.

We live on 20th, and it is very, very quiet, hardly any foot or car traffic except for locals. 19th Street seems to be a little nosier since it is the entrance to the neighborhood from the bus and street car, it is also a through street up to Maryland avenue; also 19th and Benning is a pretty active corner. Our neighbors are very friendly and are mix of an older generation who have lived here for years and a younger generation moving in. 

We frequently go out on H street and feel safe walking to the street car or bus to go out. However like some already mentioned we almost always grab an uber/lyft home instead of walking home from the street car when we stay out late at night.

We do hear the occasional gun shots at night, but they are usually east on 21st Street. We feel we got good value for the home we bought compared to similar size houses in neighborhoods we could no longer afford.

>Abstract

>Noise is unwanted and/or harmful sound, first recognized as a public health hazard in 1968. The Noise Control Act of 1972 declared that ‚Äúit is the policy of the United States to promote an environment for all Americans free from noise that jeopardizes their health or welfare.‚Äù The promise of that legislation remains unfulfilled 50 years later. Human exposure to harmful noise levels is widespread. Major sources include transportation, military aircraft and combat operations, noisy recreational vehicles, industrial machinery, recreational and leisure activities, outdoor power equipment, consumer products, and, possibly, wind turbines. Loud noise causes hearing loss and tinnitus and can contribute to non-auditory health problems. Chronic noise, even at low levels, can cause annoyance, sleep disruption, and stress that contribute to cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, metabolic disturbances, exacerbation of psychological disorders, and premature mortality. Noise interferes with cognition and learning, contributes to behavior problems, and reduces achievement and productivity. The health of more than 100 million Americans is at risk, with children among the most vulnerable. Noise-related costs range in the hundreds of billions of dollars per year. Yet, the United States has no federal standards for non-occupational noise exposure. Federal standards for occupational noise exposure from the 1970s address only hearing loss as an adverse health effect and do not apply to all workers (e.g., those in agriculture and construction). Calls for action have gone largely unheeded.",24,2022,3,2,1,

i1vkvjd,tkyf41,saltyjohnson,"I agree with you generally, except FAA regs tend to avoid the word ""shall"" when it comes to dictating how a pilot operates their aircraft. FAA regs are very clear that the [pilot in command is the final authority as to the operation of their aircraft](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-91#p-91.3(a)). Even if a pilot deviates from a direct instruction from ATC, the only thing that the pilot ""shall"" do is notify ATC of the deviation and their next intentions as soon as possible. That's not to say that there won't be disciplinary actions taken against the pilot if an investigation finds that the deviation wasn't prudent, but that stuff waits until the pilot is on the ground so they can focus on operating their aircraft.

Thus, ""expected to"" is nearly equivalent to the word ""shall"" except that it leaves the window open for the pilot to deviate if they feel it's necessary. ""Expected to"" means that if ATC clears you to operate along a given route and does not state a specific altitude, you are cleared to operate at the maximum altitude charted. Again, if the pilot feels they must deviate for some reason, they are within their rights to do so. ""Shall"" would be more appropriate in the case of ""A pilot shall not enter prohibited area P-56"" because if you violate that direction, you're liable to be subject to lethal force. However, 14 CFR 73 still doesn't even say ""shall not"", rather sticking with what I'd think to be less severe [""you may not""](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-E/part-73/subpart-C/section-73.83) language.",4,2022,3,2,1,

Third, here are all the bills she‚Äôs written this Congress. What‚Äôs noticeable is how few cosponsors she has - zero on the vast majority. As a jaded staffer, I‚Äôm not critiquing her for not passing laws or having a ton of support - but no support? None? It‚Äôs because she does slap dash, piss poor policy that not even your most liberal members touch. Effective lawmakers are able to convince some of their colleagues to support their ideas, surely. https://www.congress.gov/quick-search/legislation?wordsPhrases=&wordVariants=on&congressGroups%5B%5D=0&congresses%5B%5D=117&legislationNumbers=&legislativeAction=&sponsor=on&representative=N000147&senator=

I‚Äôm not seeing ‚Äúideas‚Äù here - I‚Äôm seeing her just throwing spaghetti at the wall. 

EHN is on the Oversight Committee and the Transportation committee. These are not ‚Äúpowerful‚Äù committees like Ways & Means or Energy & Commerce. You can make the argument for Oversight but I‚Äôll rebut by saying their major piece of legislation has been about the post office (while needed, not powerful.)

And her chair on Transportation subcommittee- everyone knows DeFazio runs that committee in full. There‚Äôs no real power there. 

EHN just votes with Democrats. Anyone the district elects is going to have the exact same record. She, in theory, could raise more hell by not being a rubber stamp Dem in committee - but she‚Äôs literally never done that.

Most EHN supporters parrot her line about being rated as one of the most effective lawmakers as rated by the Center for Effective Lawmaking which uses really just one measure of success - how many bills did you support that have passed into law? 

EHN is number one because she signs onto a large, large majority of bills in Congress. Right now, she‚Äôs signed onto nearly 1500 bills. 

For context here‚Äôs how many other ‚Äúfamous‚Äù members have signed onto: Jayapal - 514. Sean Patrick Maloney - 230. Katie Porter - 382. Raskin - 621. Tlaib-524.

We included some of your comments in this story. Here's a little preview of our list, written by Sophia Solano:***

Perhaps more than anything else in this fractured world, pizza is a point of consensus. It‚Äôs perfect for a kid‚Äôs birthday bash or an on-the-go lunch between calls, as well-suited to grace a silver platter at a fancy cocktail party as it is plopped on a paper towel for a whirl in the microwave. Everyone, it seems, can agree on pizza.

Unless you live in D.C.

Around here, pizza is very, very divisive.

Our city ‚Äî littered with New York and Midwestern transplants who have strong opinions on what makes a respectable pie ‚Äî has never gained a reputation as a great pizza town. While other cities get entire styles named in their honor, we get the crumbs.

Despite all that, there is truly great pizza in the DMV ‚Äî if you know where to look. We set out on a journey to find it, with our readers at the wheel.

What follows is a list of the best pizza joints in the Washington area, based on the opinions that matter most: those of our readers. Next time you‚Äôre hungry for pizza, seek out one of these shops. Their pies are as delicious as they come; we‚Äôre sure you‚Äôll agree.

***20: We, the Pizza***

The original Capitol Hill shop, frequented by school and tour groups, has grown to include We, the Pizza locations as near as Arlington and as far as Clearwater Beach, Fla. In addition to dozens of dining options (including a divisive honey ham and pineapple pie), the sodas are crafted with homemade syrups, and the Ballston location offers gelato shakes.

‚ÄúWe The Pizza is my favorite,‚Äù wrote one Reddit user. ‚ÄúTheir Ultimate Cheese \[tomato sauce, fontina, taleggio and mozzarella\] with the pesto oil drizzle makes my heart all a-flutter.‚Äù

***19: Jumbo Slice Pizza Mart***

There‚Äôs a misconception among the young and, well, drunk that ‚Äújumbo slice‚Äù refers to any of the several pizza joints dotting the streets of Adams Morgan after midnight on a weekend. It‚Äôs no wonder ‚Äî the term even has its own Wikipedia page. But only one restaurant, if you‚Äôre kind enough to call it so, actually holds the name ‚ÄúJumbo Slice.‚Äù Whether our polled readers referred to that stop or its greasily delicious posers remains a mystery. Even those who jumped into a discussion on the best Washington pizza expressed some ambiguity: ‚ÄúI think Jumbo Slice, right?‚Äù wrote a Reddit user who asked to be identified as Mike D. ‚ÄúOr is it just because it‚Äôs usually 2 a.m. when I‚Äôm eating it? I don‚Äôt really know.‚Äù

***18: Della Barba***

Most pizzerias stick to making just one or two styles of pie. But Della Barba, a former Union Kitchen start-up, proves that more options does not mean less attention to detail. Founder (and former defense attorney) Joey Barber offers four types of pies in the styles native to Detroit, New York, Chicago and your own oven, otherwise known as ‚Äúnonna‚Äù or ‚Äúgrandma-style.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt sleep on the nonna crust,‚Äù wrote Post reader Karen Wilson Roman. ‚ÄúBut all the crusts are delicious.‚Äù

jyp3wp3,1678db3,,"Thoughts as a self-professed pizza guy who's had most of the pizza on this list at one time or another:

1. Omission of Slice Joint undermines the credibility of the list (disclaimer: I've never had it, but everyone I know that has had said it's #2 after Andy's in DC, if not #1).
2. Omission of Red Light (over Emmy Squared) for their Detroit Style pizza is a subjective borderline objective mistake.
3. 2 Amy's is overrated but good Neapolitan.
4. Pupatella at 6th is (I think pretty subjectively) baffling, just cannot understand why people like Pupatella it's been extremely mediocre and floppy every time I've had it.
5. Ledo's deserves to be 7th.
6. Martha Dear and Gracie Nonna should have been on this list (maybe also Sonny's).",6,2023,9,2,1,

I think the main issue with DC bagels is that they are often too white in appearance (whether that is them being under baked or not boiled long enough, IDK).\* Other minor differences I've noticed is that maybe ours are too dry as dough - the best NYC bagels I've had are still very good untoasted b/c the interior is moist and plump. The latter is maybe the only other difference I've noticed - some of our bagels are somewhat flat and look like there's a combination of too little dough and/or not enough leavening. People there also think the specific water they use is a big deal, but my palate isn't sensitive enough to detect that subtle of a difference.

\*Exception here is maybe Bagel Uprising in Del Ray, which has more like a bread crust exterior, but that's also different from what I'm talking about.

Does this mean that it's okay to hurl racial epithets at Asian folks? No, it doesn't. But racism or more precisely white supremacy attempts to leverage Asians against Black folks through the ""model minority"" myth and seeks to play us off of each other. 

In this way, a number of Asian folks (not all) are able to benefit from their relative proximity to whiteness and as part of this tradeoff frequently dabble in antiblackness. 

I suggest the folks in this thread talking about how in DC Black folks are ""the most racist"" would learn a lot from actually reading social science research/theory on white supremacy and bias instead of parroting the white supremacist talking points that come so easily to mind.

I had a similar incident when a man started to speed walk down the escalator to stand just right beside me. He then tried to raise his arm in front of me, holding a bag of some sort in his hand. When I noticed this I took a quick look back only to see him staring at me without saying a single word. Creepy as fuck.

I'm sure now that it's probably a case of mental illness, and really god knows what he would've done if I waited any longer. I threw away all pretext of civility and just booked it down the escalator and reported him to the first station agent I saw. The guy then finally started talking and raised a huge attitude about ""whatever the hell"" I had told the station agent. 

I managed to slip away as the station agent tried to calm down the man in order to defuse the situation, but it was very disturbing.

Regardless, the person who scratched the car showed lack of respect for another persons property. Why not just leave a note venting whatever they have to say instead of etching in their car?

What ProTimFanning said is exactly what I was going to say to your question. With body panels being made out of fiberglass, aluminum, and carbon fiber (such as Z06) it is a much tougher process to correct dents and scratches. Sometimes when dealing with things like carbon fiber it just is not fixable.  Also, nowadays most body shops just replace the whole body panel instead of trying to do paint correction for deep scratches to bare metal or really bad dents.

If you want to learn more about the process of fixing a keyed car this video is very in depth and good. If you don't watch the whole video the first two mins should give you an idea the labor intensive process of fixing something like this.

hs8t0qu,s1dcqo,ManitouWakinyan,"The specificity is important - to some degree, it makes sense that a decision-maker might be biased against pursuing charges because an institution they are deeply connected to is at risk. As we start getting farther away from that, the bias starts to make less sense, or be less impactful. Are you really saying that Kanter is refusing to pursue charges because some of his staff are alumni of the institutions that are breaking the law? And if so, who is that? His deputies? One of them has a UPenn degree, sure - but the one in charge of criminal enforcement has his JD from the University of Alabama. Maybe his Director of Enforcement. She got her BA from UPenn, yes - but her JD is from Tulane. Or maybe the chief of the Civil Operations unit, who has degrees from Catholic and Trinity. 

Basically:

1. Civil servants have a lower rate of top-ranked universities than you'd expect (most of those graduates go into the private sector)
2. Contrary to what you said, not every relevant leader here went to an elite university - relatively few of them did, particularly in this administration
3. Even as we consider that there might be a lot of staff, kids, etc. who go or went to Ivy Leagues, the proposed bias gets weaker and weaker. I don't know about you, but if I were a lawyer in the antitrust division, and we were pursuing a lawsuit against the alma mater that I owed a few grand in student loans to, I wouldn't hesitate to bring the hammer down. Of course, I doubt my boss or bosses' boss would care. And given ethical rules, I'd expect that if my son went to a university we were targeting, I wouldn't be placed on that case. 
4. This doesn't mean that universities don't know how to protect themselves, or that they don't have powerful lobbyists. I think the basic point that elite universities are well-connected and resourced, and that helps protect them is a good one. But I think you can make that point without resorting to sweeping generalizations and untrue claims. My hope is that this pushback lets you strengthen your point in future, and helps sharpen the case against the kind of behavior these schools are being sued over.",6,2022,1,2,1,
hsac1iv,s1dcqo,superdookietoiletexp,"I would be interested in seeing it play out. There is a very cosy relationship between the upper echelons of the US government and elite universities, particularly the policy schools that routinely hand out sinecures to newly unemployed politicians and their advisors between cycles. Whether that affects decisions made at DoJ is a moot point, I agree. The lobbying is probably more of a factor; another perhaps even more powerful is the role that HYPS et al. (and their reputation) serve in the projection of American soft power. Ultimately, it would be a very brave prosecutor in any administration other than Trump's that decided to take down their false claims to some meritocratic ideal.

> ""We feel that we ... have been absolutely abandoned by the city,"" McDonnell had written in his email. ""The crime and safety issues in that neighborhood are out of control.""
***
> In the original email, McDonnell detailed how his employees had been punched, pepper sprayed, had guns and knives pulled on them, spit on, and had to watch as ""customers have literally tried to kill each other."" He added that one of their employee's sons, who worked nearby, was robbed and murdered ‚Äì leaving his team distraught about the loss and about the situation in the neighborhood.

> ""All of the above needs to be understood in the context of the lack of police presence. There is none,"" McDonnell wrote. ""Once upon a time there was. 911 calls, if they come at all, take 15-20 minutes. When they do arrive, it seems as if they feel they can‚Äôt do anything.""

After WUSA9 found out about this and contacted the management, the management released a public letter saying it was happy with how it's addressing this. In the best case scenario, crime was actually terrible but Clyde's is genuinely happy with the efforts to address that. In the worst, the private communication is how Clyde's actually feels, and the statement of praise that was released immediately after the September letter was a face saving measure (perhaps not to upset the government, perhaps not to scare away patrons). If you're going by the idea that we can't trust what corporations are saying publicly, as it's just a way for them to get public opinion to go in the direction they want, I'm not sure why you'd trust the public letter over the private communication.

Chokeholds have always been against MPD policy but the most recent policy re-iterating that has made it against the law to have incidental neck touches. This doesn‚Äôt specify an intended neck touch, but instead, any touch of the neck inducing pressure on them with no measure of degree. This includes pulling of a shirt, brushing against the neck, or any other incidental action causing contact with the neck. This results in an administrative actions putting the members career at risk, a trial board, the member at possibility of criminal charges, and more. A lot of members have already faced suspension over such incidental touches while this most recent policy has been enacted. So why put hands on anyone to effect an arrest or a stop? Why risk your life when almost every other bit of the system is working against law and order?

People have been suspended for this left and right, and it‚Äôs not for what you claim. People get fired or charged for that kind of negligence resulting in death in DC.

The current owner, a speculator, probably snatched this house up for, maybe, $100 grand and hasn't looked at it since.  It's in a not-bad neighborhood, just off S. Dakota Ave., 3 blocks from RI Ave.  It's on a huge lot. It has the potential for adding up and out. The owner is obviously open to offers but Zillow says the payments on the asking price would run $2,300 a month for a two bedroom, two bath house. If it was pretty that would be an attractive purchase for a rental. Except it's not pretty. But I don't see deterioration, just, so far, neglect.

The tipping factor is, of course, the down payment. For the sake of argument lets say the seller will take $400 grand. If so, there's your 20%, on paper, down payment.

If the current market could be considered constant this might be a good investment at $400 grand. But, in my opinion, it's not. The entire area is in a bubble. However, if I had bought it at $100 I'd feel safe as, well, houses.",2,2022,3,2,1,

i0i5rdt,tcxuqv,punkwalrus,"One of my old school chums lived on a property built in the 1920s-30s next to a farm. Back then, it was a cheap parcel of land, a fews acres at most. In the 1950s, the farm around them sold and was developed into a post-war suburban neighborhood, with the standard quarter acre lots. They were smack dab in the middle of where the development wanted to build a road, but they refused, and so one of our main neighborhood streets abruptly ended at the edge of of their property, now heavily wooded, and containing two houses. 

By the late 1980s, the neighborhood started to be gentrified, and as the homes sold off, were razed to the ground and McMansions put in their place. Now about half my old neighborhood are huge homes that are built almost right up to the property line with barely any yard space to speak of. My school chum's parents eventually sold off the property they lived on for some ungodly amount of money based on property alone.  I think several million per acre.

In terms of safety you will be fine unless you decide to get drunk and go wander the back streets flashing $100 bills.

So, yeah there is stuff to do nearby but it isn't very unique to DC outside from the clientele. The baseball stadium is there so you could watch the Nats season continue to go down the tubes in one of the better MLB parks. In terms of more interesting food I'd check out Eastern Market which is not far away. Just about any other part of town is a 15-30 minute metro/uber away, you aren't staying in outer Mongolia.

Where the fuck did I say that?  I'm just not stupid enough to think that giving a junkie a minimum wage job will magically cure them of addiction.  For a lot of people, they're homeless precisely because they're addicts and can't hold a job.  These are the same sort of people who need free narcan that the city provides.

>Do you have semblance of an idea on what personal responsibility means in this world? On what being an adult is? And that yes, eventually, decisions have consequences?

I think you're inferring something from my post that I never said nor ever meant.

My point was that giving a junkie a job and a roof over their head won't do anything.  Junkies either are homeless because they became too addicted and couldn't hold a job or they became homeless through other factors, became addicted to drugs to cope and now can't hold a job.  A lot of these addicts likely don't even want a job, you can't give someone something they don't even want.  I don't know what the solution is because I don't care enough to figure one out, if I had one, I'd run for office.

These people won't become productive members of society until they get clean and/or get treated for their severe mental illness (a person who yells and talks to themselves can't hold a job either...also, and I'm going on a hunch here, they likely wouldn't want a job anyway).

It's about a constant stream of it over a significant period of time. They themselves are blocking and slowing down traffic, while also endangering every car, driver, cyclist, and pedestrian near them.

Agree that traffic sucks, but there have already been proposals to regulate/charge a toll for access to downtown DC, like they do for central London, to reduce traffic and promote pedestrian access/bicycle usage. So that's why I suggested those options.

Yes, police chases have caused rider deaths, which is why police chases were banned.

But since the car chase ban, there have been multiple incidents of pedestrians being killed or maimed as well as car accidents all caused by illegal off-road vehicle drivers.

I agree with you about the chaos aspect. I don't think they would get as much joy from this if there wasn't the potential danger of getting arrested or intimidating/interrupting other people.

Unfortunately, after all the articles/posts I've read about this issue, I actually do not think that people smarter than us, lawmakers or otherwise, have actually tried to do anything about this. That's what I'm particularly incensed about.

Regarding the traffic cameras, it's the only way that MPD can track down the offenders because of the no chase policy. From what I've read, around 50%+ of these off road vehicles are actually stolen, so it's the only way they can enforce the law. The act of riding illegally in DC streets is a misdemeanor and carries up to a $250 fine (but no one's ever been fined that much), and if they can't pay the $50-$150 that they're typically fined, then it comes with up to a 12 day stint in DC jail, which is again waived because it's a misdemeanor and DC Jails are way overstuffed.

So, if we had the cameras, at minimum we can hope to confiscate illegal/stolen off-roading vehicles.

Gun control will make it a bit harder for criminals to get a gun, and would bring harsher mandatory sentences upon those who use guns for violent crimes.

ie27b79,vmknzh,,"The point of movements like ""defund the police"" is not to eliminate those resources, but to redirect those funds into social programs that are shown to help reduce crime, such as  social services, youth services, housing, education, healthcare, etc.  For example, if a cop performs a welfare check instead of a social worker, there's a much greater risk of that check turning into a violent altercation.  Or if someone tries to pass a counterfeit $50 bill, a cop being called means they might be shot when the situation escalates.  As a society, we often default to police-based policies, but there are many other options that could help address people's issues without introducing a cop that often defaults to escalation and violence.  

""Defund the Police"" refers to a number of specific policy proposals that are based on the finding--that you seem to readily agree with--that merely increasing the budget of police is *not* shown to [reduce crime](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/06/07/over-past-60-years-more-spending-police-hasnt-necessarily-meant-less-crime/).

I had a cop friend who worked in SE DC and I found out there are no transfers or regular movements between precincts, and eventually the danger and discouragement was too much for him so he moved to suburban PA. I highly recommend that if you're in that situation. 

I just don't think these posts contribute, esp when they're complaining about single party rule. The other party, I presume, the Republican Party's current 'state of the art' policy prescription is to legalize concealed handguns and legalize murder if you feel threatened, and killings have gone up more in those areas. NYC is actually safer than much of the nation, back to the 'gentrification' point.

I'm open to policy discussion - shouldn't DC police be moved around so the best cops are exposed to the worst areas and the worse cops are exposed to non-friends? , or other specifics (surveillance cameras, different policing methods) but I never see that when a specific crime is called out.

ie2qf9i,vmknzh,capcityff918,"I definitely don't disagree with everything you're saying.  DC is not going through the same issues at they were in the 90s, as the murder capital.  DC has been gentrifying for some time now and the homicide rate dropped quickly.  However, it's still gentrifying and the rate is rising again.  Like I said, 88 homicides in 2012.  It's been rising for a decade now.  226 last year and this year looks to be worse.  So the rate is definitely trending in the wrong direction.  Could it be safe again in 10 years?  Absolutely.  Though I still see it getting worse before it gets better.

I don't know too much about police assignments, as I'm on the fire side.  In fire, we have no choice on where we are placed, but  we can request transfers.  This results in a lot of younger guys transferring to fire houses east of the river, Trinidad, Shaw, Columbia Heights, Petworth, or where the action is.  They want the experience and are very excited about their job.  Areas in upper NW, like Georgetown or the Palisades, are commonly filled with older guys trying to slow down.

As far as policy to aide in this, I have no idea where to even start.  It's not something I'm very knowledgeable about and I'll never claim to be.  This younger generation is much different though.  The crime in the 90s was in many major cities hit hard by the crack epidemic.  Now, there seems to be a lot more random shootings over minor issues.

The simple truth is the original movement, including its name, was birth on the streets in radical activist circles.

All I read is how awful the local govt is without specifics, how much they're not spending on what you personally want because you're right about everything, and everyone upvoting  the moral outrage that 'nothing is being done'. I even offered a specific policy that DC govt could try and you didn't respond.

I'm truly sorry for these tragedies, but complaining about the DC govt because of another random shooting before there is even a conviction is the height of stupid groupthought.

Neither do I think that legalizing hidden handguns and self-defense shootings will lead to fewer deaths - and the data back me up. 

After 4 decades of mass incarceration, you don't feel safe, then you're never going to feel safe, and we have plenty of evidence that the issue is Republican policies, not the mayor of DC.

‚Äî Dupont/Kalorama ‚âà Kensington/Notting Hill. With upscale row houses and home to most of the embassies, this is a relatively peaceful/upscale area. Tons of restaurants, bars, shops, and a weekly farmers market kinda gives DuPont a notting hill vibe.

‚Äî Adams Morgan (AdMo) ‚âà Camden. AdMo is pretty hipster/offbeat for DC standards (though not at the level of Takoma Park), with its main stretch on 18th street featuring a wide mix of shops, restaurants, and nightlife. 

‚Äî U Street/Shaw ‚âà Shoredtich. Lots of bars. Like AdMo, this is a top destination for young people to go out on weekends. Good place for live music as well with several of DC‚Äôs top venues (9:30 club, Lincoln Theater).

‚Äî Georgetown ‚âà Knightsbridge. Very posh, known for the University and it being DC‚Äôs shopping hub. With its variety of stores, also reminiscent of SoHo.

‚Äî NoMa/H Street Cordidor ‚âà Brixton. An interesting mix of grit with new developments. Street art and interesting restaurants give the area a creative energy. Also home to Union Market (the closest thing DC has to Borough/Camden). 

‚Äî Navy Yard ‚âà Canary Wharf. Brand new and a little ways out, feels very different from the rest of DC. Surging in development of apartment complexes and restaurants/bars. Not known for being a business hub like Canary Wharf, though; it‚Äôs the home to the Washington Nationals (city‚Äôs baseball team)",56,2021,11,2,1,
hkvn0ha,qv8awv,leffbehind,"Hi OP! As someone who moved from London to DC after grad school I hope I can give you a good perspective of everything here in DC. 

1. DC is *significantly smaller* than London. Anyone who has been to NYC/LA/SF will also tell you this, but from one seat of government to another, you will quickly realize that DC is a tiny fraction of the size of London. However, what's nice is that DC (in some areas) actually seems quite dense and slightly similar to European cities.
2. Public Transit will be good - in the context of transit in the US. European cities have decades of developed infrastructure for folks who don't have cars and the US is very much the opposite. DC however is one of the most walkable cities in the US and there are a host of different public transit options, as long as you are not to snobby to ride the bus (Moving from London where I bussed or tube everywhere I never understood some DC residents' need to turn their nose up at the busses.)
3. For your budget you will have plenty of options and, I would also aim for the West End (not much there, and a bit too close to college students at GW)/Dupont/Kalorama/Adam's Morgan/west of Logan Circle axis. These areas are *relatively* low crime, quiet, walkable, have plenty of shoppes and eateries, and you can meet new people. **However, noise level varies extremely based on the individual unit and the street(s) that it faces.** This is not satisfying, unless you have a buddy here already, but if you can - **tour the unit and linger as long as you can** ***in the unit*** **to accurately gauge the noise level of the individual unit.** I currently live in a building with a gorgeous unit that faces one of the loudest street corners in DC and will be moving next month out of Columbia Heights because of it - yet folks who live on the other side of the building have quiet and serene living spaces.
4. What may appear odd to you and will seem normal to most Americans is how DC, an urban city, has a *completely random arrangement of completely residential blocks* interspersed throughout the city (things like Swann St. NW). These are very cute and if you can manage to find a ground floor (not basement) unit in one of these in your price range, that is the golden ticket.
5. The weather is similar, but on the whole, better than London. The amount of days where it just lightly rains all day long (my most hated part of London) is relatively small. Summers in DC will be more humid and a bit hotter, and I'd actually say the winters are comparable. In general about 15-30% less rain and it's usually harder and quicker in duration.
6. Lots of churches, like, a lot, even considering that London has been inhabited since Roman times, DC has probably 20x the churches of London
7. Dogs Dogs Dogs - DC has very quickly become a city of dog-owners. This is I think a relatively recent advent in DC greatly accelerated by COVID, but there will be many many more dogs here, which I as a pet owner, love.
8. DC residents think they have a lot of rats/mice - they have never lived in London :D.
9. Do not believe anyone who says an ""Irish Bar/pub"" is good in DC, I am yet to find one.
10. U St. is generally too loud and busy, but there are quiet bubbles to be found. 
11. NoMa is still being gentrified/redeveloped in a piecemeal fashion so certain parts of it are very modern (and people love it) and other parts are very urban blight/empty lots/crime - and *it is far from the various other centers of DC young/exciting/interesting life except for the H St. corridor/Eastern Market.* 
12. Now I'll also give you an additional random list of trade offs:
   1. Higher Priced items in DC: 
      1. Theatre/Events tickets - Yes there are opportunities to get free/cheap tickets with good seats, but I went to a massive amount of plays, ballets, musicals, concerts, etc. in London for a nice chunk cheaper than here in DC. 
      2. Gym memberships - These are treated like a luxury good in DC and while there are some that have various tiers of pricing, you will likely get a bit of sticker shock - When I lived in London a new gym opened within 1-3 tube stops every 4-5 months, making pricing competitive. Gyms in DC are run/owned by about 4-6 companies who have no incentive to have competitive pricing (Avoid WSC if you can) -
      3. Healthcare - I will not bore you with the details, but it's a lot more expensive and it's something **you will need to budget for** unless you work at a tech company that pays all your premiums (this is rare, but happens)
   2. Cheaper items in DC
      1. Museums - London is good, but I'd argue that DC's got it beat on the massive volume of free museums/art galleries and the like
      2. **Housing - what you can afford for 2500 in DC will be palatial, modern, clean and in a great neighborhood compared to London flats.**
      3. Groceries - The difference here is not large, but it is enough that you will notice your spend at Harris Teeter/Safeway/Giant is probably slightly cheaper than your standard London Tesco. This scales so M&S prices>Trader Joes, Waitrose prices>Whole Foods
      4. **Utilities - these bills are A LOT cheaper in the US**

hkvdv7e,qv8awv,emcee_gee,"I'm the same age as you are. I moved here in August and had the same budget. I do have a car, but I only use it on road trips; not for commuting or other regular activities. I bike and walk a lot and take the Metro when I go in to work. I had visited DC a handful of times over the last decade or so, so I already had a decent idea of the neighborhood vibes.

I chose the U Street area. Not _on_ U Street -- that would be too crazy/loud for me at this point in my life. But close enough that I still get the benefit of all the businesses and nightlife when I want to go out. I chose a condo building that wasn't _super_ new and didn't have all the flashy amenities, but had a relatively strong community of grown adults.

I'd recommend finding a Realtor to help you find a place. They don't generally work with the big property management firms; instead, they help you find individual condos listed by smaller landlords usually with only one or two units (often, places they themselves used to live). I've always been happier renting from individuals than companies; plus, with a Realtor, you get the benefit of having someone who takes the time to get to know you and what you're looking for, rather than having a bunch of 15-minute tours with different listing agents where you've got to ask all the same questions every time and you never really know how honest they're being. Realtors work on commission, generally taking the first month's rent from the landlord, so it doesn't cost you anything.

Skip NoMa unless living in a cheap new-ish apartment is important above all else (location, safety, etc.).  I don‚Äôt care for Mount Vernon Triangle, but if living in a new-ish building is important then you should consider it.  U Street is ok depending on where you‚Äôre talking about specifically, but if you mean actually on  U street it can be loud because there‚Äôs a lot of bars.  If you mean on 14th north of U I suggest you walk around at night and decide if you feel safe.  It can be really sketchy at night and during the day, and there‚Äôs a surprising amount of crime.  14th below U is totally fine.

Skip Foggy Bottom and also West End unless you‚Äôre fine living nearly exclusively with college and grad students.  Don‚Äôt think you can avoid college students by living in an expensive building.

I work 3 blocks over (Farragut Square area). It's not feasible by walking, but I recommend Alexandria Old Town if bicycling is an option. Has metro access direct to DC, is very, very safe, cute cafes, gorgeous Old Town that reminds me a lot of the U.K. (it was a British colonial city after all), vibrant King Street with lots of restaurants and rowhomes. It's an urban city and feels like an extension of Washington, D.C., but still has that ""Hot Fuzz"" charm. It's the crown jewel of the metro area imo (though I moved out since it was getting DC-levels of expensive).

Honestly, Mount Vernon Triangle, U Street, and Noma are all recently-converted-transitional neighborhoods, so the ""urban frontier"" won't be too far away at any given point. So they may feel sketchy if you turn the wrong corner. Logan Circle is the gay district of D.C. It's a small cute district, but very expensive. Not sure if you swing that way, but if so, it's a great place to be (Dupont Circle is the former LGBT district, but now is for older gays + diplomats - since it abuts Embassy Row).

I avoid Uber like the plague unless a dire situation (and because two drivers pulled up, my teen daughter put her hand on the door handle - I was behind her - and the driver sped off and cancelled the ride. Couldn't even complain.)

I figured out - and might be dissimilar to your situation - that Lyft has this ""priority service"" that is an outright scam. 

* For example, ""Pick up in 5 minutes, $17. Pick up in 10, $14. Pick up in 20, $10."" Except that if I pick 5 minutes, it can still take 15 and they charge me $20. If I pick 10 minutes, it can come in 5 minutes for $15...or in 20 minutes and they charge $15. Or I pick $20 and it comes in 5 minutes and I'm charged $17. There is absolutely no rhyme or reason. To me, this seems like it is against contract law. Can a store say, ""1 pound of tomatos for $5"" then you get to the cash register and it's $10?? No, that's illegal. Advertised price is advertised price. 
* The ride cancelling is RIFE. Sometimes I have had my ride cancelled 2-3 times before a driver actually comes. And I still pay more than advertised!  A couple years ago I missed two planes because of this. I left 2.5 hours before my flight at DCA and twice didn't make it because of the cancelled rides! Zero possibility to complain as there is no ride or driver to link the complaint to.

Another reason I am straight up Empower, Curb or regular taxi now. Empower might take a bit longer, but the drivers keep all fares except like $100 subscription fee a month.

The other thing is that a couple times I treated myself to a ""Luxury"" Lyft driver and they were all the worst, rudest drivers I ever had on Lyft. Who cares what they car was. One was so comical, I felt like I had been kidnapped my Russian mafia. And not like in a funny way.",25,2023,5,2,1,

kbb66bd,186uzjn,FlashGordonRacer,"Damn. That's a good chart. It's a bit of a ""pick your denominator"" problem if your arguement is whether D.C.-wide or D.C.-area retail is struggling because you isolate to only the BID geographies. That said, it's probably the best public data available beyond something proprietary that CRE consultants can produce with private data. H Street Main Street and H Street Development Corp only have three staff each and I'm not sure they are FTE and they don't have BID-level revenue base.",9,2023,11,2,1,

kbb7ab2,186uzjn,FlashGordonRacer,The real way to do this is to make M Street transit/ped/bike/Fire/EMS only and upgrade the Whitehurst freeway into a modern traffic sewer. Few of the people in cars at Wisc and M want to stay in the neighborhood.,11,2023,11,2,1,
kbeepwk,186uzjn,No-Lunch4249,">There‚Äôs no oversight 

They‚Äôre non-profit orgs with a board of directors made up of the ratepayers/business owners, and they publish annual reports on their activities and how they used their money. They also have to go before the city council every 5 years to be renewed/reauthorized.

I wouldn‚Äôt say there‚Äôs NO oversight. The thing about business owners resolving disputes with the BID passes the smell test but I don‚Äôt own a business so I wouldn‚Äôt know much about that",8,2023,11,2,1,
kbg175k,186uzjn,FlashGordonRacer,You'll be interested to hear that D.C. Council is considering legislation to make tests like this possible beyond one-off street festival things. I've been involved with 18th St NW folks and AdMo BID to get their pedestrian zone going. It's been very difficult because the city's rules haven't fit the specific use case of a pedestrian/transit/fire/ems/police/bike-only thoroughfare.,5,2023,11,2,1,
kbftzoj,186uzjn,PlayfulPairDC,"I should have been more specific, the sidewalk extensions (the grey faux wood) area is generally empty.  In fact many of them have been slowly removed in the last few months.  The actual sidewalks are have plenty of foot traffic as they have for all the decades I have lived here.  I could also add that if people weren't able to work remotely and the Federal Government was requiring people to come to their offices, the gridlock would be terrible.  I just don't think rooting for the core of DC to rot out with fewer people coming in is a good long term form of traffic planning.  It isn't like bike lanes (mostly empty), or Metro (insolvent and suggesting draconian cuts of service) are very viable options to replace traffic on surface streets.",0,2023,11,2,1,
