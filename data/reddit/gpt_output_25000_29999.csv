kbfvp7z,186uzjn,PlayfulPairDC,"I live very near the Key Bridge, am I no longer going to be able to cross from Virginia to my home?  Will I have to wait for the gondola to be built?  The river crossing at that location also predates the Key Bridge, previous to its construction there was a surface over the canal crossing that allowed for horse and carriage vehicles to cross at that point to enter Georgetown.  Cutting off traffic flow from the Key Bridge would be tantamount to condemning Georgetown.  Traffic calming tends to blow up in the face of people doing it if they create gridlock, see Wisconsin Avenue in Glover Park.  A very expensive re street scaping done about 12 years ago that lasted only a few months before everyone clamored for it to be undone as it created massive congestion and hurt local businesses, not to mention funneling more traffic into residential areas.",1,2023,11,2,1,

kbg6hax,186uzjn,Ok_Culture_3621,I question the implied assumption that allowing for more car traffic is the solution for downtown. The core already concedes a great deal of space to car travel and storage. The amount that’s been taken away for bike lanes and streeteries is a very small slice of a very big pie. And there’s no evidence I’ve seen that taking away that small slice is what’s hollowed out downtown. Downtown’s problems are decades in the making and can’t be reversed by any one policy.,1,2023,11,2,1,

Obvi, WMATA has the BLOOP with G'Town Metro stop and second Rosslyn platform for getting across the river. In the next 5-10 years, the most realistic thing is to use tactical quick-build designs to get transit bus traffic more effectively across the Key Bridge and then do bus lanes on M and Wisc. I'm Team Streetcar all the way west to the waterfront, and another line up Wisc -- but that is also a 25-40 years from now solution like the BLOOP.",1,2023,11,2,1,

I grew up in a big city in the 90s and remember when homicides were a lot higher than now. It’s not something we should aspire to. And there are clear national trends around policing and enforcement of laws that dictate whether crime rates and murder rates go up and down.

And, no, it’s not dense to study the long term trends around homicides. The graph from 1900 onward is at least worth considering when we try to understand what’s normal or not around homicides. It’s useful to compare to other industrialized countries as well.

>The Connecticut Avenue Multimodal Safety Improvement Project (originally named Connecticut Avenue NW Reversible Lane Safety and Operations Study) was initiated in December 2019. Data analysis, concept development and evaluation, traffic forecasts, and operations analysis were conducted between Spring 2020 and Fall 2020. Between March 2020 and January 2023 approximately 70 stakeholder and agency presentations/events have taken place.

>**During 2021, four Advisory Neighborhood Commissions- ANC 3C, 3E, 3F and 3/4G -and numerous organizations provided resolutions to DDOT requesting that “Concept C” be advanced. On December 15, 2021, Mayor Bowser and DDOT requested the project staff to move forward with Concept C. Concept C includes the removal of the reversible lanes and the addition of one-way protected bicycle lanes on the east and west sides of Connecticut Avenue.** The project also adds other safety improvements, including the addition of left and right turn lanes at intersections, pedestrian refuge islands and curb extensions, intersection realignments, prohibition of Right Turn on Reds, reducing the posted speed limit from 30 mph to 25 mph, and other features.

>On March 19, 2020, the official start of the Covid-19 pandemic, the District Department of Transportation deactivated the operation of the Connecticut Avenue NW peak hour reversible lanes. A decision was subsequently made to permanently remove the peak hour reversible lanes. Removal of the reversible lanes’ signs and markings were completed in the summer 2022. In addition, one of the Concept C recommendations was to reduce the Connecticut Avenue speed limit from 30 mph to 25 mph. This action was also completed in summer 2022.

>**In early 2023, the DDOT leadership has requested that project staff take a fresh look at all of the concepts that were considered, including a reassessment of Concept C. DDOT has received a considerable number of comments during this past year related to the parking removals required to implement Concept C. This reassessment currently is occurring as of August 2023.**

>DDOT has recently reformulated our Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) for the project. This reformulation of the CAC has occurred because the boundaries of the Advisory Neighborhood Commissions and Single-member Districts have changed based on redistricting and the results of the latest decennial census. We expect that the first meeting of this reformulated CAC will occur in fall 2023.

I loved taking the metro 10 mins or less to Soundcheck for EDM shows, to Metro Center and a short walk to Capitol One arena for bigger concerts or sporting events, or to Warner Theatre and DC improv for comedy shows. Also very convenient for events at the Kennedy Center. Look up the other music venues in DC like The Anthem (at the wharf), 930 club, Atlantis, songbyrd, echostage, flash, capitol one arena, Lincoln theatre, union stage, merriweather post pavilion, etc. Will help you see what the commute would be like to each (the Moovit app is good for public transit estimations).  Songbyrd would be right in your neighborhood in Noma, and Noma has an outdoor free concert series in the summer. Need to take a couple legs to get to several of the venues from rosslyn (eg need to transfer on metro from O/B/S to green line north to get to U st venues of 930 and Atlantis, or to green line south to get to wharf venues of Anthem and Union stage). But honestly when shows get out after 1 AM you’re likely going to have to uber/lyft home to noma or to rosslyn either way for most of these venues since our metro system doesn’t run too late here. I find Ubers/lyfts home to rosslyn decently affordable since by mileage it’s not far from DC proper. If there’s surge pricing, I just e-bike home instead — it’s honestly my fave mode of getting around DC since we have such robust bike lanes.

There’s a small social scene in Rosslyn if you’re looking to grab a beer right after work - there’s a neighborhood bar called Quinn’s that’s always busy.  Open road is also always busy during HH as is continental beer garden in warm months. Salt cocktail bar for something fancier.

You can walk to  Clarendon for more restaurant and bar options, but lots of basic early 20 years old there, I always personally prefer the venture into DC proper for the actual DC cultural experience. So yes, you’ll have more options in noma. 

Re social clubs and sports, will prob have better access in Noma. I have friends on intramural teams that are based in noma, and my bf’s soccer teams are often in the district in navy yard or Shaw. 

Also re social life, I commented on someone else’s post that almost all my friends are in DC because I made an effort to spend time in DC, not Arlington. I have a single friend in Arlington and countless friends in DC. Its certainly helpful when my DC friends live or enjoy hanging out in neighborhoods most convenient for me to get to from rosslyn, such as DuPont circle, Georgetown, west end, foggy bottom, Chinatown, Logan circle. When I’ve had friends up in Columbia heights, petworth, Adams Morgan, or Mount Pleasant it’s more of a PITA by public transit to get to them. Some friends are more willing than others to pick a meeting spot that’s a good middle ground for both parties. And as the other poster said, some people are a bit immature about crossing over the river despite rosslyn being one metro stop (three mins) from the district. Now if they don’t want to take multiple legs of transit to get to someone that’s one thing, but if they live in Capitol Hill and would be open to taking O/B/S lines to foggy bottom, but not rosslyn, that’s just asinine imo. I had a rooftop pool I invited my friends to in the summer, and one of them literally gave me that as her rationale for passing - just tell me you don’t wanna come… But yeah, if you’re trying to date, I could potentially see it being an automatic swipe left when ppl see you’re in Arlington because of those mindsets, so to keep your options open, noma could be better in that sense (although I personally wouldn’t want to date someone so closed-minded lol)

Not sure how much crime matters to you, but noma’s is worse than rosslyn’s for sure. Nothing particularly wrong with that if you have a good head on your shoulders and have tolerance for some grunginess and sketchiness - chance of being assaulted is higher but many prefer neighborhoods with character and more crime over a bland area like rosslyn. The vibes in the two neighborhoods couldn’t be more different - night and day.
 
For me, I fly a lot - so I love that rosslyn gets me metro access to both DCA and IAD easily without transfers.  I value commute to work, airport access, safety, and love walking home from the metro late at night alone. So I accept that rosslyn itself doesn’t have a vibrant social life for me, and that there is an additional hassle of having to take the metro or bike to have access to DC vibes that I love, rather than being able to walk to them (cannot afford to live in DC / I don’t like the neighborhoods that I can afford).

Feel free to dm me if you have any questions and good luck with the move!",9,2024,11,2,1,

As for the bus, I think buses are great! I've never had any major issues and any time someone has gotten out of hand (such as shouting or swearing a lot) the bus driver told the person to knock it off or they would kick them off. 

Or consider getting a bike or Capital Bikeshare membership - I use bikeshare to get from the metro to work (about 1 mile) and it is great!

Three thoughts:

1. Do not get into a set routine - leaving and/or coming home at the same time every day and taking the same exact route every day is a mistake anywhere. I feel very safe where I live (and my fiance is a 6' tall big guy with a beard) but I still make a point to vary my routine one day every week or two - leave 15 minutes earlier, come home slightly later, stop at the grocery store randomly, etc.

2. Consider carrying pepper spray or some other similar option. I used to in college, don't feel the need to anymore. I never needed it but it made me feel safer at the time. It also gave me more confidence and a better ""don't fuck with me"" attitude. Which leads me to ... 

3. If you walk around like you know where you are going and do not want anyone to mess with you most people will leave you alone. If you are staring at your phone (or otherwise distracted), looking around like you are lost, or are just generally unsure then it draws more attention.

§ 22–2302. Prohibited acts.

(a) No person may ask, beg, or solicit alms, including money and other things of value, in an aggressive manner in any place open to the general public, including sidewalks, streets, alleys, driveways, parking lots, parks, plazas, buildings, doorways and entrances to buildings, and gasoline service stations, and the grounds enclosing buildings.

In the case of the women on the metro, if the harassment was extended and you feel comfortable, I would just casually place your body between the harasser and them. You don't need to make eye contact with the harasser or engage in anyway.

First, if you have money to spare, help someone in need out. If not, you always have grace to spare. Take ten seconds to look a fellow human being in the eye, tell them you can’t help them right now, and wish them well.  

Second, if you have the time and skill to help someone who is clearly in trouble, do so. If the woman looked shaken up from being called a bitch, it’s ok to ask if she’s ok.

Third, have some empathy for people who are clearly having a tough day/week/month/year. You don’t have to excuse someone’s behavior in order to understand it.

I think the spirit of this post is essentially asking how do you act as a good bystander in these situations especially when it's a male shouting at a female. I don't think this is a simple question to answer because we are constantly told to ""see something say something"" but then also ""mind your business"" in cities. This feels like a clear contradiction to me. I obviously would say asking for advice is a reasonable thing to do because not everyone grows up in a city and there is no manual on how one should act in a city before moving here.

But in the 80's - 90's you saw the shift because of smaller police forces and the idea that technology (radios, surveillance, ect) and the expansion of investigation offices (narcotics, gangs, firearms) police forces felt that these specialized investigation units could do better crime prevention and enforcement. Also, a reason for the move away from this was the rampant corruption of those foot patrol officers who either was paid off to elected to turn a blind eye to a lot of the organized crime in their areas.  

Interestingly enough, our operations in Iraq up to 2007-2008 surge was very much like our police, we'd drive around in our humvees looking for or in many cases waiting for insurgents to engage us while conducting soft/hard knock searches at night. During the surge we conducted more foot patrols, integrated into our local areas in small COPs with local Iraqi police or Iraqi army units and created a much bigger and sustained presence versus daily patrols from our FOB. This marked at first large incidents of fighting because we were not embedded in our AOs but dropped shortly as we denied the insurgents freedom of movement and ability to operate within the local population. 

Bottom-line: It would help to have more offices foot patrolling but it'll require hiring more officers, provide more training, and a long-term investment in those officers becoming more integrated in the neighborhoods.",123,2024,1,2,1,

kjewb6w,19el7l2,thebarkingdog,"MPD here.

First answer: We don't have the officers. 

We're so short most Districts are holding over officers from the previous shift nearly every day to make minimum staffing. We weren't defunded, but the freeze in hiring by the council in 2020 will be felt for another decade. And we HAVE to staff the patrol cars first, and we can barely do that. 

Ex. 5 years ago, Adams Morgan and U Street had two units, 40 officers, 20 for each location in addition to regular patrol. That unit is now down to 15 officers for both locations.

Second Answer: Resource allocation. 

Contee made the news when he consolidated and made the all bike patrol unit a few years ago. Except it wasn't made up of new officers but instead, officers he pulled from the Districts. So those Districts lost their officers to other parts of the city.

Third: Practicality. 

Putting someone on a foot beat for 40 hours a week, wears on them. Now factor in weather, call volume, duties, training, etc. And you can see where it can go wrong. Also, for all the criticism of cops simply sitting in their cars, cars provide a safe place to sit, place to store food, gear, paperwork, a computer, and when an emergency comes out, nearby or across the District, officers need cars to get there faster than feet can.",32,2024,1,2,1,

As your USA Today piece points out, white police officers tend to live in the cities where they worked when those cities were majority-white and white officers were also more likely to reside outside the city than their Black or Latino counterparts.

The piece also includes the argument that residency requirements should be more specific in order to be effective and require officers to live in the neighborhoods where they work.

Someone was just robbed at gunpoint on the front stoop of my apartment building LAST NIGHT. A terrifying experience, no doubt. However, I give you my cost benefit analysis of why it's still worth it to live in the hood.

Let's say you get mugged, and give them what they want, immediately (which, for the record, you should ALWAYS DO, without question). You'll end up losing your cash, nothing on credit if you call your company soon enough, and probably the fees to get a new license/ID, maybe your Smartrip, etc. Maybe you also lose your nice purse or wallet, but we'll say all of that is worth around $250. The biggest ""cost"" you'll face is the fear of being mugged. Say that is $1000 worth of fear to you (weird concept, but humor me here - this is how cost benefit analysis works). If you move to Near NE, KNOWING that you will get mugged, it becomes something that you're prepared for, and slightly less scared of. The cost of doing business, so to speak. You know it's going to happen, you're not going to get hurt if you hurry up and give the money and don't argue, and you have come to terms with that. And then it becomes a little less scary, and maybe you're only facing $500 of fear. That is now only $750 you're going to lose by being mugged. If it happens once a year (WAY more often than real life), that is a lot less than you're saving on rent by living in the hood. Of course, realizing all this and internalizing it makes the idea even less scary (although guns are still REALLY scary in person) so it's an even better deal.

I've lived around H st for 2 years and never had a problem. I've seen problems, and heard of them, and had them happen to my friends, but it hasn't happened to me yet. I'm prepared for it though, by assuming it WILL eventually happen. If the area gentrifies even more (which it appears to be doing), bonus! In fact, chances are you may never be mugged.

cc9g072,1mhwjr,maker86,"I'm going to assume he has a few issues here.  First, the guy probably isn't using an assault rifle as most people define it.  The distinction has to do with whether the rifle can fire more than one bullet with a pull of the trigger.  It's unlikely that an automatic weapon would be used in a crime as they're fairly expensive and hard to come by.  If this is just a standard AR-15 type weapon, and that's what it sounds like, it would be more appropriately defined as an assault weapon (as opposed to assault rifle), though that term is often also met with hostility as it classes a weapon based more on appearance than functionality.

The other possible issue is that if this were instead an automatic rifle, say an M4 or M16, that fact wouldn't really matter much.  Automatic fire is seldom useful for anything but suppression, which means keeping the enemy under cover while friendlies reposition or evacuate.  It's true that automatic gun fire can kill many people quickly if they're all grouped together and not expecting it, but this situation has evolved past that now.

More useful information would be a whether its a standard rifle or a carbine, the caliber of the rifle, what kind of optics he has, does it look like he's carrying a lot of extra magazines, does he have any sidearms or specialty weapons like a shotgun for breeching, any kind of grenades, what other gear is he wearing, and does he have any kind of communication equipment.  I'm not saying that knowing if the rifle is capable of full auto is not useful information, but it is not as useful as the other information I've noted.  Additionally, the media has proven themselves unreliable in determining weapon types, so there's absolutely no reason to take them seriously in this regard.",5,2013,9,2,1,
cc9fyiq,1mhwjr,,"The ""assault"" designator can be useful assuming we know enough about the rifle. It has a specific definition relating to the caliber and action type.

hhhw1q6,qcrzz5,flugzugunddasauto,"I grew up in upper northwest (not Georgetown) and my parents still live in the house I grew up in. They bought it in the mid-80s with less than 3% down and the thing has gone up in value over 12x since they bought it and they’ve done relatively minimal improvements since the mid 90s. 

Until the last 5 years, many of their neighbors were 9-5 public sector employees or worked at NGOs or other non-profits. Most but not all were college educated with bachelors degrees but were not lobbyists or “Big Law” lawyers or anything. The woman who lived next door worked at the DC public library and her husband was an HVAC technician before he retired. 

Recently, many longtime residents have retired and sold their houses to the folks many other commenters will assume already owned these houses. Some have been forced to sell because they couldn’t afford the real estate taxes on their dramatically appreciated houses.

While the new buyers today quite wealthy in many west-of-park neighborhoods, this was not always the case. The city was very different back when my parents bought their place in a whole host of ways. The dramatic appreciation in real estate values since the mid-90s, and the post-08 change in the mortgage process, has completely changed the profile of people who can buy here. 

Those younger buyers replacing my childhood neighbors are of course in the stereotypical industries. Those are the only people who can afford to buy those houses at market these days. Many of these folks are transient DC residents and not native Washingtonians who bought way before the housing market became what it is today. There’s no issue with new people moving here, it’s just that those folks are the only ones who can buy at market. 

Tl;dr: lots of the transient folks in those areas are wealthy, many of the long time residents bought in a different era when it was much easier to buy a place to live here. The number LTRs declines every year because by definition they are all old and aging.",70,2021,10,2,1,

Also, saving a lot doesn't equate to having a high investment portfolio.  Having $20k in the bank, is different than owning a $100,000 home with a $20k down payment.

Your  landlord isn't paying for those things out of the goodness of their hearts. It's baked into the cost of your rent. Sure you lose out on closing costs. But still, tell me in what world someone is able to pay for housing and save the  equivalent value of the equity they gain on their home each month.

Yes there are upfront and backend costs to sale. Yes there is tax and insurance and interest costs. But all these exist in commercial real estate as well and are passed on to the renter. 

Also to describe a mortgage as not owning the house until the end of the mortgage is totally inaccurate. If that were the case you wouldn't see a dime selling the house before the mortgage was up. You own the value of the house minus the amount owed to the mortgage lender. 

The premise of your point is still faulty. There is no where I've lived where renting an equivalent property cost less than a mortgage including property tax, interest and insurance.

The problem is not that you still pay for housing when you purchase your home because those costs are explicitly laid out when you buy the house. The problem is indeed that if you invest your down-payment and don't buy a house, you still have to pay the equivalent of a mortgage and all related costs to house yourself. There isn't magic extra money to invest.

You act like you've got all these gotchas that no one has considered, but literally everyone understands the costs. And literally every one is passed on to the renter. You can tell by the cost of rent being higher or equivalent to a mortgage and all associated costs.",2,2021,10,2,1,

I full ass wouldn’t do this, but also I’m a woman and have seen a *lot* of this style post and it’s usually a scam or some dude being like “FREE RENT! looking for a female roommate 18-25 willing to share a studio. Must be in shape, clean the apartment, cook me three meals, and share my bed” style bullshit. 

If we are going to look past that, here are a few thoughts:

Have you ever shared a studio before? I know you said you’re fine with it, but until you’ve done it you might not be thinking about some of the practical challenges it entails. I shared a studio with my now husband when I first moved here and we were waiting for his lease to run out. Sharing a space with no walls can be awkward even if you are in a relationship with the person. I can’t imagine sharing one with someone I didn’t know.

Think about things like sleep habits, different levels of cleanliness, etc. When you have a roommate but each have your own bedroom it creates the idea of private vs. shared space. The general consensus among every roommate I’ve ever had is that your bedroom can be as messy as you want but the common space is to be kept clean as a courtesy to your roommates. A studio, even a large one, could create an environment where one of you wants to be awake when the other wants to be asleep, or where one person keeps things very tidy and the other person lets their “bedroom” area king of take over.

This isn’t to say dude is a bad guy—although of course you are correct to be wary of assault, sexual violence, theft, etc when moving in with anyone—but someone’s annoying habits become a lot more annoying when you can’t get away from them. Additionally, it will likely always feel like his space and not your home. What happens if one of you meets and brings them home or someone wants to entertain? 

If you do go for it, I’d definitely take the small dressing room area and put a single bed in there, lock the door and be done with it. That said, it could produce its own challenges, if you’re in the dressing room that means he now needs to get dressed and ready entirely in the bathroom, or else he’s just naked in the common space, which is awkward.

Did you get a chance to talk to him about his lifestyle at all? What hours he’s home, what time he needs to get ready for work, when/if he entertains at home, and the like?",3,2023,10,2,1,

One day he said he was moving back to the states and that my roommate and I had, 15 days to vacate. And he could do that because there was no protection for us since we were subletting illegally. I ended up finding an apartment but couldn’t move in until the end of the month which meant moving all my shit to a storage unit and couch surfing for a few weeks then moving into the new place, which was very annoying.

If you don’t have a lot of stuff (e.g. you won’t have to get a storage unit) and the dude didn’t seem creepy it could work, but it is RISKY in terms of personal safety and housing security. It will never feel like your place, he could expect something of you, and you could be out on your ass if it doesn’t work out.

Also I think myself and plenty of others in this sub are COMPLETELY mystified by being able to find something for $400/month in DC.

As someone else responded, if the killing happened in the same unit where the repeated fighting happens, this problem may go away on its own, as one person involved may be deceased and the other on their way to jail.

NoMa gets a bad rep because of its past. Before the Harris Teeter, before the dog run, before the Metro was built there, before Tony Williams was mayor, the neighborhood wasn't great. In fact, it was quite shitty. But since those things above have happened the neighborhood have improved quite a bit. For one there are the apartments you're talking about moving into. On the east side of 2nd street there's a neighborhood full of long-term residents who've witnessed the bad and the good and they're happy that things are improving. There's a police sub-station on 2nd between M and Florida, too, with plenty of squad cars driving around throughout the day and night. Don't get me wrong, like any neighborhood east of the park, plenty of crimes are committed in the area. I wouldn't say it's any more or less than anywhere else though people might disagree (""But tummlr, NoMa is near North Capital Street!"" ""Tummlr you fool, NoMa is adjacent to the projects"" ""There are clubs in the area!"" etc.) It's crime, it's random, it happens everywhere, and you can protect yourself by being vigilant and using common sense. Even still, shit happens. Will you have to stay in your apartment when the sun goes down? No, there are no vampires in Northeast.

Economic disparities within countries, along with periods of economic downturn, drive up crime and homicides, and violent crimes occurs four times more often in countries with wide income gaps. While economic prosperity tends to decrease violent crime, crime itself can depress community development, perpetuating a cycle of poverty and violence.

I recently experienced a race-based incident (I'm physically fine) and MPD responded very quickly, found the person a few hours later, and detained them with a hate crime enhancement. If your assailant made it clear that it was race-based, you can PM me if you want to talk about it or have questions about next steps as I am comfortable sharing my (anecdotal!) experience. 

The prosecutor (Asst AG for race-based incidents!) explained that because of the enhancement, the assailant will be psychologically evaluated and can receive affordable, timely anger management / mental health counseling. She also said that they will be detained until the detention hearing as a public safety concern if you are worried about your assailant threatening people in the area. If there is no outstanding criminal record, you can even ask for diversion, which means the charge will not go on their permanent record and they will instead do stuff like community service. It is unfortunately no longer an option in my situation, but I wanted to share a bit in case you were conflicted about trying again with a police report or wondering about the hate crime enhancement.",36,2022,1,2,1,

I'd recommend you reach out to your cell phone service provider and file a complaint.

jwd4fon,15repdb,PreposterisG,"I am going to assume what people really worry about is the chance themselves (or friends or other closely related people) are victimized. A vast majority of DC crime is poor young black men on other poor people. So if you are not a poor person that knows poor young black men, I don't think the risk is as clear as it seems. I don't think there is good data on crime perpetrated by strangers against non-poor people (which I assume the average user of this subreddit to be). 

I am not trying to minimize and say any life is worth more than another. The murder rate is morally abhorrent. But I think what people are really worried about is the risk to themselves, and these overall murder rates are likely not a good indicator of that for a lot of people.  

For me the easy risk comparison is driving on a highway. My gut says that the risk you trade off of not getting randomly murdered in DC is probably around the risk you take on of dying in a car accident if you move to the burbs.

I'm also not new to this city. I've lived here for 10+ years. I used to rent a garage in an alley in Trinidad and saw some real sketchy shit. I worked for an electric scooter/moped company that sent me to parts of the city that likely very few people on reddit have ever experienced. In all that time, never experienced anything more than package theft and rarely felt unsafe. I'm male if that matters.

However, 3 weeks ago 2 men robbed me at gunpoint 2 blocks from my home, on a street where most of the homes are $1 million+ (no bragging here, I rent). This was at 3pm on a Sunday afternoon, literally in front of people pushing strollers. A week later, my wife was chased down the street by a man who physically tried to grab her. Same neighborhood; same 7 figure homes. Reiterating that I understand statistical probability, and that I'm unlikely to ever experience that again, the random nature of what happened to me is impossible to defend against.

Which is a crazy shitty calculus to have to make as a prosecutor. Not saying I like this prosecutor. I just am skeptical that a new one could magically do a lot better with the same tool-set.

And I'm not sure Biden has the ability to put the needed resources in the hands of any prosecutor that he might appoint.

Again, you're incoherent, but if you're trying to say that the drop in DC's prosecution rates was in line with national trends, then you're once again completely wrong. USAO's prosecution rates are abysmal in a comparative sense. [NYC on average declines to prosecute 11% of felonies and 17% of misdemeanors. USAO on the other hand declines to prosecute 53% of felonies and 72% of misdemeanors.](https://twitter.com/dccrimefacts/status/1692533088088207638) It's completely out of line with national trends.

Search for DC Crime Cards and look at the map (for some reason the map doesn't work on Chrome, so you'll have to use Edge or Safari). Filter the map to show all violent crime with or without a gun in the last 2 years. It'll give you insight on the neighborhoods that are safest. As you'll see, there's some hot spots (dark purple) in NW, NE, and SE. Places that are yellow or blue will generally be ideal.

Generally speaking from hanging out there, and this could just be a pre versus post covid thing, you know where not to go in Chicago. Around here, I can be coming out of Comet and someone can hop out of a car and just start beating the shit out of someone at the bus stop. Tanner park had a damn drive by. I was in a liquor store- a pretty nice one in northwest- and 3 girls came in and ran away with a whole end cap. Walked into lost gen one time and a dude had been mugged on a run at 3:30 pm (that was the guy who mugged 18 or so people in a stretch of a week). That’s not happening on the lake trail in broad daylight out there, IIRC. There were a series of assaults and a murder at Catholic, I don’t think that’s happening at DePaul (though maybe it is, I dunno). Kids throwing rocks at people on a trail is just normalized here. Maybe it doesn’t percolate up into the news in other cities, but one city I lived in which people think of as much worse than DC one bad kid trying to fight a lady on a trail was in the news for a week, and here it’s just Tuesday. 

I haven’t lived anywhere where a universal piece of advice is “avoid transit when school gets out.”

These are all parts of town where, you know, generally they’re pretty nice- some were not nice not too long ago- but you will either witness some shit, or get there shortly after some shit has happened, and that’s just not very common in other cities in the US and we shouldn’t pretend it is. 

Maybe it’s just post COVID there’s a mean shift down everywhere, and bullshit is more likely to pop off everywhere, I dunno, I suspect that’s true. But people in DC normalize insane things as “city living” and as someone who has lived in medium to large US cities their entire adult life- and in some neighborhoods that still haven’t transitioned- that stuff just isn’t normal.

I still think crime is acceptably pretty rare. And I’m not going to be targeted or have family targeted, so I’m not too too worried. But it’s crazy to me how it pops up everywhere.

Every one of the Downtown Zones has a housing requirement except D-7, which covers a couple blocks between the White House and 9th st. So if that’s the area you’re talking about then I guess you’re right but all the other D-XX zones have a housing requirement.

Because property managers typically don’t want to manage more than one kind of tenant, they’ll usually do “swaps” of the required residential and commercial space between properties in the same zone, so while the building itself might not be mixed, the area is. This is something that has to be OKd by the zoning commission (or maybe the zoning administrator? Don’t remember)

That said I do agree there’s not NEARLY enough housing downtown, and the housing ratio requirement for D zones and MU zones should be a lot higher IMO.

kx0rm0r,1bpvvu3,The-20k-Step-Bastard,"It’s adjacency. Urban designers (especially Jane Jacobs who first documented this) assert that neighborhood vibrancy comes from mixed use at all times of day. 

If Chinatown ONLY exists for sports, and only like 100 nights a year, then the remaining 2/3rds of the time is just opportunity for it to spiral. 

You’ve got 395/395 tunnels and giant faceless government buildings to the east, the lawns to the south, and the White House to the west. The only truly healthy thing around it is Mt. Vernon/Logan circle to the north, and people aren’t often walking/biking from their homes in Logan circle to the NGA every day of the week. And L’Enfant station area is the worst example of well-planned urban design, it’s a dour and desolate area of just loading docks in the side of massive office buildings. And right after that? Another highway. And THEN the Wharf. And then the water. 

If Chinatown had the Logan Circle / Mt. Vernon stuff on all four sides of it it would be the best place in the city. But shitty urban design and urban highways constricts it. 

One way to fix this would be to build massive amounts of dense housing in both Chinatown and in the rest of the city. Neighborhood competition doesn’t really happen the way you describe. It’s like the Chum Bucket and the Crusty Crab, or Bob’s Burgers versus Jimmy Pesto. In real life, relationships between businesses and neighborhoods aren’t like that. An adjacent neighborhood improving will directly improve Chinatown, because now there are more people with adjacency who will walk or bike through Chinatown in their daily lives - instead of people in Bethesda taking the red line down to watch a basketball game. 

You want organic, mixed use street life that includes early morning joggers, then construction workers going to their pre-dawn starts, then white collar people going to work, then the people at home taking their toddlers to the parks, then the office people getting lunch, then the students walking home from school, then the office people walking home after work, then the couples getting dinner, then the youngsters meeting for dates, then the party guys hitting the bars, then the high school k’noodlers kissing in the park, then the next day it starts all over again. This requires density in adjacency, better walking/biking access, better safety (more patrols, more lighting), parks, mixed use developments, easily crossable streets, and more.

IMO, You also need a neighborhood to be able to stand on its own as a mixed use place, and not just be a hanger-on. So yeah you can do all those BIG changes to the city’s infrastructure, and they’d be worthy and worthwhile changes, but I do genuinely believe you need to change a lot of the building uses IN downtown and Chinatown as well. But clearly the market isn’t there yet, so you need to use carrots (housing in downtown tax abatement) or sticks (stop approving tax assessment write downs for office vacancy?) to get private owners to make that change.

l31bogx,1cmfulr,Suddenlyforever,"This always puzzled me when people say that, because DC has historically low property taxes. Like a house worth 875k equals taxes of $473 a month, and a house worth 469k equals taxes of $227 a month (all based of Zillow estimates). Even if you made minimum wage ($17/hr), after taxes you would take home $2,265 (used an online tax calculator). So even if your property doubled in value, your increase in home cost would be still 20% of net income which I think is pretty good! 

I agree if you rent it’s a larger issue, as there’s no stopping those luxury condos from charging crazy prices, but whenever people argue about property taxes in DC it never made sense to me as our taxes have always been so historically low!",7,2024,5,2,1,
l30hsrt,1cmfulr,epitome23,"The threat of “property taxes” is a canard that is often used to attack new development, but ignores how DC actually taxes its citizens. 

Property taxes only significantly increase when homeowners make significant improvements in their properties and their value is reassessed. The neighbor who hasn’t done anything with their home in 30 years may see a marginal increase in taxes if the neighborhood dramatically improves, but nothing close to the increase that a flipped house sees. 

DC is also very generous regarding property taxes to senior citizens and those facing hardship. And they limit how quickly taxes can be raised annually. 

So for the long-time property owner in a gentrifying neighborhood who still has a mortgage, who is not yet a senior citizen, who is not facing hardship, and has maintained their property will see an increase in property tax but has also seen an even more significant increase in their property’s value and available equity.",15,2024,5,2,1,

DC has a bail system in which the City does not require people post cash bail. There is [research](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/incomejails.html) that points out that cash bail has a particularly hard hitting effect on racial minorities. Judge Morrison of DC Superior Court is a champion of this cause. He said in an interview with NPR that, [""[In 2017], we released 94 percent of all the people that we arrested without using money. Eighty-eight percent made every single court appearance, and 86 percent were never arrested for any criminal offense of any kind. And of the very small percent of people that were arrested in D.C. that we released, less than 2 percent were rearrested for a crime of violence.""](https://www.npr.org/2018/09/02/644085158/what-changed-after-d-c-ended-cash-bail) The thing I think that is interesting about his quote is that he says that ""less than 2 percent were rearrested for a crime of *violence.*"" In 2016 the Washington Post examined this and came up with the figure that [out of 100 released, 11 are rearrested, and 2 are rearrested for violent crimes,](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/when-it-comes-to-pretrial-release-few-other-jurisdictions-do-it-dcs-way/2016/07/04/8eb52134-e7d3-11e5-b0fd-073d5930a7b7_story.html) which is consistent with his claim, but more complete. That represents a 11% ~~recidivism~~ offense rate overall for those released. The data also may not paint full picture because just because someone commits a crime does not mean that they are going to get caught. It is worth noting that the same article notes that the Metro stabbing that occurred a few years ago involved a perpetrator who was released on bail 2 days prior on a misdemeanor charge. 

DC uses a computer system to calculate whether a person should be re-released or held with regard to bail. It looks at 70 factors and apparently, all things considered, operates on a presumption of release. I'd be interested in seeing what those factors are and if they are enough. It would also be interesting to see how many people are held pretrial in other jurisdictions versus DC's numbers.

Nah, we just ignore people who were hurt/killed by idealism and emotional ""rationalizing,"" facts and logic be damned, and obviously the rights of a couple of violent criminals who might actually go on to not be violent again during the early release period is more important than the rights of the public who gets to deal with the violence of those who aren't going to live without being violent.  You want to stem violent crime?  Maybe get real with violent people.  Stop DAs from all these pleas to lesser charges, stop with probation before judgement on its face as the status quo, make this an offer ONLY after the violent criminal has proven they are very likely to not re-offend.  

But sure, it's the cops who are releasing violent criminals back into the public early, sure.  You've quite succinctly illustrated that you have no idea what is going on in the world of policing violent crime/criminals.",-11,2019,8,2,1,

You need to be willing to shoot, in an instant's notice, possibly with little information (e.g. not knowing if the other person is armed, not knowing if they're a minor). You need to be willing to shoot to kill. You need to be able to not hesitate. And that's all assuming you're willing to carry a loaded gun, and that you have no other safety risks (like a small child) that make an unlocked gun a huge safety issue. And even then, a gun doesn't work for every situation-- if your gun is in a holster and someone already has a knife out, you simply don't have time to shoot them. It needs to be the exact right situation for you to 'win', it's not a guaranteed answer to prevent being stabbed.

If someone doesn't fit all the above, a gun makes things worse. If you hesitate, you may have just given the bad guy the gun-- especially if you're a small person and it's easy to take off you.

There is a general negative attitude that the area east of the river as well as the people and this can raise its ugly head even in subtle ways and that needs to end.  

When people talk about Northwest they generally will be specific about which neighborhood they are referring to but sadly many people even those that have called DC home for decades are completely oblivious to the reality of anything on the other side of the Anacostia River.

- How every neighborhood has a similar, but different vibe. Idk how to explain it but I mainly hang out at the wharf (near where I work), Capitol Hill, Dupont Circle and Shaw neighborhoods and I love them for different reasons.
- There are so many different cuisines to try! 

- The desire to support local businesses is strong.

- Communities are also really strong (i.e. the art community)

- The ability to participate in important, arguably historic protests or other types of moments is available to me at a leisure. For example, I’m able to pop over to the Supreme Court for a protest after work. This is something I really try not to take for granted.

- Cultural events! I am so, so grateful to be able to enjoy events by embassies, the Kennedy Center,  the Museums, etc. — and any other smaller events that bring communities together. 

- The recreation in this city is fantastic. Between what you can do on the Potomac to exploring Rock Creek Park or the arboretum to just hanging out on the National Mall on a nice summer day is perfection. 

- The sports scene is great. I am a huge Capitals fan and the sports community is so welcoming. It’s not hard to bond over favorite teams.

j67beg4,10n3bb6,thekingoftherodeo,"Four things stand out as things I genuinely love about this area:

(1) DC has an incredible high end dining scene for its size. I'm relatively certain it has the most Michelin stars per capita in the US (if we generously associate the likes of the French Laundry with SF). The starred restaurants are also very varied in their speciality and price point, you can probably get out of Rooster & Owl with a tasting menu & a bottle of wine for ~$130pp all in while you could do Minibar and easily blow $500+ per person.

Even outside of the star circuit, you've got places like Marcel's which are superb.

(2) There are 3 relatively easily accessible airports with almost every major city covered with a direct flight. The competition also keeps a lid on prices, you'll find a flight you can afford even if you have to trek out to BWI (my least favorite of the 3 needless to say!), we aren't hub captive like folks in Charlotte would be to AA for example. 

For bonus points: you absolutely cannot beat a river visual approach into DCA sitting on the DC side on the plane, or indeed taking off to the north. A free sightseeing flight on every departure. Side note that for avgeeks here, Gravelly Point & Udvar-Hazy are fantastic to have accessible.

(3) The weather. Sure it gets hot in July/August, but we have relatively mild weather, mostly no significant disruptive events to worry about (one off derechos aside!) and a tangible 4 seasons, even if we're struggling for some powder this year.

(4) The ability to travel 3ish hours from here and get a completely different experience. NYC. Delaware/MD beaches. Shenandoah. VA vineyards. Snowshoe. Most places are lucky to have one of those things accessible.",43,2023,1,2,1,

As a southern person who lived in suburban or rural areas most of my life, I find NYC to be a bit too chaotic and impersonal to be appealing. I always wanted to live in a big, but not too big city, and D.C. is the happy middle ground.

There are four seasons but none are too extreme. It's super walkable with robust public transportation networks. You don't need a car, but a car can be helpful. Plus we have three airports and Amtrak to connect you to other cities on the East coast, which makes it a great launchpad for getting elsewhere in the country or around the world.

Much of the shopping, food, culture, sports, arts, activity, and nightlife that can be found in large cities can be found here to some extent. D.C. is expensive but, due to it's regional nature, there is more ""value"" to be found here in terms of trade offs that must be made for the sake of lifestyle vs cost of living.

Personality wise, D.C. is slightly less superficial than places like NYC, LA, and Miami.

jzohdyh,10n3bb6,Euphoric_AlgaeGum,"Ok this is going to be a long one!  First let me speak on the crime:

YES there is crime.  These days certainly your demographic does not matter.  This is very interesting because there was a time when non-marginalized (YT) residents in DC felt they were above it all.  They could be living in a high-end neighborhoods walking there dog happily 2 blocks over from a marginalized (POC) neighborhood at 2:00 am and not worry if there was a shoot-out ensuing.  The knowing (privilege) that you would remain unharmed and protected by law enforcement because of the color the (YT) color of your  skin put these residents in box of safety.  Where crime response by law-enforcement remained biased, violent and unproductive in marginalized neighborhoods.

Today...it DONT MATTER who you are!  The color of your skin DONT MATTER!  You are not above what's going on now!   Most of the crimes are being perpetuated by youth ages 11-17.   Girls...especially are joining these crimes spree's alot more too.  And surprisely the local media are being un-biased finally in whose performing crimes in the city.  Alot of the adult robberies and murders in the DMV area are showing YT faces!  Robberies in stores, domestic violence murders, a drunken fight turned bad.  Finally, the truth, this is not new!  It's just now televised.

A large percentage of these children have been found also to be ""honor roll"" students or ""perfect attendance"" students performing crimes in their school uniforms just seeking a thrill.  Our city has been left scratching their head.  Not all of   
 these children are of marginalized backgrounds.  There is an uprise of fights and violence in the schools.  DC no longer carries the Mayor Barry Summer Youth program and the after-school working programs that was once a component to keep children off these streets and emploring values by means of employment.

This is not the old 90's crime... THIS is the new 2020's crime!

Now, other than that...  
DC is a VIBRANT CITY to live and play in.  Although the cost-of living is high as hell, but the opportunities here matches the lifestyle to afford it.  There is much gentrification taking place here but not without also adding some development value to some once marginalized areas and offering programs of living to these newly re-developed areas.  HOWEVER, it's affecting ELDERLY residents very badly with no resources to re-locate or afford what options they are being giving.  

DC has the sports, kick-ass music venues, museums, the shops, fun-bars, politics, casinos across the ways, clubs, parks, great family fun and just a wonderful diverse culture!  Marijuana can now be consumed publicly too-lol.  There is SO MUCH here.  

 We are the creators, heartbeat and home of GO-GO music! But that's another tread! lol.  New incoming residents tried to silence GO-GO music being played at city events and street corners...but that went badly!  DC Native's here that grew up on the music or are a part of the new and old bands will not be muted so they held a rally!  Another DC win!

Would i recommend moving here or visiting here from wherever you are coming from?...ABSOLUTELY!  The best knowledge is from the experience itself!

PG County has among the most (if not the most) wealthy majority black neighborhoods in the country. I am not black, but I know several black professionals with young families that relocated to this area for exactly the reasons you state. Check out [this article about the area](https://www.bizjournals.com/washington/news/2017/08/18/the-heart-of-black-affluence-in-prince-georges.html). 

Unfortunately lots of it, especially the wealthiest/nicest neighborhoods, are not very Metro-accessible or walkable. Neighborhoods on the Orange or Blue Lines would have the most Metro-accessible routes to Arlington for work. Along the Orange Line, Cheverly and New Carollton are nice areas, Cheverly in particular is very popular with young families wanting to live close to DC. It is unfortunately not walkable to much aside from the Metro station and the local parks. Maybe someone else can chime in with ideas on the Blue Line. 

Other communities in PG County on the Route 1 Corridor (Mount Rainier, Hyattsville, College Park/University Park) are diverse, welcoming and more walkable to businesses and restaurants. Many of them are walkable to the Green Line or MARC but that would be a complicated and long commute to Arlington.

This new neighborhood seems like 4/10 White, 4/10 Black, 2/10 other.  As an Asian-American, I'm pretty happy with this.  That neighborhood I used to live in actually was like 9/10 White in the 80s-90s but that gradually those White people moved into rural areas because of scary minorities (I know this personally because one of my best childhood friends moved down to the Eastern Shore.  His parents were cool but unfortunately they were pretty racist, even if they were always kind to me, a shy Asian kid).  

Welcome to NOVA I guess, we're a Northern city right on the edge of the South, so we get a good mix of people.  I used to really think the mix of Conservative and Liberals was a good thing but holy hell, the last 5 or so years makes me feel very differently about that.  I guess it \*could\* be a good thing, but with the advent of social media bubbles I feel the last 10 years has just gotten worse and worse.  

Oh, and if you're an immigrant from outside of the U.S. from one of those ""desirable"" places (no clue what those really are) but I've had several comments in the last 4 years about being ""one of those good immigrants"".

Otherwise there’s a smattering of condos and townhouses with HOAs that are also quite expensive once total costs are factored in.

Instead, I bought in PWC a couple years ago, suck up the commute, and am saving money faster for our next house than if I rented or ate rice and beans for 6 years.

Your commute would be fairly easy too since you can hop on the 395 if driving and cross the bridge quickly to Arlington, or take the metro.

If it's any consolation:

* Re: safety - the vast majority of people who rob houses don't come back. Although of course your sense of security is shattered, many times these kinds of burglaries are almost professional. They come in, know exactly what they're looking for and leave the place trashed.
* Do you know what they took? Our burglars were focused on guns, jewelry and handbags. They could have totally taken our cars and we saw they opened the drawer with the keys in them, but the cars were untouched and all technology were untouched (didn't steal TVs - an ipad was laying on the coffee table and it was untouched.) Makes us feel a little better that they weren't going to come back and were definitely professional.
   * They even could tell the difference between the real and fake diamonds.
   * They were not interested in any identity theft type things
   * They stole small safes (pro-tip: put airtags in smaller safes that can be transported bc even if they can't access them immediately, they can take them and crack them later)
   * Knowing what they took can help sus out motives and likelihood that they'd be back
* Call the police. Although there's probably not a lot they can do, they can alert local pawn shops. They also brought in a person to sweep for prints (although they didn't find anything.) They also got a guy to come at 2am to board up our massive window that was shattered. Also they were helpful in reassuring us that most likely in our case 1) they wouldn't come back and 2) they were not looking for ID theft stuff and just wanted the guns and jewelry to sell. You will also need a police report for insurance. The cops in our case were also just super nice and understanding and gave us more info on the likely profile of the perpetrators.

For Prevention:

* alarm systems are great, even in apartment buildings. we were dumb and left ours off in a false sense of security so there was a week long window where this could have happened to us and we had no idea
* keep all receipts and list the value of any valuable items you have and would want to get insurance payouts from.
* Take pictures of jewelry/items if you have a lot of them so if it's taken you know. Sometimes you may forget what exactly was stolen
* Airtags in small safes, and understand that small safes are not a deterrent in these situations
* Be wary of who you notify when you're going out of town. People can definitely stalk but pretty much 95% of burglaries I've heard of happens when people are out of town.",18,2023,6,2,1,

Plus they depreciate goods so like one of my handbags that I just got a month prior they were going to reimburse only like 75% so even with insurance you still have to prove a lot of stuff and that can be hard if you can't remember everything that was taken or have paper trails for everything.

We did have the serial numbers to the guns and reported them to the police so if a crime was committed with those guns they were listed as stolen.

The sucky thing was that passports were in the small safe they took, and honestly if they knew it was passports they probably wouldn't have taken it (based on what they did and didn't steal). But that was a NIGHTMARE because we were traveling internationally soon and the rush passport thing is a total shitshow right now.

Fun story - I went there for my college graduation back in 2012. We were CELEBRATING. we were a party of about 12 - my immediate family, my parents best friends, boyfriend at the time and some other people. Needless to say, we spent a lot of money. And we wanted to see the view of the Capitol on the roof. It was a Saturday and there was wedding, but the staff was amazing and was like “you can go up, but you have to come down immediately.” 

We go up and stand to the side to take pictures. And suddenly my dad and his best friend coming running and are like “uh we gotta go”. They had tried to crash the wedding bar! These two boomers in their kahkis and sports coats tried to blend in at a black tie wedding. The bartender was like “name the bride and groom” and they were like “touché” 

So we go downstairs and get ready to call a million cabs bc it’s 2012 and Uber doesn’t exist. And my dad’s friend comes over and says “I got us a ride” and we go, “all of us?” And he goes “yea” 

Well, he had talked to the wedding limo and said “I’ll pay you $100 in cash if you drive us to our hotel and we promise not to touch anything” and the driver said “deal, the bride and groom don’t leave for another 2 hours”. So we took the limo back to the hotel. 

Still one of the most fun nights - and I’ll always have that memory. Sad to see it go - and bummed to see it sit vacant for no reason.",7,2024,11,2,1,

lyw1wbr,1gzcsgu,_fFringe_,"I made a similar move, from Richmond District in San Francisco to Southwest DC, one block south of the beltway. It was… a big change. DC is a very different city and the DMV is a very different type of region than the Bay Area. 

Personally I miss the beaches most of all. If you get the same feeling, and have a car or rent a car, you can drive out to the Chesapeake Bay, which is nice, but there is nothing like Ocean Beach or Stinson Beach. You’d have to drive out about 2-3 hours to get to Delaware or Virginia Beach and even then it’s a totally different vibe. Tons of nice parks and forests in the DMV, though. Just look on maps for green, just outside the city; most of the time it’s a public park. 

There is not a lot of independent movie theaters like in SF, the two to four screen theaters that pepper the Richmond District, not really a thing in DC. But the museums are great and there is a lot of culture here, it’s just a different vibe—not necessarily better or worse, just different. I ended up settling down here, but still miss the west coast.

Oh and the drivers are much worse here than they are in the Bay Area but the traffic is not quite as bad. Public transportation is a million times better in DC, too. Rent is just as high in the Capitol Hill area as it is in SF.

Lots of great restaurants in the city proper but once you get to the suburbs it can drop off pretty quick. Bombay Street Food has the best Indian food, Rasika a close second. Good Mexican food is a bit harder to find, compared to SF; I love Surfside and El Bebe in SW/SE, close to Capitol Hill, but only discovered them the last year before moving to Silver Spring. Sanphan for Thai food in Capital Hill. Good Italian is oddly enough really hard to find. Il Radicchio in Arlington, VA is great, my favorite, but a bit of a drive or train ride from DC. 

Pizza doesn’t compare to San Francisco. There are great pizza places here but it’s a different style altogether. Not a lot of that sloppy molten-cheese-and-sauce SF pizza that I sometimes feel like I would kill for. I adjusted after a year or two, to the restaurants here and am of the opinion that there is quite a lot of great restaurants here.",8,2024,11,2,1,

Keep in mind that, traditionally, law school classes are taught using the ""socratic method,"" which involves calling on people randomly (not waiting for a raise of hands), and then basically humiliating people who cannot answer the question correctly.  So, rough treatment is par for the course in law school.  
However, while law school professors may ridicule an unprepared student for being unprepared, they do not attack the person per se, so they don't regress to calling attention to the physical characteristics of the student.

Woodley/Cleveland Park are both metro accessible, but Glover Park/Cathedral Heights would require a longer walk and/or buses to get around. 

As for price, you're more likely to see studios in your price range in older buildings, but on the plus side they're likely to be rent controlled so your rent won't skyrocket after the first year.

We had a shootout in the hallway. For months we’d been complaining about the stairwell being propped and random people coming and going but they ignored us. 

The story as relayed to me by a neighbor, while we were sitting on the street waiting for the police to finish clearing our floor and collecting evidence:

A local pharmaceutical retailer had his girlfriend rent a unit in the building which he then decked out with food, drinks, tvs and other amenities for his employees. They also lined the walk-in closet with multiple layers of plywood and replaced the closet door so that it could be used to securely store inventory and other supplies. To facilitate easy access to colleagues without keys or fobs they propped the doors and often also left the unit’s door slightly ajar. 

One evening, several employees were enjoying a family meal in the unit. Another employee came from the metro station to deliver inventory and collect the nightly deposit. Unarmed wholesale purchasers followed him up and, temporarily lacking funds, suggested that they take delivery of the just-delivered pharmaceuticals and cash. I’m sure they promised to send over a wire transfer just as soon as their AP department processed the correct forms. 

The delivery guy pulled out a firearm which he then promptly dropped. One of the wholesale purchasers picked up the weapon and promptly shot its owner in the ass for the discourteous behavior. The remainder of the staff then reached for whatever weapons they could find and rushed to empty them in the general direction of the fleeing wholesale buyers. 

The hallway was drenched in blood from the assless guy, who apparently was the only person hit. 

Bozzuto sent a note the next morning that “We were notified of a reported altercation that resulted in one male guest being shot at the property. We are certain you share our concern for this most unfortunate situation. We encourage you to call the police if you have any information related to this incident.” Management skipped the scheduled meeting the next day.",37,2023,9,2,1,

My car was broken into (as has every single other car in my building). The ONLY place they do not have cameras is the resident portion of the garage, which I imagine is by design for one reason or another. When I inquired about the cameras, mgmt told me they feel cameras don't do anything to deter crime, and it would be pointless to have them after the car had already been broken into. What? Besides not making a lick of sense, I guess they've never heard of evidence. 

We've also had an issue with folks sleeping, shooting dope, smoking weed, etc. in the stairwells. The lock was broken on most of the stairway doors, but it took forever to be addressed (if it ever was). That, I don't mind as much as the other shit going on, but I do understand how this is a viable safety issue. Also, the fact that mgmt doesn't care, doesn't address it, and looks for new ways to squeeze money from everyone speaks volumes.

I saw someone attempt to steal a running car right in front of Trader Joe's the other night. This was at 8PM ish, when a lot of people were walkinga round and dining a few feet away. Car pulled up, ski mask guy hopped out and hopped in idling car, owner grabbed him, ski mask guy hopped in getaway car, and they blasted through a red light at 4th and Fla. This could have gone downhill fast had a firearm come into the equation.

If you look at MPD reports, there have been a lot of carjackings and armed robberies right around Union Market (and NoMa). Of course, none of the buildings will ever give residents a heads up. They just don't give a fuck. All they care about is jacking up rent and ignoring resident requests.

But seeing comments like ""the people doing drugs on the stairwell don’t bother me generally since they keep to themselves"" makes me think, why the fuck does it not bother you? Get fucking bothered. 

And while your building management may respond to incidents well, or not well, they are not the root cause of these issues, and complaining to them is not going to make any issues from the surroundings go away. If your building management was perfect, the most they could do is keep it just beyond the property line. It's an error to think they are the cause or the solution. 

These are large, cyclical problems that resist quick solutions. You feel unsafe because you are unsafe. It didn't happen overnight and it's not going to go away overnight.

-If everyone in DC acted like I do (not rape people, not assault people, not kill people) it would be literally *perfectly* safe. It's insane to blame me for a crime wave.    

-Government exists for a reason, and the very initial reason for the founding of government was to protect citizens from violence. They're barely trying. We (with or without consent) have given them a legal monopoly on violence to do so on our behalf to keep the weak, vulnerable and helpless safe. Now that we've given them money, authority, weaponry, and a mandate you're telling me that DC is violent because the people I pay and authorize to protect it are only really window dressing. And that me and my fellow citizens need to be 'more engaged' in the community?  
Bull shit. If I'm going to be responsible then DC needs to send me back my taxes, close the schools, fire all the teachers and cops and pull down the government buildings. Either they take the lead and accept responsibility for their (many) failures or they stop this fucking playing both sides. Are they on the job or is 'the community' supposed to pull all the weight?

>every single system and person that individual came into contact with failed them.  


What a joke. You're saying that the people committing murder on a daily basis in DC aren't responsible for their actions. But I am responsible for their actions.

See, I've identified your problem.  

The common problem among progressives is that they choose to theorize and attempt to break new ground rather than looking at what.. ya know.. actually *works*. As an example: DCPS is the most expensive per-student school system in the nation. It's also one of the worst. So what do all progressives in DC suggest we do? More of the same. More money! Because when they *think about it* more money should help. They've simulated it in their powerful brains, and they know the outcome. Sure, in 3 generations their super smart kids will still be fighting the same battles, but at least they won't have to admit failure, right? It's like the military industrial complex on steroids, seeing as how we spend *vastly* more on education and social programs than we do on war.  

I see you refused to answer why DC and a few other deep blue cities are the ones experiencing crime waves while all the yokels in those backwards red states are spending less, imprisoning less, policing less and still getting vastly better outcomes. But to the progressive Washingtonian, trying something new that might work, but that also might need to use someone else's old school idea is abhorrent. ""Always forward! Always progress! Always failure as well, but hey! At least we're moving *forward* and trying new things!

*But the simple truth is that, at a minimum, 55 percent of those in state prison have been convicted of a violent crime — and more than half of these people, or nearly 30 percent of the total prison population, have been found guilty of murder, manslaughter, rape or sexual assault, according to the* [*Bureau of Justice Statistics*](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/p17.pdf)*. Slightly less than 15 percent are incarcerated for drug crimes, even though most Americans* [*believe*](https://www.vox.com/2016/9/7/12814504/mass-incarceration-poll) *the figure to be about 50 percent. (Drugs play a bigger role in the federal prison system, but that holds only about 10 percent of all prisoners; most incarcerated people are in state prison.)*

*The share of those in state prison for committing violence is even greater than 55 percent, however. Prisoners are classified by the most serious offense for which they are convicted, not arrested or charged. So if someone is arrested for a violent crime but ends up pleading guilty to a drug charge, his crime is classified as a nonviolent drug offense, even if the underlying incident — like a domestic violence case in which the victim won’t testify — is the reason the prosecutor sought prison time.*",3,2020,11,2,1,

gdheifb,k03gu6,rasputin777,"> Rural crime is through the roof. 

Oh yeah? I just picked three of the most rural states off the top of my head.  
Montana's homicide rate last year was 2.5. Wyoming's was 2.2. South Dakota's was 1.9.  
DC's was 166.
**Forcible rape:**  
SD: 72.6
DC: 345
**All violent crime:**
SD: 399
DC: 7,403


If ""Through the roof"" means a woman is *five times* as likely to get raped in DC than in rural South Dakota... then sign me up for 'through the roof'.  


>The opioid crisis has been raging for years in red states.  

Again, not at all true. Opioids are killing far more people in the NE and rust belt states than 'red' states. The top ten includes Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Hampshire, and Delaware. Not very red, eh?  

>We’re repairing and building everything you all broke or didn’t care to think about.  
You're repairing things? And during this repair we get an extra hundred deaths over the last two years? Who broke what? It's been deep blue control of DC for almost a century now. DC brags about how it's the most progressive city and the voting patterns back that up. Just because progs can't get shit done given 80 years doesn't mean you'll be able to given another lost generation.

-""Why did you describe the alleged perp? Now the police might kill them!"" / or ""It's just your wallet/car/cell phone bro, just get over it! They probably need it more than you, or come from a broken home and it's our fault!""

gdkpu6a,k03gu6,dcmcg,"I don't think that's true either. For example, [even if you discount all drug offenders in state and federal prisons we still have the highest incarceration rate in the world](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/releasing-drug-offenders-wont-end-mass-incarceration/), and one that is significantly higher than all our western counterparts.

We seem to have such a high incarceration rate for two reasons: 1) we have more people committing serious crimes than other countries and 2) we have more significant penalties for those crimes.

We can go at this all day and you might be better researched on some numbers to support you, but I guess it just fundamentally comes down to I want to at least try to help everyone and hold ourselves to a higher standard then locking people away and destroying more lives.

gdhhk1f,k03gu6,rasputin777,">I guess it just fundamentally comes down to I want to at least try to help everyone and hold ourselves to a higher standard then locking people away and destroying more lives.  

100%! I do too!  

I'm not at all against CJR in any way, shape, or form. My bone with the council is that they're spending a lot more time on easing life for 'returning citizens' than they are for the people those same citizens have assaulted, raped and murdered.  

It's not like DC has victims well taken care of. Like I mentioned earlier, I live in a neighborhood that has very recently become rough once again. Rapes, carjacked delivery drivers, etc. I am friends/family with several assault victims. Once the police take their report, they roll out and that's it. One of the victims got a card for a counselor to call. The number went to busy each time it was tried. After spending some time researching it, the victim discovered that DC claims that victims of violent crimes can get their medical bills paid. (in this case a fractured eye socket and broken rib). Guess what? 2 years later and DC is fighting to not pay. And this is a story that I've heard a hundred times.  

So what's the council doing? Passing a bill of rights for victim's of violent crime? Nope! They're trying to reduce sentencing for the small number of people that actually end up serving time. It's fucking ludicrous.  

And in any case, I don't see how any prog can handwave away the awful stats we have. (not that you are). Most of the victims of homicide are black. Most of the victims of rape are women. The crime wave isn't hurting wealthy white men. It's hurting minorities, and when anyone objects to the city's awful leadership everyone pretends they're some gentrifying force and just need to 'deal with' the crime as part of living in a city. Hell, I've had conversations where people are *proud* of the violence around them, like it makes them a badass to have their neighbors raped.  

But yes, I think we're on the same team. I want justice for everyone. But we should prioritize victims over offenders.",3,2020,11,2,1,

I used to get my haircut there 2x a month because it was the cheapest I could find and despite being accustomed to environments others would call “sketch” (hate that term.

Sadly, all cities have areas that are higher crime vs others, that's why looking at stats for the whole city is informative but can lead you to draw wrong conclusion (ie whole city is violent, vs pockets of violence).

As for comparing a city to a suburb, well sure, you are more likely to be a victim of crime in DC than in a suburb. But that is an odd comparison since more people usually leads to more crime, all else being equal. Someone who is used to rural living might find your sleepy suburb a hot bed of vice and violence.

Finally, it's funny how we normalize certain violence while emphasizing other violence. For example, you are far far more likely to die in a vehicle crash than you are to die being shot during a violent event. In fact, American roads have become far deadlier in the past few years.

DC is a “big” city so obviously with that comes characteristics typical of city living, but CoHi is still a neighborhood I just don’t feel super safe in alone. Even during the day it just feels chaotic, mostly by the metro station, because it’s a very busy area with a lot going on. Plenty of young people obviously live there but personally it’s not for me. If you were living with roommates it might make a difference in how “safe” you feel, but if you’re living alone and have the flexibility of being able to look in other neighborhoods I might consider doing so.

That said, many of the nearby neighborhoods are more sedate and pleasant to live in IMO. Within the past month, in CH I've seen a man overdosing during midday, a women being harrassed and physically assaulted by a man she didn't know in broad daylight (she had to duck into a business to escape and then be walked to the bus station by good-samaritans), and very aggressive begging (like following people for a block and banging on cars stopped at traffic lights).

Unless you are commuting out of the city, you probably won't really need to use that metro stop. 

When I lived at 13th, I would only use u street metro as it was basically the same distance.

h9vl4o4,p90h2e,ncblake,"Nearly 7 year Columbia Heights resident here: This comment section is pretty misleading and one-sided. 

The thing to know is that Columbia Heights is the most dense and most diverse neighborhood in the city. There are young professionals, young families, born-and-raised Black residents, a large Hispanic community, and everything else you can imagine. It’s one of the busier and louder neighborhoods. It has the most convenient transit access in the city. There are Michelin restaurants just blocks away from public housing. You’ll see homelessness and addiction, as well as privilege and luxury living. It’s all here. 

If you’ve lived in a “big city” of any kind, there won’t be much you haven’t seen before. Columbia Heights does rank fairly high in terms of crime data, but it’s largely highly localized violence between individuals who are known to one another. If you’re minding your own business and generally cognizant of your surroundings, it isn’t much more dangerous than any other neighborhood aside from the absolute wealthiest places in the city. 

I’ve always felt that there’s “safety in numbers” in Columbia Heights. Yes, there’s always the risk of being a bystander, but crimes like stick-ups, robberies, etc that target DC’s “professional” crowd tend to be more prevalent in neighborhoods with less foot traffic, in my experience. 

I will say that I don’t think you’ve picked the best blocks in the neighborhood. Neither is “bad” per-se, but you’ll have to cross some of the more infamous blocks to get from those two places to somewhere like the Metro or grocery store. 13th and Clifton, in particular, I wouldn’t recommend for this reason. Further north and closer to 16th St/Mt Pleasant would be safer bets.

h9xkbw2,p90h2e,Barkmywords,"This is very true in CH. 11st corridor (11th and Irving to Monroe) is super nice. One of the better neighborhoods in DC IMO. Really nice restaurants and the dive bar Wonderland. Near an elementary school, dog park. 

Love living there. However, a few blocks down to Columbia and 14th, you have a ton of crimes and I wouldnt walk there alone at night.",25,2021,8,2,1,
h9uqwnn,p90h2e,713ryan713,"Chaotic - that's THE perfect word.

Skip it. I'm a 250 pound man in his 30s and don't feel tremendously safe there, and I'm a ""city person"" (or at least used to be one when I lived there ten years ago). 

I feel people pay a premium to live there because of the restaurants and Metro, but I always felt like it was strange to pay more for an area that's not super safe.",108,2021,8,2,1,

jr08ete,p90h2e,Playful-Monk,hey sorry to comment on this a year later but do you have any thoughts on 16th st/lamont? Moving to DC and I’m looking at an apartment here. Any thoughts on that intersection from a safety perspective?,1,2023,7,2,1,
ha1zmpt,p90h2e,CaptainObvious110,"Exactly. Why are people so lazy?  Moving is a major thing especially when it's a new city.  Having done this a few years ago I know what that's like for sure.  

Before I moved I spent time in Baltimore and explored different areas before I ended up where I am.  But when I was first looking for a place people were getting them left and right sight unseen and my mom and I thought it was the dumbest thing ever.

In addition I joined the local subreddit and also read up on the history and that was really helpful to me.

As a result I live a really good life with no regrets.",7,2021,8,2,1,
h9wslw0,p90h2e,mks221,"This is interesting because as a woman who lives at 13th and Clifton I will only walk on 13th at night. It feels way safer than 14th. 

I’ve never had an issue with the gatherings at 14th and Clifton, though, and if I do have to walk east I feel like Clifton is safer than many of the streets north of it. I’d certainly walk down it instead of the 1300 block of Girard, for example.",9,2021,8,2,1,

I’m over by H st. now. I’m not sure if it’s because I recently purchased a home, but it feels much more communal.",14,2021,8,2,1,
h9wb0pp,p90h2e,maleolive,"Same. I’ve lived in CH, Petworth, and Park View and I always felt very safe in Park View. It was also very quiet and a short ride/walk to other destinations.",6,2021,8,2,1,

h9vfzob,p90h2e,fuzzysocks1357,Hey OP I lived in Columbia heights for the past year and this is pretty much how I feel. I personally never felt unsafe and I never had anything happen (also 20s female) but I know some of my friends who visited me didn’t feel as safe. I’d recommend it if you are comfortable with city living.,14,2021,8,2,1,
h9vmf41,p90h2e,themagicisin3,"Yeah same. I’ve lived in CoHi / Mt P for a decade, walk alone at night as a tiny woman all the time, etc. Street harassment happens everywhere but I’ve honestly never felt unsafe here. I HAVE been stalked in Park View AND Cleveland Park and felt really unsafe with no businesses or other people on the street to help me. I got mugged at knifepoint in AdMo a few years ago. I’ve had drunk white frat guys try to grope me in Shaw. I guess I’m trying to say that if you are used to city life, cohi is (pretty much) as safe as any NW neighborhood, and problem areas in many neighborhoods are really just certain blocks. 

I just wish the people who bring amps & mics & scream about Jesus in front of the metro would take it down a notch. It’s too loud!",20,2021,8,2,1,
h9vwkld,p90h2e,Meccha_me_2,"I grew up in Philly, but Columbia Heights was too much for me last year. Too many day shootings and harassment for a location that has multiple schools, is consistently crowded, and is close to some of the best restaurants/nightlife in the city.
The problems there just don’t make sense and are very unpredictable as a result. I’m Philly I knew where not to go and when, and otherwise, I was safe. Not the same in DC",6,2021,8,2,1,
ha1mr2m,p90h2e,CaptainObvious110,Ooh I wouldn't live there and I am a DC native. I once had a buddy that lived over there.,4,2021,8,2,1,
ha1x7hp,p90h2e,CaptainObvious110,"See that's the thing. If you come across as afraid of your shadow then you are more likely to have a problem and that's what people do not get at all.

I am from DC and I remember guys catcalling my mom on a constant basis and I absolutely hated it.  To this day when a guy does that it is really annoying to me and im a man myself.  

But if you do as the locals do and pay it no mind and go on about your business you should be just fine.  

What I wish was the case is if people would learn how to deal with situations like this so its not such a big deal.",3,2021,8,2,1,
