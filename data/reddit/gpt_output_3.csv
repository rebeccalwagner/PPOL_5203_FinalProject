Theft isn't violent crime. Theft =/= unsafe.

But you'd have to read anything anyone else says or any of the articles posted rather than rely on your own half formed opinion to know that.

Yes, I live in DC. Walking distance from the CH CVS, actually. As others have ALREADY STATED, but you of course didn't read because you're just here to see yourself type, there are two other pharmacies within a block of the CH CVS, and several others, including other CVS, within walking distance.

I get exhausted watching your rant about shit you refuse to know anything about and make everything about crime. This was planned. This is how CVS operates.
