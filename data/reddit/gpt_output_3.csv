State income tax is higher in DC but it’s not that much. Sales tax in the DMV is relatively the same. VA has some screwy alcohol taxes and given my consumption, I feel I pay less even though the DC tax is ~10%.",4,2024,12,1,1,

35,5042,5140,m0m2nev,1h7dozg,CatsWineLove,Really? Tell my tax man then because I have never paid property tax on either of my vehicles and I’ve lived here for over 20 years. I do pay for my residential parking permit though so it’s kind of like a property tax! Please provide the source of your statement. I think you may be confusing it with an excise tax that is applied to new vehicles that you buy but I’ll wait to see what you’re referring to.,5,2024,12,1,1,
