But I must admit that I really enjoy coming back to this sub and watching as folk try to argue [checks front page] that a group of people attacking an Uber driver on U St is completely normal and everyone should just ""grow a fucking spine.""",37,2024,5,1,1,

42,5049,5148,l6ccm2v,1d474to,JelloSquirrel,"Definitely doesn't need to be hyperbolic but we don't have to stick our heads in the sand either.


DC has a real crime problem and the statistics support that it's top 5 in violent crime in the nation (maybe top 3 by now) and top 50 in violent crime in the entire world. Additionally, violent crime is up several hundred percent from about 10ish years ago, a long with all other crime.


I think an important part of civic engagement is to recognize there are problems, they are worse problems than other cities are facing, and we can work together to fix these issues but first we have to acknowledge the issues rather than gaslighting people into thinking the issues don't exist or matter.",21,2024,5,1,1,

It’s almost like they want to use it as a cover to dehumanize people.

There’s nothing wrong with talking about crime. There is everything wrong with making it a racial issue.",7,2024,5,1,1,

48,5055,5154,l6co450,1d474to,Icy_Abbreviations877,"I live right outside DC (Suitland to Clinton area). 
I am a single black woman/mother. 

My car was just shot up 3 weeks ago. 

I am not affiliated with any types of crime nor have any beef for anyone to shoot at me much less my car. 

My significant other’s family member was shot and killed in DC two months ago (granted he is in the street life so we expected it). 

Between my experiences and seeing how many people are also dealing with violence, I am saying DC is a war zone. I am looking for places to move and it has been challenging…",8,2024,5,1,1,
