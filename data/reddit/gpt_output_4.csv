1,5208,5313,kjziq2s,1ad5zu5,Gaijin_Monster,"Scared of what?  Look, you really need to actually take time to understand what's happening here and apply some critical thinking skills.  I'm wondering if you've ever actually worked in a retail or grocery business at all.  Because if you had, it would be strikingly obvious to you.  

 This whole situation has been developing for a couple of years, and there's loads reported and written about it.  You can go online, see law enforcement talk about it.  You can see national reports that acknowledge what's happening.  You can see Target openly talking about it from the national level.  And then you can see CVS trying to be non-confrontational as possible and dip out un-noticed. They use words like ""reconsolidating"" and ""corporate strategy."" Walmart did the same thing until they could shut down the stores without confrontation and then afterwards  they were honest about what was happening.

In 2022 Target as a whole had a 57% drop in operating income, and in 2023 lost something like $500 million due to theft.  CH Target is dying fast, holding on for dear life.  Super obvious with the goods they're chosing to lock up and the fact people under 18 need an adult escort now.  And to me what really stands out as another indiciator is what they're choosing and NOT choosing to restock as an attempt to recover profits.   I know this from working in the grocery business, and also we saw the same death throws from H Street Walmart before it closed.

CVS sees this and they're getting out now.

I'm just going to block you now.  I pray to God you aren't in charge of anything important.",1,2024,1,1,1,"1

13,5220,5326,kjth76q,1abwq88,Westboundandhow,"DC has really shot itself in the foot economically by letting crime proliferate. People are going to stop buying there, and like you said just move across the river where it's safer. I am a prime example. I left DC last month after 4 years, primarily due to safety concerns. The past couple years I was looking for condos to buy in DC, ready willing and able, going to open houses every weekend etc, but hesitated specifically bc of the growing crime problem. After a couple years going back and forth, I decided to take my money elsewhere and buy somewhere I actually feel safe. Aka not DC. 

Two close friends also left DC this past year for the same reason, and will ultimately buy elsewhere as well. People are not going to pay $500k for a 1br condo they don't feel safe leaving. Virginia is safer bc Virginia is tough on crime. It's that simple. Enough with the soft on crime legislation in DC. It's going to tank property values. I feel bad for people who purchased there recently. I'm so glad I didn't. I'm so glad I left.",7,2024,1,1,1,"1

I am a 20 year military vet still serving in the DMV or as we refer to it the MDW (Military District of Washington). The DC does not allow me to conceal carry in any manner within the district.  While I am a military police officer and am eligible for my LEOSA carry permit, I have not completed all the requirements; nor do I feel really comfortable with the reality that I may need to use a firearm against my own countrymen.  

In my military history, I have been perfectly comfortable with going on combat patrol where I or one of my soldiers may pay the ultimate price for our efforts.  However, I monitor these channels and I don‚Äôt not feel comfortable proceeding into the district unarmed when my family is at stake.  There are some areas of DC we will simply NOT go.  This level of lawlessness cannot go unanswered. I have been reading about teenagers robbing people of their coats and jackets with assault rifles in DC and I am supposed to feel comfortable bringing my eight year old daughter into the city?

DC used to compete with Detroit every year as the murder capital of the country.  Complaining about car break ins is not going to be considered that big of a deal.  The idea that crime is on the rise is not correct.  Violent crime has been going down nationwide.  Crime is a very complex issue and one of the main drivers of criminal behavior is income inequality and a lack of opportunity.  I don't know anything about this omnibus bill but I hope it addresses these issues and doesn't just call for more mass incarceration.,0,2024,1,1,1,"1
