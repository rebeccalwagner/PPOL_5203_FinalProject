Instead of acknowledging that their FELLOW CITIZENS are in crisis and we should probably address that to address the crime, it's just an all or nothing: either there's no crime happening, or there's a massive amount and we need to ""get rid of those people"" to fix it 

There's a shocking amount of crime happening (I'm born and raised) but also maybe people need to get off the high horse and actually address things like massive income inequality???",4,2024,5,1,1,

I've lived in NYC, too, and honestly, I am kinda surprised by the amount of crime posting and complaining. Like I get the frustration, but also, is it really that bad? And if you feel it is, maybe instead of doom posting about it, get engaged in your community to make change. Be part of the solution, not part of the problem. Because division is the problem. I've had a couple of sketchy interactions over the years, but that's par for the course of living in a big city. If you stay aware and prepared, DC is as safe as any other big city.",2,2024,5,1,1,

56,5063,5163,l6d6cl9,1d474to,Substantial_Bet_3351,Tf is wrong with you. It is a warzone dummy. People in America have a right to want to change unjust laws. Why should I move out of my home as a law abiding citizen when people who are not law abiding citizens and belong in a prison jump suit are terrorizing my home. They need to go to get up out of here by going to prison not me.,0,2024,5,1,1,
