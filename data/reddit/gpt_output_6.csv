Second, fuck all that. Crime in the city is rampant, there are tents everywhere and most metro stations are absolutely filthy. 

We live in DC because there are jobs in DC, and we have the right to complain about the substandard living conditions throughout the city. As you stated, the city is expensive af and we all deserve better. 

You’ll understand this more once you’re done with college and start paying your own bills in a $2,800/mo apartment overlooking a shantytown.",0,2024,5,1,1,

And this is cvs’s business model: open a bunch of stores, drive everyone else out of the business, then consolidate when there is no more competition. Same thing they did in San Francisco. Loudly, they leaked the reason was ‘crime’ but when the ceo and cfo were under penalty of perjury in their earnings call, they said it was planned consolidation in a saturated market. In most of these areas, there is no one else to take up the slack, people have to travel. I have to go a mile and a half to get my prescription already. And that’s for a common blood pressure med. cvs knows they won’t lose any money, because people who need their scrips will go farther to get them, there’s no real alternative.",58,2024,1,1,1,

65,5072,5173,kjyu44g,1ad5zu5,nerfedname,">The article says crime is not the reason, but we know DC media are scared to report the truth.  

They are? I see articles about crime every single day. Multiple times a day in fact.   

And even within this article they mention rampant shoplifting as the impetus for the Columbia Heights store closing. They mention crime directly in the very article you claim is being coy because they’re “scared to report to the truth.”  

The quote from the resident says there are other stores with “3 or 4 blocks,” this seems like a retail overload problem (in a world changing to online shopping and prescription drug delivery services) and not a crime problem. Especially considering the retailer specifically says its part of their plan to reduce retail density (and quoted in the article).",10,2024,1,1,1,

The one nearest me was only useful as a UPS drop off then they started telling me I couldn't drop off anything larger than a certain size, any box that wouldn't fit on a shelf, so there was no reason to go there.",4,2024,1,1,1,
68,5075,5176,kjyvh3b,1ad5zu5,plastertoes,"I mean CVS announced they’re closing hundreds of stores nationally this year, but sure let’s blame that on Columbia Heights too. 

“CVS, the largest US chain, closed 244 stores between 2018 and 2020. In 2021, it announced plans to close 900 stores by 2024.”

I think we all agree more resources need to be devoted to fighting crime in DC, but let’s not try to claim everything is crime related when DC experiences national trends. You’re grasping at straws.  ",9,2024,1,1,1,
