81,5088,5190,kk0twke,1ad5zu5,Westboundandhow,"Political pressure. A tale as old as time. When the city knows it has a major crime problem on its hands and resulting exodus of a new wave of WFH professionals who don't have to deal w this shit anymore, it will try to craft a more appealing narrative to subdue its peons. Anything but actual change to make it better.",6,2024,1,1,1,
82,5089,5191,kjz7tgx,1ad5zu5,Smooth-Mobile-272,"Ideology. Agenda. Being biased. They don’t wanna say the crime is high because of the ideology of the mayor and the city council who don’t want tough penalties for robbers, looters, murderers, violent teens.",5,2024,1,1,1,

>The latest announced closings come just days after CVS said it would close its Columbia Heights location. The store has been the scene of rampant shoplifting

It’s right there, you don’t even have to scroll.",1,2024,1,1,1,
85,5092,5194,kjyvzzy,1ad5zu5,UltraSPARC,"This is not new news either. They announced in 2021 well before this sub existed and was obsessed with DC crime that they were shutting down 900 retail stores and 1,800 target pharmacies nationwide. This isn’t even sensationalism from OP, it’s misleading at best and has nothing to do with actual crime that’s occurring in DC.",25,2024,1,1,1,
86,5093,5195,kjyvihs,1ad5zu5,,Yeah OP is trying to pin this on crime but this is just CVS being CVS in this case.,9,2024,1,1,1,
87,5094,5196,kjz2epx,1ad5zu5,Gaijin_Monster,"Is your head really up your ass that far?  What small business pharmacy did they ""drive out of business?"" If you think it has nothing to do with crime... well you must not live here, because it's clear you're out of touch.  No one but a large pharmacy corporation is going to move into these areas.  Losing these CVSs was earned, not some kind of tragedy. Weren't you think the same redditor defending criminals fleeing from the police?",-9,2024,1,1,1,

Edit: why the fuck am I getting downvoted for asking a real question?",-6,2024,1,1,1,
89,5096,5198,kjzl0il,1ad5zu5,,There's no 'pentalty of perjury'(?) in an earnings call. That's about on par with the accuracy of the rest of your statements.,1,2024,1,1,1,
