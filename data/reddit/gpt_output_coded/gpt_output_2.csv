m0kv52k,1h7dozg,Derpolitik23,"Yes, Arlington’s crime rate is lower than DC's, even though crime and related problems have become more prevalent in post-COVID Arlington.

Even though I work in DC, I chose to live in Arlington because the housing is comparatively cheaper and more modern than what’s often available in my price range in DC.

Also, better amenities like parking and more things to choose from (ex. More grocery stores available in DC are things like Safeway and Whole Foods), while within a five mile radius of where I live in Arlington I have many more choices. Even within walking distance.

Though, I would say NIMBYISM is a bigger problem in Arlington vs. DC. I think VA taxes from what I've heard are also more than the District.",18,2024,12,1,1,"1, 6"

kjziq2s,1ad5zu5,Gaijin_Monster,"Scared of what?  Look, you really need to actually take time to understand what's happening here and apply some critical thinking skills.  I'm wondering if you've ever actually worked in a retail or grocery business at all.  Because if you had, it would be strikingly obvious to you.  

 This whole situation has been developing for a couple of years, and there's loads reported and written about it.  You can go online, see law enforcement talk about it.  You can see national reports that acknowledge what's happening.  You can see Target openly talking about it from the national level.  And then you can see CVS trying to be non-confrontational as possible and dip out un-noticed. They use words like ""reconsolidating"" and ""corporate strategy."" Walmart did the same thing until they could shut down the stores without confrontation and then afterwards  they were honest about what was happening.

In 2022 Target as a whole had a 57% drop in operating income, and in 2023 lost something like $500 million due to theft.  CH Target is dying fast, holding on for dear life.  Super obvious with the goods they're chosing to lock up and the fact people under 18 need an adult escort now.  And to me what really stands out as another indiciator is what they're choosing and NOT choosing to restock as an attempt to recover profits.   I know this from working in the grocery business, and also we saw the same death throws from H Street Walmart before it closed.

The past couple years I was looking for condos to buy in DC, ready willing and able, going to open houses every weekend etc, but hesitated specifically bc of the growing crime problem. After a couple years going back and forth, I decided to take my money elsewhere and buy somewhere I actually feel safe. Aka not DC. 

Two close friends also left DC this past year for the same reason, and will ultimately buy elsewhere as well. People are not going to pay $500k for a 1br condo they don't feel safe leaving. Virginia is safer bc Virginia is tough on crime. It's that simple. Enough with the soft on crime legislation in DC. It's going to tank property values.

There was a New Deal Era public housing project—segregated for *whites* only from 1941 to 1953–known as Ellen Wilson Dwellings that replaced homes occupied predominantly by white residents to the east and west, and in greater numbers about 300 blacks who had primarily been living in substandard alley dwellings for decades.

It gradually fell into disrepair until residents were relocated in1988. It was demolished in 1996 for redevelopment as mixed-income rowhouses (Ellen Wilson Homes). It occupied basically one large block berween G and I Streets and 6th and 7th Streets SE, intersected by Navy Place (Alley).

Potomac Gardens is a public housing complex for families and seniors built in the mid-1960s. It has its issues, but is not by any definition a slum.

It’s a physical and violent act above and beyond a mere threat.

I don’t disagree that it can be construed as an assault under DC law, which is one of those jurisdictions that convolutes assault and battery. In states that do not, this would unquestionably be an assault but not a battery. Batteries are what you get when there *is* a physical attack.

A battery does, of course, but one can be “attacked” through attempted physical actions such as lunging with a machete intending to commit a battery. That wasn’t on my mind here because it still wasn’t such an attack. There was a mere brandishing with verbal threat. An assault, but not an attack, either attempted or actual.

In the common parlance, if you say someone was “attacked” that means something more than whipping out a machete and making verbal threats.

But American civilization, American society, it is heavily corrupted. And split. 

I’m not talking about liberal vs conservative bullshit.

Patriotism is a critical element in a country. Something needs to keep a society together, and be the glue of civilizations. Doesn’t matter if it’s nationalism, religion, or language. Heck, it can even be political. A uniparty that everyone is a part of. 

People keep saying differences should be celebrated. Sure, but unity is more important. 

What’s a nation? There needs to be something that unites all Americans. Doesn’t matter their race, their ethnicity, their religion. 

My solution, if I were tasked with solving this problem in one generation: As much as I hate Communism and the USSR, the Soviet “komsomol” (youth party) was a good idea, and helped unify the USSR which was composed of 140 very different ethnicities. 

At age 18, force all citizens to participate two years in an American nationwide organization. Not military. But rather civilian work. Cross-states cooperation. Have kids that grew up in inner Baltimore be flown out to North Dakota and work with kids from Texas on building solar panel farms and parks. 

Completely interconnect the whole country from the youth level. 

Force people to leave their little silos and echo chambers and assimilate amongst each other. 

Military can be good for this, but this needs to be (1) civilian, and (2) mandatory. 

Government needs to be much more involved in the development of youth. This hands off approach is disastrous.

You want to make this about race but it's not, at least not for me.  I've lived in communities where most of the people were white and there were still crime concerns.  I've lived in communities where most of the people were latino and there were still crime concerns.  Violent crime and especially gun crime puts everyone at risk, it's not good to wake up in the middle of the night with someone shooting at their opps in the alley 15 feet outside of your kids' bedroom no matter what the shooter's race is.  Losing businesses because of crime hurts the entire community.  Your comments make absolutely zero sense to me and do not serve any useful purpose whatsoever.",4,2024,4,1,1,"1,2"

Even though it is down, violent crime is a serious problem in DC that does deserve discussion, and the mods from the other sub were shutting down discussions when there was a serious issue with it, and there were absolutely grounds to discuss it. Violent crime is not unique to DC but people should be allowed to openly discuss it. Many of the people who were bringing it up absolutely do live in the city. Again, if the restrictions on the main sub didn't exist, this sub wouldn't exist. But this is also why this sub is more focused on crime issues within the city. Because it was largely created to discuss those issues based on moderator behavior. Don't expect this sub to be any less focused, or for it to be censored where it is not the main topic of conversation on this sub.

Yes, that “feeling” has definitely continued to escalate since you left, but there is *also* a selection bias component to it.

Loved all the events, like Embassy Day, Solstice Saturday, festivals, etc. There were times I would go on 4-6 mile walks around the city as a single female.  I lived really close to Rock Creek Park which was super helpful. But after COVID something just fundamentally felt different. You mentioned the word lawlessness and that's how I would describe it too.  

When I first moved to the city I was in Columbia Heights a lot and then I'm not sure what exactly happened but it just seemed like it wasn't night time that stuff was happening there anymore.  I used to take the bus there and I didn't really feel safe waiting for it anymore.  U St. which was always crazy felt different crazy.  There was a sniper shooting in Van Ness where bullets actually hit my neighborhood a mile away. I saw teenage kids throw a bottle at a guy just for being Hispanic on the escalator.  Had a teenager get in my face on the Metro because how dare I say something about them taking up (laying down) on seats for the elderly who needed them.  So many of these things just over and over. It's city fatigue.

At least one ranking site puts Baltimore above DC in terms of safety. Both are near the bottom of the list. 

I think it is still very block to block in terms of targeted violence that might spill over (drug markets and drive bys) and you can significantly impact your susceptibility to carjackings, assaults and robberies by not driving a desirable vehicle, being careful where/when you fill up gas, avoiding high school arrival and dismissal time on the metro and bus (mostly just teens are unruly with a chance of witnessing or being a victim of random assault) and not being out near clubs and bars after midnight. 

I worry for my family often but theres things that minimize our risks. My partner works in Adams Morgan but during daytime its fine, neither of us drive cars that get stolen often to ever, I use a cheapo ugly bike to get around, my kids go to school in a very low crime area in a DCPS school with minimal to no major safety events and I reverse commute to work. Where we live in Petworth, is least safe out of everything we can control, but we are working on finding a more peaceful/safer block/neighborhood soon. In the meantime we are proactive when crimes start to tick up on our block and work with police whenever we witness anything serious or can be helpful to an investigation",2,2023,10,1,1,"1,5"

I’m on this sub myself because the other DC sub won’t let discussion of crime occur. So I’m part of the skew. But know that most of the answers you’ll get are from people here for the same reason. 

Although I’ve lived in DC since 2014, I have been out of the country for a number of months and just seeing news and discussion threads has me worried about going back. But then I have to remember when I was living there just 6 months ago I didn’t feel ‘the danger’ despite living in the H St NE area. I don’t drive tho - I think I’d feel the carjacking risk. 

That said, I have always taken precautions - i.e. don’t have all of my money / phone / cards in the same pocket in case I get mugged and hope I can get away with just handing them some of it, avoid walking close to groups of people just hanging around, immediately lock my door behind me as soon as getting inside, had a mental plan in my head of what I’d do if threatened/attacked, etc. So maybe if I hadn’t always done that sort of thing I’d feel the need to start now. 

We rent our house out while we’re out of town, and all of our guests have reported feeling safe in the neighborhood. Because they’re just seeing with their eyes rather than following crime stats. 

The one thing I’d recommend against is buying a place right now. Come and rent for a year or three and feel out neighborhoods for yourself, as they have changed and still are. I would consider staying in DC proper when your kid is 3-4 to take advantage of the free Pre-K.",4,2023,10,1,1,"1,6"

Another Wharf restaurant recently had their front glass shot out.

There was a daytime shooting on the Wharf near the sports betting that had outdoor brunch diners (including infants, there were knocked over highchairs) rushing to take cover. 

Several parents have been attacked while with kids/infants on Capitol Hill, including in broad daylight.

There was a recent carjacking in AM/Lanier Heights in daylight behind the back gate of the zoo by armed kids, 10-12, at least one had a gun. 

etc., etc.

I've lived here since early 90s, with kids, including in some of the places you mention, OP. It is really different now. And the crime is much more random and often involves people jumping out of stolen cars to rob or carjack at gunpoint, hard to avoid that when out and about, kwim?  

With a baby/child, there is buckling them into car seats, getting them out of the car, being slowed walking by pushing a stroller, etc., makes you more vulnerable to crime. What is the upside in risking it? There is increased violent crime on WMATA, including during peak fares, at stations like Metro Center, Gallery Place, LF.

k5ks8q4,17bcxz5,AnonyJustAName,"Have you had multiple kids in multiple DC schools over time yourself? The quality has changed in recent years even at what you term ""exceptional schools"" in DC. It's truly unfortunate.

With kids, often ""start as you mean to go on"" is useful. For OP, not struggling with possibly being underwater in mortgage, etc., family can easily get established in burbs, meet other parents with babies, build relationships with neighbors and can settle in one area with less concerns re: safety of family.

As someone whose family planned to stick it out in DC and DCPS, beginning in another era, now is not that time. OP will likely end up moving anyway, the trends are not reversing. It's disruptive to relationships and those are good to build as a family. In burbs almost all kids go to neighborhood school, can play outside, it's a very different life and in many ways a lot less stressful, not just because of crime. In DC there are less families on the block and the kids may all go to different schools. If kids go to a charter school may pull from all over the city and involve a lot of driving to playdates, bday parties, etc. There is less community. In burbs the communities for families are around the neighborhood school almost completely.

Should your kid be advanced or have learning issues or some sn, those will likely be better addressed in burbs, it's just the reality, and that is based on personal experience with ""exceptional"" upper NW DCPS over time. People sometimes end up scrambling. There is a also the fact that VA and MD offer high quality in state more affordable options for higher education which DC lacks.

DC Crime Facts documented that USAO increased prosecution rates after being summoned to the Hill for some ""oversight"" in May, so in June, his office only declined to prosecute 55% of arrests, down from a high of 67% of cases being ""no papered."" By July, that no paper rate had increased again.

If OP can buy a SFH, he should work with a realtor and raise these issues re: DMV region. I already raised genuine safety issues renting in bounds for the upper NW schools close to Connecticut and Wisconsin corridors and that applies to rented apartments and rented condos. Look at the MPD crime cards for various buildings, the changes over time are startling.

The realities are what they are, that route to what you call ""exceptional"" schools has a lot of safety risks that never existed before. Buildings in Forest Hills, Cleveland Park, Cathedral Heights and Chevy Chase DC were not being reported by MPD as ""nuisance properties"" even a few years ago. Living in a building with sex offenders and murderers is not what most desire for family living. So that leaves the route to the better schools as SFH w/fewer exceptions. And as families leave DC or higher achieving kids leave DCPS, it's having an impact.

It's all super unfortunate. But trends show no signs of reversing. If we had foreseen any of this, we would have made different choices. OP can't afford to be naive or overly idealistic, it is what it is. I'm sure better days will come for again for both the city and DCPS, but I would not count on it being too soon. DC used to be CHEAP when crime was high, now it is the worst of all worlds with high COL, high rent and high and random crime, including in the daytime and in areas formerly considered safe. After the shooting at Brandywine at 3pm on a Saturday recently, the shooters ran across Forest Hills Playground. The reality has changed really quickly in ways many families never foresaw as even a possibility.

k5jhkfy,17bcxz5,AnonyJustAName,"Areas that OP mentioned have had large crime increases in recent years. Always had some so I would not say new. Daytime and in front of witnesses, with LE nearby is new.

Families are moving out of Petworth, would not recommend to OP with a baby. There is a lot of violence right near that metro and a guy was stabbed to death in the Petworth library at the computers next to little kids.

No papering 2/3 of adult arrests and AGs who think restorative justice is appropriate for homicides committed by juveniles has really emboldened violence. Day/witnesses/cameras don't matter anymore because the chance of serious consequences for the criminal are so low.

As someone who lived in some of the same places as OP, with young kids, I would not live there today. Lanier Heights used to be full of young kids, now people are moving/have moved. After the 3pm Saturday shooting in Forest Hills, I know renters there who have kids who are moving. In that area, over 3,000 PSH vouchers means you may be paying thousands in rent but your taxes may literally move in a released murderer or sex offender next door. DC has no restrictions re: CSA offenders living near kids or schools, Murch has a lot of apartment buildings nearby, you may be shocked at how many SO there are. 

SO are listed on a registry, no way to know about returning citizens who were convicted of very violent offenses. DC only allows landlords a 7 year look back for any crime, regardless of how rent is paid, so if someone did 8 years for homicide or rape or SA of minor, can't be considered, there are no carve outs by offense. Buildings used to require income and credit checks for all, but with voucher not subject to credit checks, etc. So a lot of what DC calls ""returning citizens"" are moving in and in some buildings they become the majority of residents, defacto overpriced ""private public housing."" Not a great environment for a baby if you have other options. 

So, OP, be very wary renting in the Connecticut or Wisconsin corridors which used to be a way for middle class families to access good schools w/o buying houses. Even Frumin has had to admit that crime has greatly increased, including carjackings in the neighborhood by kids living in apartment buildings. The PSA from Cleveland Park up through FH has had the greatest % increase in crime of anywhere in the city in recent years based on MPD crime cards and written about in WP. Google ""nuisance properties Forest Hills"" or ""Washington Post Sedgewick Gardens"" and think about if that is the environment you want to provide for your child, OP.

So some areas do fit your crime is new scenario, PP, others, crime existed but has increased significantly, esp during hours OP and his wife are likely to be out and about, with the baby. It's sad to see so much backsliding re: crime and schools.

I do want to call out that my family's experience with DCPS has been great, even with a kid who has significant needs. Their school provides more service at a higher quality than most private schools we've looked at in the DMV, not to mention other public schools. I know this is unique. 

Under Kaya, DCPS was leading the nation. Bowser's appointments have slowed progress and been milquetoast at best. There are still schools throughout the system, not just in upper NW, that are excellent. This is heavily dependent on school leadership, though, so it can change once one or a few leaders move on.

MC and Fairfax have some very good programs based on what child needs.  I know people who have tried to get DC to pay for Lab since school is not compliant with IEP, typically without success. They rue spending money on lawyers and the lost time and wish they had just moved sooner. So sad that that is often the answer. So painful to witness the gains slip away, eh?

I have only had experience with schools in upper NW, friends have been happy in charters or in elementary schools on the Hill, or at Basis. I don't have direct experience with those but do know it gets harder re; cohort, behavior issues and grade level learning in many schools after elementary esp if child is advanced or needs different help.

We are still here too, trying to hang on for a few more years until youngest out of school with cohort he grew up with. It has shrunk in recent years as kids have gone private or families have moved, people that had always planned to hang in for Deal/Wilson/JR.

I know people in rentals who don't have the ability to move, some who don't have cars and who feel very stuck in worsening situations that used to be fairly ideal for families of modest means, divorced moms, etc. to get kids into Oyster, Janney, Lafayette, Murch, etc. to thread that needle to Deal/JR or Deal/SWW.

In a lot of ways it feels like the compact families had with DCPS has been changed, but that it is true with DC overall. The Fenty years really were a great time to be in the city with young kids, even EoTP, had so many positive trends and a great vibe.  It continued for a while but the trends are really different now. We need to be in DMV for work reasons, I envy you your options.

Re: my older kids, it worked out mostly as we had expected, but if I was just starting a family today, given last few years, and current patterns, I would make other choices, and I say that with kids who are lifers. Crime is a genuine factor. Re: schools you can offer enrichment, get tutors, etc., for safety, we are largely reliant on a very weak CJ system. It increases stress in ways that friends a few miles away just don't experience. 

When I hear of people being carjacked with babies or kids in the car, or the parents who have been attacked on the Hill (that poor baby bashed in the face with a brick as the dad begged) it is so upsetting, and I am grateful my kids are not so little and vulnerable. The putting them in and out of car seats presents and opportunity as does being slowed by stroller. A friend on the Hill has had a hard time keeping a nanny due to violent crime very nearby during the day. When the safety of kids is on the line it is best to be really clear eyed about choices.

Some buildings are majority mentally ill, addicted or formerly incarcerated and the number of sex offenders, including against kids, in rental buildings WoTP has really increased in past few years. Just be fully aware of factors where you land, walk around in daytime and at night, weekdays and weekends. Condo buildings have had a lot of issues with disruptive voucher tenants too. Even if ok if you move in, you have little to no control over possible future renters, so have a plan B in your back pocket.

I helped a friend move out of Petworth from right by the metro. Her neighbor had door kicked in. Hope you find someplace safer soon. I remember when all those little stores were opening up, it's a shame how much things have backslid.

Say your kid goes to Murch and makes a friend, say in 4th or 5th. Say the friend lives at The Brandywine or The Saratoga, both buildings where the recent daytime shooter had ""associations"" per Frumin and MPD. LE is frequently at both buildings, day and night, and there is sometimes visible dealing nearby, MPD reported both as ""nuisance buildings"" meaning they had very frequent calls there, they perceived security issues that were not addressed, etc. What do you say when your kid wants to go over for a playdate or sleepover? Do you let them walk over alone after school? At that age, if safety/crime was not an issue, would be fine. Do you let them carry a phone with them that they could be mugged for? Forget 20 years ago, 10 years ago would have been FINE. Now, lots more to weigh up than in most burb schools. 

Lots more violent crime on metro during peak fare hours, bus and trains. It's changed the ages people let kids free roam in many families. I recently saw someone smoking crack in a redline train during rush hour. People are often having mental health episodes. My older kids had more freedom, they did not have to navigate this kind of thing even 6 years ago.

 ""Yes, rape is never ok. Its never ok for a man to violate a woman in that way. That said, you need to be smart. Don't dress provocatively, while galavanting around in a dangerous area, alone, at night. While its NEVER ok to blame the victim, its also on the person to engage in a little bit of situational awareness. Bad people are gonna exist, and they're gonna do what they do. So its on you to protect yourself.""

I can only think to the people of Myannmar; had democratic elections, elected Aung San Suu Kyi to a position of power. Then you know what happened? Thugs with guns (i.e. power) took over the country in a coup d'etat, killed hundreds of their people, imprisoned Suu Kyi, and guess what? They're still in power.

People in America, at least young people, have never had their way of life threatened before. We've been in a bubble. We don't know what real violence looks like. So they try to ""appeal to the better nature"" of these thugs, not realizing that they might as well be trying to preach virtue to a tardigrade... Can't appeal to self-actualization if your physiological and safety/security needs aren't being met.

You know, its funny; people think that non-violence is ALWAYS the answer. In ALL cases. I'll leave you with 2 quotes:

""I  WOULD risk violence a thousand times rather than risk the emasculation of a whole race. ""

"" I do believe that, where there is only a choice between cowardice and violence, I would advise violence... I would rather have India resort to arms in order to defend her honour than that she should, in a cowardly manner, become or remain a helpless witness to her own dishonor.

But I believe that nonviolence is infinitely superior to violence, forgiveness is more manly than punishment. Forgiveness adorns a soldier...But abstinence is forgiveness only when there is the power to punish; it is meaningless when it pretends to proceed from a helpless creature....

But I do not believe India to be helpless....I do not believe myself to be a helpless creature....Strength does not come from physical capacity. It comes from an indomitable will.

We do want to drive out the beast in the man, but we do not want on that account to emasculate him. And in the process of finding his own status, the beast in him is bound now and again to put up his ugly appearance.

The world is not entirely governed by logic. Life itself involves some kind of violence and we have to choose the path of least violence.""

This is all not accurate. And while we should complain about DC, NY, NJ, Cali laws, but we should also not exaggerate or incorrectly state them and discourage prospective new gun owners or carry permit holders.

DC allows handgun roster is on any one of: Mass (and the broader of Mass's two rosters), **Maryland**, or Cali list. 

\- Cali is moot since it is shortest roster. 

\-Mass list is quite broad, all the major brand pistols are on it. and you do not need to comply with Mass Attorney General extra conditions to the roster which requires safeties, cartridge indicators, mag release no fire etc),  but rather the much bigger basic Mass roster  which is a safety test (drops/ can it hit the side of a barn, decent quality materials and manufacture, does it explode when fired) .

\-Like Mass, Maryland's roster is a safety test and almost all guns are on it. Drop-fire, and quality inspection. 

So unless you are trying to register a very rare pistol you are ok. and anyway DC residents can and have submitted very rare pistols to Maryland state PD and gotten them added to roster making them legal in DC.

DC does have standalone constraints on affixing a threaded barrel to a pistol (allowed last time I checked in Md) and more importantly an outright felony for possession of any >10 round magazine, even if you have no pistol for it.

 On FFLS There are at least two FFLS that service DC. almost everyone buys on line and has it shipped to FFL which is easy and quick. DC is a small town of 600k people and any bottle necks on gun purchase are not at FFL level. One drawback is given No. Virginia FFL costs run about $45, you do pay an $80 premium given the DC FFLs charge \~$125. But that is a one time elevated cost of that $80",3,2023,10,1,1,0

That said, my argument is this: While there isn't a shortage of cops (and therefore ""police guns"") in DC, their response time makes it such that they might as well not be around. What good is a squad of cops with guns if they show up 30 minutes after the thug has beat you up, shot your dog, stole your car, and has been gone for 20 minutes? Same idea with people that live in rural areas; if there's a home invasion, the nearest cop could be an hour away.

So in a scenario like the aforementioned ones, what is the solution to the person on the receiving end of crime? They can be a victim, at the mercy of whatever the thug wants to do, or they can give themselves some agency, and the option to fight back. I prefer to fight back than to be a victim.

If they have a stable life where they attend school / work they're probably not the ones in the worst spot.

We should improve housing affordability not by broken and corrupt affordable housing policies, but by lessening building restrictions and perhaps outright funding high density low cost housing.

Most of the crime is committed by children. We should set up boarding schools for them and when they're caught committing a crime, remove them from the toxic communities they're in and send them to the boarding schools. Parents should be able to voluntarily send their kids as well if they wish to.

We should make the penalties for recruiting or encouraging children to commit crimes incredibly severe and prosecute the TikTok influencers encouraging them under RICO crimes, as well as local gangs.

We should empower police to pursue investigations and crimes even if flawed. We can mandate body camera for all of them.

We should recognize the failure of the police and we should allow DC citizens to get licenses to carry guns if they pass extensive background checks and training.

Every gun recovered gets tracked back to whoever had it last and if they didn't report it lost or stolen they go automatically get put on the prosecution as an accessory to the crime.  If they legitimately lost the gun or it was stolen then the person who committed the crime gets an automatic 10 years additional prison time unless they give up the person they got the gun from.  And if the last registered owner did report guns lost or stolen more than once they lose their right to own a gun because they are obviously not responsible gun owners.

k6vx3dz,17ikoa1,ClayTart,"He was making deranged threats which should've caught the attention of the 70 billion dollar a year DOJ. Here's the scenario of what most likely went down: he was a armed forces personell. Owned guns. Makes a lot of threats. Is involuntarily committed. Released. Mass shooting ensues. The DOJ had like 3 opportunities before the mass shooting to knock this guy out for like idk a thousand bucks? (Whatever the cost of a few lawyers is) They still failed.

And ""Loose patchwork of state and local laws?""

Every state has involuntary commitment. Like it's very much an established procedure in America since the 70s. Just like the process of obtaining an arrest or search warrant. Just because civil commitment is badly enforced due to negligent reporting does not mean gun owners are to blame because you hate guns and you think everything is the gun owners fault. 

As for the gun laws in Chicago and Indiana, those things have nothing to do with what happened here. ROFL. You're trying to turn this into a winning argument for the antigunners and it isn't working. The shit happening in chicago is a mix of poverty, soft on crime laws, and culture. A bunch of gangsters are bringing guns into chicago from indiana. OK so wtf is Indiana supposed to do. Are they gang banging in Indiana or chicago? Obviously chicago. So how about better surveillance and prosecutions of gangsters in chicago? The cops don't know where the gangsters are or something? Hint: they do but they defended the police SMH. Even if Indiana could intercept the gangsters while they're in the middle of purchasing guns, do you honestly think that's the best way to go about it? Dude. Take a look at Singapore. Surrounded by drug infested regions. They give the drug dealers the death penalty and nobody dares bring drugs to singapore. Maybe they're onto something? It has nothing to do with guns. If chicago and Indiana were basically the same exact thing and the only thing different about them is that chicago were more antigun and has a huge crime problem, that would validate the pro gun arguments even more LMFAO. And if youre suggesting that Indiana adopt more anti gun laws to make Chicago's surrounding area more hostile to guns, that is begging the question to the max. You're forcing me to choose between 1) Being soft on crime and anti gun or 2) Being soft on crime and pro gun. You then get angry when I say no to option 1. You pretend i support option 2 when I actually think both choices absolutely suck ass. I'm saying you need to choose between 1) Being tough on crime and pro gun, 2) Being soft on crime and pro gun, 3) Being tough on crime and anti gun, or 4) Being soft on crime and anti gun. We should choose option 1 everywhere and you think we should choose option 4 everywhere.

See where I'm going with this? We SHOULD be tough on crime and enforce civil commitment laws, prohibited posessor laws, very diligently. But your side got it backwards. Being tough on law abiding gun owners and soft on crime. Thanks for nothing",2,2023,10,1,1,"1, 3"

The only valid reason (and, I think, the historic reason) to regulate rifles based on appearance is symbolism. The problem, however, is that attacking symbolism has a poor track record. The federal AWB didn’t actually reduce the number of shootings or the number of gun deaths; it merely reduced the number of shootings _committed with banned weapons_ while the number of shootings committed with other weapons went up. In fact, there’s a very good argument that the obsession with banning guns based on appearance is precisely why mass shooters select those particular guns more often now (before the AWB, shootings with semiautomatic rifles were virtually nonexistent).",2,2023,10,1,1,0

What Indiana is supposed to do is require background checks every time someone buys or transfers a gun, eliminating the loophole for private sales, and to raise a red flag if the same guy keeps showing up every two weeks to buy a dozen 9mms.  But there's no mandatory universal background checks and there's no searchable database of gun transactions that can help identify straw buyers.  What all jurisdictions need to also do is to have mental health screenings.

And it does have to do with what happens here because criminals will find the weak link.  When it's easier to get guns in VA than it is in DC then criminals go to VA to get their guns.  We have a loose, dysfunctional patchwork of gun laws that isn't working..",2,2023,10,1,1,"1, 5"

k6zgbyf,17j7mvb,Maximus560,"The major issue here apart from what you have said is two-fold: 

1. Prosecutors: One quick solution that we can do in the short term with immediate impact is to get the prosecutors do their job. The main issue is that prosecutors are federal in DC, so local government has no sway over how they choose to prosecute cases. The federal prosecutors are focused on other things at the federal level, not local cases for the most part. If cases aren't being prosecuted, then cops have no incentive to arrest people especially for minor crimes. Minor crimes that aren't prosecuted or enforced often leads to major crimes later, since criminals aren't held accountable and know they won't be held accountable. Change the prosecutors to be accountable to local government and things will change quickly IMO. Cops and the mayor can't do shit if prosecutors are letting criminals free the same day they're arrested. 
2. Lack of Investment: One longer range or wider issue is that DC doesn't invest enough in  schools, services, homelessness, drugs, jobs, etc which are often the root causes of crime. This solution would take 5-15+ years just to see fruit so there isn't much point for politicians to do anything or care about these things, but they are very impactful. If we had better social service programs, more affordable housing, a better jobs pipeline, better schools, and better diversion programs, then we can easily cut crime down significantly. For example - most of the crime that we see at Starburst has to do with drugs. Cracking down on drugs isn't going to solve the root causes of these issues - we need to invest in housing, mental health support, rehabilitation programs, etc. These programs will take a while, and are expensive, so there's very little appetite on the part of voters and politicians to even think about tackling these issues.",11,2023,10,1,1,"1,4"

\- and the lack of facilities for dealing with people whether it's turning juvies around or prisoners, which for example gave us the recent carjacking where someone just got killed in the resulting crash and one of the dumb kids involved was out with a gps ankle bracelet

The solutions are long term: better education (which means substantially more pay for teachers as a start), more opportunities for young people to develop marketable skills that lets them see a future that doesn’t include violence, and a sea change in the way we look at each other—more us, less me.

k6zks4z,17j7mvb,lawblawg,"While any solution would need to be comprehensive and multifaceted, I can point to a few contributing causes.

MPD requires a college degree for most officer applicants, something that is fairly uncommon among law enforcement agencies nationwide. While I certainly understand the purpose of this requirement and one might presume that it would raise the calibre of applicants, it seems to have done the opposite. Being an MPD officer pays reasonably well and has great benefits, but it is an awful job with a lot of unpleasant and demanding elements, and everyone is going to hate you. As a result, most of the people with college degrees who apply nowadays are the ones who can't really do anything else with their degree or don't fit in any other industry. MPD is scraping the bottom of the barrel when it comes to applicants, and it's just getting worse and worse. Paradoxically, we would end up with BETTER applicants (and thus better officers) if we got rid of the college degree requirement, because we'd end up getting the best of the non-degree-holders applying instead of the worst of the degree-holders.

Speaking of MPD, their job is basically impossible. DC is a uniquely complex city and MPD is tasked with doing way too much. On top of the usual social-work-level nonsense that cities often assign to cops (usually leading to more violent escalations of otherwise-nonviolent situations), MPD also has a lot of duties related to the federal enclave and has to assist all of the other various law enforcement agencies but is always subordinated to their authority. Most cities have a separate sheriff department to handle things like service of process, but here it's all on MPD. Since there's no way to do the whole job, they do it more and more poorly. There needs to be a way to narrow MPD's duties as far as possible so that the officers who actually care have an actual chance of succeeding. MPD should have fewer responsibilities related to the federal government and fewer responsibilities related to non-crime-fighting activities. We don't need uniformed officers going around taking non-time-critical reports. I remember earlier this summer that my girlfriend got hit in the head by a random individual who was going door to door in Brookland stores throwing objects at people, and we reported it, and officers showed up that night to take the report and write down what we said in a little notebook and refer it to a detective. Convenient for us, sure -- but it's not like they were going to catch the person right then, so why isn't there a less time-consuming way to take crime reports?

Guns are a big part of the problem as well. Based on what I've been able to determine from crime statistics, there is a pretty large contingent of people in DC who are illegally carrying guns not because they intend to commit crime, but because they feel unsafe and feel a need to protect themselves. Those unregistered, untraceable guns are subsequently very likely to end up in the hands of criminals. We should make it possible for individuals without criminal records to [lawfully register firearms they already possess](https://www.reddit.com/r/DCGuns/comments/17cr76w/registration_amnesty_proposal/) so that they can actually be held accountable moving forward.

The other stuff is big, system-wide changes. We can keep petitioning for statehood, though I doubt we'll ever get it. We could do a public referendum to try and require different prosecutorial practices. We could make it clear that we want an attorney general who will handle juvenile crime differently, and show up in primaries.

It is now proven that the vast majority of crime committed by an extremely tiny cohort of repeat/career predatory criminals. 

in fact in DC, 200 known people, not random, but known persons who comprise 0.03% of DC population, will commit the large majority of shooting and murder in DC.

kan031i,182iq12,Gaijin_Monster,"Yes, it's a consipiracy where everyone is out to get you.  Since you were 8 years old, you and 41 other people in your local area were specifically chosen by the secret society to be held down.   You've been personally tracked since that point in your whole life.  

All the decisions you made in your life were not actually your choice -- you were under the mind control of the secret headquarters control room located under the wonder bread and saltine cracker headquarters.  All those times where you though everyone around you had to earn their way with education and accomplishments -- it was all an illusion.  They got a free pass and it was just a ruse to hold you back and make you not realize you were part of the secret group that was being held back.  Every time you outperformed the people around you, a secret task force went to your school and workplace in the middle of the night -- using fast ropes, wearing all black -- and modified your grades and progress reviews.  Those things you think are traffic lights?  It's just an illusion specifically designed to slow you and you alone.  All the other cars that stop at them are just holograms so you don't realize you're being targeted.  The secret society involuntarily makes some people commit crime uncontrollably. 

They're watching right now.  Better put on a tin foil hat to make sure they can't read your brain waves. Even better go out and take out a 5G cell tower, because that's the new generation of control device.  Also stay away from the rennovated US Capitol Building Dome.  That statue called ""Freedom"" at the top of the dome is just a long waveform antenna that amplifies all the mind control signals.  It's why the only thing in DC taller than the dome in DC is the Washington Monument -- the monument is a tuner for the antenna on the dome.  I hope you didn't get a COVID vaccine because that's a micro electro-biological device that acts a receiver from the control frequencies that statue.  If you go to a quiet and dark room and close your eyes you can hear the faintest ultra high frequency pitched beep it puts out every 245 seconds... that is the connection tone and that's how you know they got you.  The man is keeping you down.. you specifically.  If they have you, be cautious, because the next thing you know you'll be subconciously looting a CVS, or committing a carjacking.  You'll wake up the next day ... maybe in jail... and have no idea what happened.",2,2023,11,1,1,0

I think Virginia has more wealthy areas in large part because the state is more business friendly and has invested more in infrastructure (look at 495 in Maryland vs Virginia).

DC has a crime problem and it isn’t the police’s fault. Police here are numerous and respond quickly. They find perps and stolen cars almost always.

ks8bzx3,1b0anrh,Additional-Mood-2780,"Navy Yard was home to many residents and saw one of DC’s most violent gentrification periods with some crazy number of residence being displace. The area was home to many abandoned 2nd & 3rd industrial era buildings but also many people as well. 

So areas in the district that are not of any purpose anymore and house no residence are seeing dramatic changes. But this does not mean this is where “most” of the generation is taking place because it is not at all. The entire North side of the city is almost completely gentrified, with the cities black residents going from 70% to less than 46% over a span on 30 years. 

And I did not say this is the root cause, I specifically said “this isn’t the only cause…” But like I said it is a major one that is overlooked by the ignorance of the ENTIRE City, not just Bowser and other politicians. 

And how do I know it’s major cause of what’s happening? I explain this in my original comment from what I saw going to school in towns by the border and there is plenty of research/data on the issue. 

Wow that ending statement was insane, kicking these already struggling residents out of a CITY (the thing people move to for work and opportunities) without any assistance into the same area will not “change their life for the better” at all. Again like how I explained, the conditions and crime of the city have major roots to the displacement of poverty into a single area. Instead of providing the adequate resources to these areas, the city instead invests more time and money into other parts of the city.

‘Sketchiness’ is subjective and unscientific so of course it is something people would disagree about. Again if you want to be pedantic, “an increase in sketchiness” is different from “getting sketchy”

Overall traffic of people in the area was up YoY over the same period too so it is natural for absolute crime stats to be up (I.e. it would be one mitigating factor when it comes to perceived sketchiness)

Looking at crimecards.dc.gov, there was a CY22-23 YoY increase in # of crimes of 109 incidents in PSA 206.

> We want to continue to be able to serve the community, but we can’t do so at the level of significant loss or risk to our associates that we have today, said Giant President Ira Kress.

> At this particular store, it’s actually worse, not better,” Kress said of the shrink. “And we’ve invested a significant amount of money here, even more security here than any other store.

> “We have no other choice,” Diane Hicks, senior vice president of operations, said Thursday during a walk-through with officials from the D.C. mayor’s office, the city’s police and fire departments, and the Chamber of Commerce. She added that other nearby stores have locked up all products in those aisles or removed them altogether. “I’ve been leaving it out for our customers, and unfortunately it just forces all the crime to come to us.""

> Some D.C. Council members have expressed concern that Giant might shut down a store that serves a ward of more than 85,000 people. Not only is a supermarket like Giant an important part of the community, it also is a lifeline for a community with limited access to quality food.

> Theft and violence is an issue in the area around the store, said Lindsey Appiah, deputy mayor for public safety and justice, who was among the officials touring the store on Thursday. But having access to a grocery store is “important for public health purposes,” so her office plans to work with Giant to find solutions.

It's literally so bad that the deputy mayor has to be involved, because both Giant and the City think the store is concerned they're going to have to pack up and leave.  Thankfully it's a big company like Giant, so they can hold on a little longer.  Most stores could not do this.  That said, the people who do pay now have to pay higher costs due to the criminals stealing from the store.

Military probably gets a much steadier flow of volunteer forces while also giving valuable skills, lessons, and confidence to young folk who go through a year of military service. 

And now that I think about it, maybe do both? You can pick one or the other, why not? 

Though I’m not oblivious to the fact that such an act would not be very popular and a non-military service may be more amicable (though probably still unpopular even if less so), most of these ideas at least for now are far and away.

All countries have a right to draft their citizens and will do so if they deem it necessary for the survival of a nation.

As for a choice between jail or military service isn’t exactly a good solution. The army, navy and marines are voluntary and do not to sign criminals to contracts. And you especially certainly wouldn’t want them on warships in a ready-to-strike naval force. Shore duty sure, but even then I don’t imagine the navy wanting that either.

The military service I suggested ought to be provided would be a more expeditious series of military, team, and skills training, a focus on the duties and responsibilities of the military and civilians, with learning and specialization opportunities all within the span of 1 year. No contracts required. It’s like ROTC. 

Something kind of like what S.K. or Israel has, but with a lighter focus on combat and more on discipline, health, life skills and esteem building. It’d essentially be its own proto-branch.

I think this is very doable but i don't see people talking about it the right way. We need to be SCIENTIFIC and accountable. Enforcement is critical but up river prevention even more so.

Would love your thoughts:

Deputy Mayor for Public Safety +
Criminal Justice Coordinating Council

Let's get serious about solving these issues

Thank you for hosting this meeting.

My name is James Salt and I’m a resident of Ward 4. A man was murdered in front of my children and me this past March at the Petworth library.

This traumatic event motivates me to invest energy in pursuing community safety.

Here are my thoughts. I’d particularly like a response from Ms. Appiah and then anyone else.

Crime needs an immediate response for the sake of accountability. Given this dynamic though, we tend to be more reactive and less proactive.

In other words, 75% of what we discuss should be up-river solutions - particularly if we are serious about wanting different outcomes.

The 25% is also essential and needs to be addressed, but we shouldn’t allow the acute issues to limit our vision of the larger, more systemic forces producing the problem.

That said, here are my thoughts inspired by a friend and fellow Petworth resident Tara McGuiness (https://www.newamerica.org/our-people/tara-mcguinness/)

We should be applying the scientific method in solving these problems.

We need committed leaders willing to take ownership of the issue and invest personal accountability. They must be willing to own failure. Failure is critical to improving.

Pilot solutions. Don’t approach the problem with an assumption of confidence that your solution will work. Demonstrate it and test it. Avoid confirmation bias and be open to changing strategies.  

Be careful with large solutions that are difficult to modify. Typically these solutions require political capital to start and are therefore difficult to change.  

Be careful with 101 solutions. How are you testing the unique contribution of each treatment?
 
Data feedback loop. As part of accountability, you need honest data if you are truly tracking the effectiveness of a proposed solution 

Good data —-> test treatment  —-> review data changes —-> repeat. But you need to be dialed into whether you are actually moving the needle or not.

As a starting point, I’d begin with a retrospective study of crime data. Who are victims and perpetrators of crime, where do they live? Where did they go to school? What were the perpetrators’ motives for the crime? (Policy Recommendation: As part of the terms of incarceration, incentivize perpetrators participation with a retrospective crime reduction study using increased privileges or increased points towards good behavior.)  It’s also helpful to allow time to pass before collecting this information from victims, victims family and perpetrators. 

What government or community relationships existed that could have been vectors for engagement in their lives? Given the general attributes of these victims and perpetrators, what ‘continuum of care’ or ‘matrix of services’ can we prospectively deploy to interact with the affected demographic?  How could a consortium of partnered agencies and community interests: DCPS, DPR, MPD, Department of Health, DC Witness, faith communities etc. collaborate in touching the lives that need to be touched?

Moving forward: I haven’t heard DC leaders talking like this and I’m wondering if the Mayor's office-and others- are having this conversation. Are these conversations happening and who’s responsible for leading and reporting out on it? If not, is there interest getting it started right now?

Is the Criminal Justice Coordinating Council effective? Shouldn’t it be doing this?  Can its scope extend beyond the silo of criminal safety and expand into more holistic treatments that already exist?",6,2024,1,1,1,"1, 3"
kjvbl2k,1ac1l8o,qcassidyy,"Move to another neighborhood. It sounds like these safety concerns are dominating your life. There are neighborhoods in DC — and yes, ones outside Georgetown and other highly sanitized/rich zip codes — that are calmer. I’ve lived in several middle class DC neighborhoods for 12 years and never experienced any of the things you describe, or at least nowhere near to the scale you’ve described them at. 

Another action you can take is mentoring a young person through organizations like DC Dream Center. It may just feel like a drop in the bucket, but in the end, you’re probably moving the needle in more of a positive direction than you’d be by emailing your council member every few weeks. The problems we’re dealing with, as suggested by another comment in this thread, penetrate far deeper than policy or laws. They are cultural, and they require deep relationships and positive role models to counteract.

Defining Deviance Down by Moynihan and then analyze social justice decriminalization. Bratton's second autobiography. The social urbanism approach in Medellin. Fixing broken windows--the only place it's really been applied was the New York subway.  CPTED. Center for Problem Oriented Policing. I guess Sharkey.

Then the issues are charging. Sentencing. (Ever compare sentencing between DC and Montgomery County?) Treating violent youth crimes seriously. Maybe pretrial evaluation needs to be reevaluated too. A bit more remand. Better pre trial monitoring. Use of police time. Crime suppression versus reaction. Better investigation capability. Investing in programs for ""returning citizens.""

Eg if USAO isn't going to charge and prosecute, how will more federal resources help?

Access to guns is tough nut to crack. The NRA and Supreme Court aren't our friends. Lots come from Virginia.

khzfnds,196sio2,MakeMoneyNotWar,"For income tax that’s not true at all. Due to MCs much flatter tax structure, the first $100,000 is taxed at about 7.95% combined state and county. State is 4.75% from $3,000 to $100,000 in income. Theres brackets before 7.95% but it’s $3000 (so basically immaterial). MC is another flat 3.2%. 

So if your AGI is 100,000 you pay 1000x5.2% + 1000x6.2% + 1000x7.2% + 97,000x7.95% = $7,897 in MD state and local tax. For DC, it’s 10,000x4% + 30000x6% + 20000x6.5%. + 40000x8.5% = $6,900. 

You can do the math yourself, but at $250,000 in income, you would pay $19,650 in DC and $20,812 in MD. The 7.95% in MD on the first $97,000 in income  is KILLER.",7,2024,1,1,1,0

A few more facts, while I’m here:  
- I’m not sure what has changed in your life from years ago when your cart was full, but I promise you that budgeting on food stamps is not some sort of lobsters-glory-time. Look up some facts.  
- DC’s history - its very structure as a city and not a state - is strongly intertwined with racial discrimination. It’s arguably part of the fabric of DC as much as many, many other places in this country: let’s not pretend otherwise.  
- Joe the Plumber wasn’t from DC (in fact, I think the whole made up persona was supposed to be very anti-DC) and critical race theory (CRT) is literally about understanding how racial bias/hate happens, not hate itself. Do better.

As someone else who doesn't drive and has lived in DC and New York for most of her adult life, I'd gently encourage you to recalibrate your expectations if you want to find somewhere you love. I'm surprised that, as a DMV native, you expect to have three grocery stores in your vicinity, including one ethnic one, as that's pretty ambitious for most places! I've usually had to make do with a small grocery store that's walking distance and metro adventures/online shopping for the others. And yes, there are fewer shopping areas in DC now and COVID did a number on small businesses, so when I want to shop, I go online or take the metro to Bethesda, Pentagon City, Pike & Rose, or Tysons. 

Finally, all reviews for apartment buildings should be taken with some skepticism. Some people only submit a review if something bad happens (and on the other side, some buildings pay tenants to write rave reviews). So a lot of places will be just fine, but nobody is choosing to share that info.

It's entirely possible to have a reasonable moderation policy: Allow comments in the first article that gets posted, but delete the other articles to prevent the same topic posted a dozen times over. The sports subreddits do this: When Ohtani eventually signs a free agency deal, the discussion will appear in one mega-thread rather than being posted in a dozen different threads.

This subreddit's approach is to not delete anything, which is mostly fine albeit annoying seeing the same thing over and over again.

kizoldv,19c8vfa,TuckerANC1B09,"Hi, I serve as an elected member of ANC 1B. Thank you in advance for offering to put this list together. Many of these meetings are still being held virtually or hybrid, so it can be relatively easy to attend.

For ANC 1B, our Commission meetings are generally held the first Thursday of each month, unless that date is a holiday. They are held via Zoom only unless otherwise noted. You can see all of our meetings and how to join them [on the ANC 1B website](https://www.anc1b.org).

Also, to see which ANC area you live in, I like [this unofficial website](https://openanc.org).

Some unsolicited advice: the more specific you can be with your concern, the more likely it is that your ANC can help get it addressed.

I've had luck connecting police with neighbors over complaints like ""I am worried about this repeated behavior in this alley"" and getting police walkthroughs in those areas. (I've done the same for getting the Department of Health out for ""I am worried about the rats in this particular area"" and getting the Department of Public Works out for ""I am worried about the trash in this particular area."")

However, when the problem is large scale, ANCs are not usually an effective avenue of dealing with the issue. ""I'm worried that a lot of people in DC have illegal guns"" is a very legitimate concern, but as a member of an ANC, there's really not much I can do about that. I don't even know how to begin approaching that problem, even though it's clearly more important than the one alleyway near me. Not to be to glib about it, but ""Do something about crime"" is not feedback that I or any other member of an ANC can act on - even though the sentiment is totally justified.

And one more bit of unsolicited advice: These meetings can be very long and very boring. Most of what is on the agenda will not be related to crime. Please be prepared to exercise patience, and keep an eye on the agenda so you'll know when the topics you care about are due up for discussion.

Also, please note that the various **Metropolitan Police Department districts usually have Citizens Advisory Councils (CACs)**. The 3rd District CAC (3DCAC) works with MPD's 3rd District, which includes U Street, Adams Morgan, Columbia Heights, and more. I've found those meetings useful for me to understand the various ways our public safety structures are breaking down. At the meetings I've been to, there are representatives from most of the various offices that deal with crime and public safety, including the USAO, the Attorney General, and various executive offices, plus the Ward Council Member's staff (or, pretty frequently, the Ward Council Member herself) and occasionally people from the Mayor's Office on Constituent Relations and Services. They all have different perspectives and getting them all in a room together makes it harder for them to pass the buck.

The 3DCAC meets on the final Thursday of each month (final Wednesday for Spanish-language meeting). You can read more about them [here](https://www.3dcac.org).",7,2024,1,1,1,"1, 5"

Personally I think Brookland and Bloomingdale are very safe. Brookland is more family centric, someone mentioned it is more ""suburban."" I'd agree with that. It has a homey vibe. 

Parking can be a real pain in D.C. especially, as you've described, needing parking in the late evening hours. If that is important to you, then I would say lean towards Brookland just because there's more space and less overall traffic/population in the area given a lot of the single family homes. Bloomingdale and Eckington are pretty hard to find parking in those hours, in my opinion. Probably not ""impossible"" but lots of driving around unless you happen to find a spot by chance.",6,2024,3,1,1,"1,8"

Do you really consider that “complaining” when it’s a pretty commonly held feeling among DC residents? I’m not the only person that feels this way.  

I said there needs to be accountability that’s somewhere between a minor slap on the wrist and serious jail time. No, long term prison sentences are not the answer and it’s empirically obvious that this strategy only increases recidivism. But short term sentences do seem to have some impact, especially among people who aren’t serious criminals. Arresting people is the start but that can’t be the only part of the solution. It has zero impact on a person to get booked and released again without time to think on their crime.

Back to my original point, which you seem intent on ignoring, I think the answer to a lot of these issues with teens is *deterrence*, aka making risky behavior and criminal activity as unattractive as possible.

iml1m65,x2b2l6,Delski28,"Hahahaha. This is fucking hilarious and it’s obvious to me that you didn’t read what u/DeliMcPickles said nor do you understand the current plague that is the USAO and OAG. 

Juveniles aren’t getting charged with crimes and they know it, if they are charged they’re let off with a slap on the wrist. It’s why you see anytime a juvenile or anyone for any matter is locked up for a carjacking or homicide they’ve been charged for a litany of felonies before hand. 

DC MPD, MCPD, PGPD and other departments release videos of any serious uses of force, but do you know what serious use of force is considered? The mean definition between the three is any use of force that results in a broken bone, fracture, unconsciousness, firearms, canine bites, strikes other than hand strikes to the head, and the list goes on. If i were to go tackle a fleeting robbery suspect, wherein the average person runs at 8mph, that means they’re slamming into the ground face first at 8mph if not faster after being hit. That simple shit could easily turn into a serious use of force from the impact and the same could be said for a million different uses of force. Even a taser, a tool designed to limit the use of force full stop can turn into a serious use of force. In Atlanta a officer was chasing a fleeing suspect for a misdemeanor offense and tasked him wherein the man fell and broke his neck thus leaving him paralyzed. A jury just awarded him $100m for a justified use of force. 

Now imagine all of that above, you have a juvenile fleeing from you from a stolen car or a robbery and you use force on them which results in a serious injury from what would be a low level use of force and the OAG declines to prosecute the juvenile? It doesn’t matter now because your name is released to the public with your address being readily accessible online, your work place, and now you’re also being sued civilly where even if it’s bullshit you’re now waiting six months for a verdict where the government will most likely settle because it’s cheaper than fighting it.

So now your information is released publicly, you have a “justified” use of force on a juvenile who wasn’t charged for a crime, the public knows you’re being sued too because that’s publicly available and they won’t care if it was settled or the reason for it, you’re guilty in their eyes for an “unjustified” use of force because the juvenile wasn’t charged and it cost the taxpayers money. 

So to tackle a juvenile fleeing from a stolen car or a robbery that at most would spend 12-24 hours in jail and already has a three page rap sheet, you risked your career, your retirement, your family’s safety and your own just for a juvenile to be charged for the fifth time in a year a felony?

It’s not fucking worth it and it’s easy to sit there and say everything you have without looking at it from an officers perspective or ever even going on a ride along.

>A good portion of the people I’ve seen who work in those low paying sectors aren’t actually “scraping by” — they’re middle/upper middle class suburban kids who are able to work in low paying jobs because their living expenses are subsidized by family.

In my experience, this usually means that they don't have college loans, or at best their rent is subsidized. But you're mistaking cause and effect. You seem to snub your nose at the idea of working for a ""greater good"" what used to be known as ""public service"". 

We live in Washington, DC. Many of the jobs here fall under that rubric, so by definition at any time there will be a large number of people working in those jobs, and they have to live somewhere. Even if someone's lifestyle is subsidized, that doesn't mean that they can suddenly afford a really nice rent. They're still making decisions based upon a limited supply of income, and many of them seek out lower rents where they can either have money for discretionary spending or can save. 

There's a general snobbishness or othering towards millennials/Zoomers that I'm sure you're aware of. The notion that ""avacado toast"" is some sort of luxury item. The idea that we're ""killing"" industries. The idea that living together in group housing or not buying cars is a generational quirk. in fact, we're the first generation[s] in decades to be making less than our parents, and generation-wide, that drives a lot of the decision-making.

You may not be aware of it, but it seems that you have internalized many of these same stereotypes and condescension. The nation is in a housing crisis and the region is one of the most expensive, and it's rife with low-paying jobs that people want to fill for one reason or another. Because people take these jobs, they then have to find savings elsewhere, hence the rise of group houses in gentrifying neighborhoods--they're willing to tolerate more dangerous areas in part because they don't have a ton of choice. Commuting itself is also expensive--$20 every day just to spend an hour and a half to two hours on the Metro adds up. I've done it myself, living in a group house and commuting in from near Bethesda, and it sucked.

Your whole attitude comes across to me as someone who starts from a positions of disliking, or at least feeling morally superior to, your peers, and then judging them for life choices that, by definition, you will run across all the time in DC.

Humans are really good at pointing out issues. Empirically, we see that children walking around wearing balaclavas is anti-social behavior. Out of concern, we argue that we need laws to outlaw face coverings in summer. Great! However, does that law get to the behavior of *why* that person wore the face mask in the first place? NO. 

If socio-economic factors - think education level, family support, income, etc. - have a casual connection with crime, it would behoove us to work on changing those socio-economic factors. We can walk and chew gum, at the same time, but I want to be clear that *punishment* is a deterrent not panacea.

Right now the biggest pro-police member of the Council is probably Ward 7 Councilmember and D.C. native Vince Gray.

Even Ward 8 Councilmember Trayon White, who's often critical of police, voted against the criminal code reform because it had more lenient sentences and came out in support of SRO's when most of the Council was still against them.

You get the sense that transplants live in a sort of progressive bubble where they rarely interact with locals (hence the surprise they give you when you tell them they're a local), get told by activists types that ""real locals"" don't care about crime and that only a concern new arrivals have, and then they uncritically assume this to be true without actually talking to locals themselves (or outside of a handful of activist type locals).",68,2023,5,2,1,"1, 5"

But the bottom line is that the Council can't legislate competence. The Mayor is responsible for enforcement and implementation of city laws and programs.  And despite her ""tough on crime"" persona, she actually hasn't done a good job of running the city.  She's in charge of a 911 system that doesn't work. She's in charge of MPD, which doesn't follow basic staffing distribution and has major, systemic problems with training and recruitment. She's in charge of DC's Crime Labs, which lost their accreditation.  She's in charge of the violence interruption programs, only one of which is working (the smaller one, run by OAG) not the larger one run under her administration. She's let the truancy office fail. It goes on and on. 

The truth is she inherited a city on the upswing and that covered up the fact that she's not a very good executive, but now that we're facing real, serious and difficult problems, she's showing herself not up to the task.

Let’s also stop beating around the bush when talking about crime in DC as if it’s not associated with race. When anyone talks about NE/SE, violent crime, “youths” etc we know what they’re talking about. The inability of folks here to discuss race frankly is not conducive to solving any problems.

Social programs are key but I really don’t know the best approach. Kids grow up in these environments thinking it’s the only way to live. It’s a crab bucket. It’s not much different from folks in a small town being seen as uppity/outcast when they want to do better for themselves.

Investment in infrastructure, housing, recreation and eduction. Investment in jobs, real jobs, for those who can get them. And to be serious? Investment in women. Create economic opportunities so that women don’t need men to survive. So that women (and girls) know that there is something waiting for them at the end of their teenage years to work for. Invest in childcare, so women can educate themselves and work. Invest in schools, really invest in schools, make them physical temples, so that women want to send their children. Invest in sex eduction and birth control (and yea, access to abortion on demand) so that women can choose when to have children, and getting laid after a party at 16 doesn’t set you back financially for life. Invest in physical rehabilitation centers so an injury doesn’t condemn you to poverty. Invest in senior care, so that people can have a dignified old age without being a financial and physical burden in their children, which falls overwhelmingly on women. Invest in substance rehab facilities and programs so people who fall can get help and move forward. Invest in environmental remediation so that children aren’t exposed to toxins that limit them for life (seen the asthma numbers? The lead exposure numbers?) invest in businesses, so people can work and shop in their own neighborhoods. Invest in housing, and in people owning housing, so people have decent places to live, and something to aspire to. As well as someplace that will catch them if they need it. Oh, and mental health. Invest in mental health, beyond pills, cause there’s trauma to deal with. 

Give women something to aspire to, a good, comfortable life. And a realistic path to get there. And the reality that even if they can’t make it all the way, they can still do better than what they have. It can’t be Beyoncé or nothing. There has to be a path for those who are just ok. And then the investments give those people a reason to stay and raise the next generation, elevating the whole neighborhood, generation after generation. 

So why women? Well, women are the backbones of society, they’re the ones who end up taking care of children, of the elderly, of the sick. This is a broad generalization, but it’s also true. A society where women have choices is better for women (which is fifty percent of the population, so a plus!) better for children (they get better care, more resources, better education, better outcomes) and frankly, better for men (they were once those children, too)

In other words, this new generation has been taught that police will not charge, detain, or even try to deter them from committing certain crimes (DA not prosecuting, having to fight civil rights attorneys, their own department not backing them up for the sake of publicity) so they can’t fear consequences that do not exist.",18,2023,8,2,1,"1, 3"
jwug449,15v2e57,Dog_Admirer503,"you’re totally correct. I think white people around here are scared to say it from fear of sounding racist. I can usually tell who’s not really from around here when these conversations come up. 

I saw someone say year-round school as a solution and it makes zero sense. Do they really think the kids and young adults committing these crimes value and participate in school during the regular school year? On top of that, school teachers have little support from the school system so what would be the incentive for them to teach year round?

And I also agree on your point about our culture. It’s definitely the music, social media, and lack of guidance/parenting. A lot of these kids don’t value life and are influenced by music which values fast money, drugs, and you said it… killing other people.

Can you point to which of the things I suggested investing in as a bad idea? These are all things that, as you point out, fall mostly on women to accomplish (in all societies) was it child care? Education? Care of the sick? Elder care? Recreation? Shopping? Rehabilitation? Housing? So I say let’s invest in things that make all those things easier. So that the burden falls across all of society, not just women, and you’re opposed to that? I’m saying let’s make life a bit easier so that women have more time and energy (both physical and emotional) to invest in themselves, their families and their communities  which, as you point out, they already do, disproportionally (again, in all societies, we just happen to be talking about a particular one) change ‘Beyoncé’ to ‘Taylor Swift’ And we could be saying the same thing about Appalachia. (Or whoever the right superstar is, I don’t know) 

I was in no way intending to assign blame for the crime problem to women, simply saying that a proven way out of generational poverty is empowerment of women.

Parroting one of the oldest racist talking points is not ""thoughtful"". This ""one particular issue"" is one of the most harmful and community destroying ""issues"" in America over the last century.

Crime isn't associated with race, policing is.

**In DC:**

Police stop black people at a population proportionally adjusted rate of 4 to 1 compared to white people.

5% of stops for white people and 86% of stops for black people lead to no ticket/arrest.

Of the stops that lead to no ticket/arrest, 91% of the victims searched were black.

In majority-white neighborhoods, black people make up the overwhelming majority of non-traffic stops.

The perception that crime is associated with race is directly tied to racist police tactics and bias. It isn't ""generally true"", it is demonstratively false. Perpetuating this myth is racist and directly contributes to the issue of racist policing.

Crime isn't associated with race, it is associated with racism, socioeconomic factors, and biased policing.

It *is* generally true that black people are disproportionately accused of crimes and are vastly disproportionately not likely to have committed those crimes.

Having a victim helps to provide evidence and a compelling story at trial, but is far from necessary to bring charges or to obtain a conviction. If your understanding were the case, murderers would be immune from charges because their victims couldn't complain. I suspect that this misunderstanding comes from the popular belief that victims bring charges -- but they don't. In your DV example, what you misunderstand is that police may still bring DV charges against the aggressor -- it's just harder to do so in DV cases because there is likely insufficient evidence to sustain a conviction without the victim's testimony, so they frequently don't. 

Here, there is video evidence of the individual committing attempted battery by throwing a rock at the woman. That is likely sufficient evidence, even absent victim testimony, to bring charges. Moreover, OP mentioned that he was chased by the individual who pulled something out of his bag. That goes to a separate crime, but remains a potential charge.",51,2019,4,2,1,0

I am one of 3 people in my friend group who left DC this year due to no longer feeling safe there, specifically as women. Remote jobs tend to be higher salaried, so DC is losing its higher tax contributors in this way. It's a domino effect that will just continue to weaken the city fiscally.

Mental health services across all age groups have come up time and time again for funding, volunteering opportunities, awareness, action.  While strides have been made in certain areas, others - and often individuals themselves - end up being neglected by the system and society.  It's a cycle.  

The police have been - sometimes appropriately so - villainized. Too much action or too little.  They are not mental health professionals.  They are not youth specialists.  They are frequently overworked, angry, fatigued, under high stress and pressure, and all this with the ability to kill on their hip and the ability to get away with it pinned to their chest.

One of the reasons I disagree with overpolicing what people say is that all they do is learn to be more clever in how they say things.

Like if someone refers to me as the ""N"" word I would rather that because then I know how that person feels without a doubt.  But if someome is able to just use other words to mean the same thing then it's more difficult to determine their true intentions.",5,2024,1,2,1,0

The WH and Dem Senate could always prioritize getting judges confirmed, seeing as how they care soooo much about DC.",5,2024,1,2,1,"1, 3"
