l0cxcbe,1c85kwu,skratchpikl202,"DC is fairly progressive when it comes to offenders' rights. We are ""ban the box"" and there is a time limit that certain criminal records can be reported. Coming from the recovery community myself, I know of people with felonies/extensive prison and jail sentences that have careers and have moved forward in their lives, and most are still living in DC/VA/MD. Will you get a job at a bank next week? No way. Could you feasibly have a favorable adjudication for a federal government position in a couple of years? Yes. And there are plenty of other jobs in between--restaurants (which I know can be danger zones, so ymmv), recovery related jobs, trades, etc. There are programs that I'm aware of in DC and MD that help get people in similar situations into positions or trades. 

First step, though, might be linking up with the recovery community. DC has an interesting mix--from LEO to government employees to service industry folks to others who took the path of working in the recovery community directly (local government agencies, rehabs, etc.). I think you'll be able to get a good idea of what options are available to you once you start building a network there.

There are a ton of NA, AA, and other 12-step meetings in the area. Feel free to reach out with any questions.

Edit: Your wife said to work on yourself and not worry about financials at the moment, correct? Do that. Seriously. I'm sure you know how fragile recovery is, so focus on that if you're not up against the wall on a job, money, etc. Build that network in the recovery community and work toward improving yourself on a day-to-day basis.

1. DC is EXPENSIVE. Have a plan to support yourself before you come here and research housing costs/etc.
2. Don't underestimate yourself. Aim high and settle lower if you have to, but don't think you have to start really low
3. Use your network as much as possible, especially people that work at private companies that might have more hiring power
4. On the side strongly consider building up your own small business where no one can prevent you from what you want to do
5. If you think any of your addiction is trauma based be sure to treat that with therapy. Most addiction has roots in other issues. Staying social and avoiding isolation is a huge piece of the puzzle as well.

l0e5yw0,1c85kwu,messyredemptions,"I see other posts mentioning you're considering various college programs, make the most of the potential social/professional connections and also the brand of being a University /College student because it can give you opportunities and room to experiment+ learn in ways that other professionals might not (things can get a lot more competitive once people are squarely in the workforce), and a big part of the college education perk is your opportunity to access a lot of people and information, many of whom you can continue to cultivate a connection with beyond the campus and program after graduating.¬†


¬†Keep an eye out for expungement opportunity programs too.¬† It sounds like your case might be something that could be considered in similar light to how a lot of people got incarcerated for marijuana until it began getting legalized in many places. Albeit the opioid pharmaceutical industry still has an ongoing hand in creating a crisis, there may be something out there that pops up down the road.


Also prioritize figuring out what kinds of companies/employers and jobs tend to hire at your college if you do take that route and what the typical pay might be before you fully lock into a major.


I say this speaking as someone who got a degree in something that's technically important to society (environmental science) but constantly undervalued unless cleaning up after an oil spill or other disasters that industry wants to profit off of.


A lot of social workers are exploited ( underpaid similarly to a lot of police officers while often doing very similar things; not sure about what corrections administration can offer so do your own diligence, I'm just spouting outsider opinion), it might not payback as well especially if you're using student loans to get the degree unless there's some very solid angle/niche on how to make money beyond case work for an agency, or you have an entrepreneurial team that can a hit a home run with some new way of doing things (look into Defy Ventures if that's a potential path of interest in terms of entrepreneurs who had served their terms).


So maybe aviation mechanic work might be a more financially suitable payoff for learning and the skills can probably translate to other mechanic fields too like automotive or other transportation sectors. Though I don't know how placements can work out with the corrections record.

It was extremely hard for him to find stable work with a record. Minimum wage and under the table labor jobs where about it for him for about 5 years after moving here. And most of that was work outside of the city. He eventually got a good job working in a kitchen and he's still there.

DC has allot of profile, and allot of people. So decent high paying jobs tend to be very picky. Government work will be hard to get and some places require a security clearance for office and security jobs. 

When you get here don't be discouraged if it's a hard time adjusting and just keep pushing those resumes. Try to avoid Indeed or other job sites most of those are a waist of time. call the businesses or walk in and ask to speak with hiring managers.

Something very important to note: UDC's graduation rate is less than 20% which is about as bad as it gets. A lot of that is because it's¬†the only public college (I believe) in DC, so it's also the de facto community college as well.


It doesn't mean the professors are bad, it's just that a lot of people don't know what they want to do in life, and UDC is the only affordable way to try the college route (unless you're getting scholarships to another school). Many decide it's not for them.¬†

They're worth considering and discussing especially if it can get more people on your team to look for good paths forward with you, but also it'll be important to manage hopes and expectations with whatever realities exist.¬†¬†¬†


¬†But usually what's needed for anyone to do well, returning or not, is an ecosystem & community of support, not just sheer will and a desire to do good (though having those things helps too!). Things may look and be very different for you on the ground when it comes time to knock on doors and make the calls.¬†




¬†A few other thoughts: ¬†in case the college or school or trade you're looking at might notnhave the kinds of opportunities or jobs or networks that might be most conducive to you, there may be others that do.¬†




Find ways to put yourself in a position to choose but reaching out and learning what you can.¬†¬†




A technique that's used in sales and purchasing plus negotiations is to prospect multiple places, like 3 or 5 more ‚Äì I sometimes try to find 8 for the saoe of being aboe to manage what I'm looking at before narrowing it down to a few, and others may go up to the double digits or even three digits when they're applying for jobs for example ‚Äì so that there's a range of choices and options I can compare.¬†


It also gives you real reminders that walking away from a bad opportunity is a real option for you in negotiations too.¬†




¬†And I agree with your partner ‚Äì regardless of the career path you take, use this time to invest in cultivating yourself and any potential deep healing too.¬†


Find personal development¬† assessments and programs like taking a strengths finder assessment (and other things like it to know what you bring to a table and how to translate it to industry recruiters/interviewers), learn Emotional Intelligence skills, conflict transformation skills, be trauma informed and how to heal from anything that might be there, take up yoga or an internal martial art, whatever to help nourish and bring clarity to who you are without needing too much external validation from society.¬†


¬†You don't have to do all of it, get certified, or engage in any of it if you don't want to of course, but once you start the clock in school or a normal job it's a lot more challenging to work on yourself and grow unless you have good habits for prioritizing what it means to be in touch with yourself and your needs.




I say this because the working world can often try to take whatever it can extract out of a person especially in a place like the DC region where government and contractors are in the habit of replacing transient working people for profits.¬†


¬†Another place that came to mind which may be a very helpful resource is the DC mediation center. They've worked with formerly incarcerated returning citizens and also have staff who are very familiar with reintegration and it's challenges too: https://communitymediationdc.org/¬†

kxqc97d,1btzbaj,600George,"That's not really the history of the Navy Yard area. Fifteen years ago, Navy Yard was not a bad neighborhood so much as it wasn't a neighborhood at all. It had some industrial areas like the trash transfer station and a few cement plants and a lot of two story warehouse buildings. Some of those warehouses were empty and decaying in place, some were being used as auto repair places, and a few had been been converted into art studios. There was at any given time one or two large night clubs in warehouse spaces and a small strip of gay bars that tended to attract closeted men from the suburbs (and cops who would harass them, but that's another story).  Oh yeah, and some part of the intelligence community had a giant windowless (the windows were literally filled in with cinder blocks) building right on M Street that loomed over the area and fed all sorts of conspiracy theories. I think it actually had something to so with spy satellites. There was also a run down horse stable owned by a woman who would give carriage rides around the city. 

The vibe in Navy Yard was more creepy than dangerous. There weren't a lot of criminals since there weren't any people to victimize. Just block after block of nothing, especially at night. 

Two major events changed things. First, the Navy announced that it was moving a bunch of offices from Crystal City to the Navy Yard. Each of those offices was supported by private military contractors who came along and needed places to set up shop. The only office building at the time was the Maritime Plaza at the east end of M St, so new buildings were needed. US Department of Transportation helped out a bit by moving its HQ from L'Enfant Plaza to a new building on M St (and DOT employees were not happy when they made the move since nothing else on M St was built yet). 

Second, the city announced that it was building a baseball stadium in the area and would buy up many of the warehouses to create a new neighborhood. What the city didn't buy or get through eminent domain, the private developers bought up. 

Somewhere online there is or was a blog that tracked the changes in the Navy Yard area and has a lot more information on the history of the area. 

Bottom line, Navy Yard isn't going anywhere. Not unless the Nationals move and the Navy closes up shop. 

By the way, whatever happened to the gay bars? Councilmember Jim Graham tried to get some space for them near DuPont Circle, but the bars couldn't afford those types of rents and, quite frankly, the rest of that areas didn't really want these seedy places moving in. Another plan was to let them operate rent free in the underground trolley tunnel under DuPont, but that never came to pass and they just disappeared, I guess.",67,2024,4,2,1,"1, 6"

What‚Äôs happening is probably management being worried about lawsuits, first from the resident(s) causing problems, who can complain that their rights have been violated in the event they notify others about an ‚Äúalleged‚Äù incident, and from you, for failure to uphold lease terms, which is why they don‚Äôt want to put anything in writing. 

It‚Äôs not how it should be, but sadly I‚Äôve heard this story many times from different buildings. The downside to DC‚Äôs strong tenant protection laws is that there isn‚Äôt much that building management can do in the short term to deal with residents who are causing problems. Legally, they are innocent until proven guilty (which, conservatively, will take more than a year) and building management isn‚Äôt able to  treat them differently than any other resident. 

At the end of the day, all you can really do is share your experience. You might consider trying to meet with your councilmember‚Äôs office, just to get their take on whether you can additional recourse to get out of your lease.

To your point about these gay bars having a hard time relocating: as soon as the city repossessed them, the City Council passed a law stating that there can only be 2 nude bars per Ward.

Basic, general advice about city life applies: don't flash around cash after dark while alone and visibly lost, for starters. I can't think of any part of of the city where that would be a good idea, but it's probably a little more important around H Street than in a residential neighborhood or in a truly rural area. Also, don't focus so much on a podcast or Facebook or phone game that you're oblivious to your surroundings. 

Beyond that, it's unhelpful to lump together all possible kinds of bad city experiences. A pushy beggar, a premeditated mugging, and an attack by an insane person off their meds are all bad, but they're all three completely different problems with three completely different responses.

Second, Mazda‚Äôs are a pretty niche brand at this time. The popularity has grown but ultimately it‚Äôs not a target for theft. I researched pretty heavily before I bought my 3‚Ä¶..it‚Äôs routinely in the lowest theft rankings in the US and it‚Äôs not really a target for part stripping bc the sales are modest at best. Fun fact, there were as many thefts of Honda Civics in 2022 as there were Mazda 3‚Äôs sold in the US. The CX-5 is the best selling Mazda model so your target ratio goes up if you have a CX-5 but it‚Äôs still pretty low. 



Third, if you insist on bringing the vehicle, please note that alley spots are less safe than street parking on a number of levels. Less eyes on the vehicle and even more important far more likely to attract rodents. Most streets at least have some movement through the night. Especially main ones.

More often, or the vast majority of murders are documented as the victim being acquainted with their killer. A large amount of the heavily politicized (by the right) murders are circumstances where two acquainted individuals have conflict and they‚Äôre usually Black adolescents or young adults between the ages of 15 and 25. 

I say this because most of the commenters here appear to be White. It‚Äôs very likely that demographic is not going to be the victim of murder when the context of the murder rate is included.

I do have a car though, so I also appreciate the easy access to 295/395 and the BW Parkway for weekend exploring almost as much as I love not needing to ever sit in rush hour traffic.

Other than around July 4, it‚Äôs remarkable how quiet it is, especially compared to places I lived when I was a renter (like on East Capitol). Never hear my neighbors, and almost never hear any noise at night. It‚Äôs a real warren of narrow one-way streets up here but I kinda like that people usually don‚Äôt come on my street without a reason. All that through traffic is what made East Capitol so noisy. You definitely see mostly familiar faces coming and going in the mornings and afternoons and I like that classic small town within the city feel.

But it is still a kickass neighborhood if you know 1) what you want, and 2) what you‚Äôre willing (able) to put up with.

That depends a lot on self-knowledge: Your past urban experiences, your noise tolerance, whether you know how to deal with pockets of crime in different forms, deal with winos and junkies and trash littering the streets and bike lanes.

The tradeoff can be incredibly cheap rent, in absolutely beautiful housing, with a fantastic commute, and few nuisances other than noise, strung out bums littering the local metro stop, and occasionally the sound of gunshots in the distance at night (if you keep your windows open).

When I first came to DC, I initially moved to Capitol Hill after several years living in a megacity in the global south (I won‚Äôt say which, but est. 20+ mln pop.) and prior to that, a very ghetto segment of a major American city - both for work. Mind you, I‚Äôm originally from NYC, so Im used to living in big cities.

Capitol Hill was BORING AS HELL for me at first. I left in the early pandemic (not by choice), and wound up in Columbia Heights.

Now that I‚Äôm nearly 5 years older now, there are times I visit Capitol Hill and wonder wtf I did by leaving there.

What I can tell you is that I‚Äôve met plenty of people who grew up in very rural areas who have negative reactions to living in loud city neighborhoods. Columbia Heights is one of those neighborhoods, especially in the summer, and particularly if you live near the metro or on 16th. There is almost constant noise and stimulation. If you grew up in a very quiet area where people left their doors unlocked, proverbially speaking, Columbia Heights will take some adjustment. If you grew up in, say, Queens, you might not mind. But noise pollution has a real effect on people. 

Additionally, if you don‚Äôt know how to watch your back coming home from the bar late at night, or think it‚Äôs cool to leave your garage unlocked for a few days- you‚Äôre in for a surprise. But theres very little if any crime that youll encounter if you have some basic street smarts. 

Bike lanes are kind of a mess in Columbia Heights. Should be the easiest way to get around in DC, but instead it‚Äôs a liability to life and limb. You can bike this area easily if you‚Äôre going laterally, to Mt Pleasant or other adjacent areas for groceries, errands or fun - but I‚Äôd recommend against commuting by bike all the way down 16th St. to downtown. Take the S2 bus instead (it‚Äôs a breeze), don‚Äôt risk your life.

The metro is great to have here too, and as long as you‚Äôre not living on the main drag (very loud area), then walking to the metro is fine. It‚Äôs messy, yeah, but I‚Äôve never once felt unsafe.

I‚Äôm in my early 30s, and no, this area is absolutely not ‚Äúcar required.‚Äù If anything it‚Äôs ‚Äúcar liability‚Äù - mine‚Äôs been broken into twice and I‚Äôve seen cars parked on the street once or twice magically lose all four wheels over night. 

It‚Äôs honestly one of the best locations in DC if you can stomach a bit of roughness. Believe me, no matter what you think of this area day to day, you‚Äôll always thank yourself for choosing a spot near Rock Creek Park.

And the adjacent neighborhoods are some of DC‚Äôs best hidden gems: Purple Patch, Red Derby, Lymann‚Äôs, Chicatana‚Ä¶


Im giving you Columbia Heights‚Äô nitty-gritty details in most blunt form so you know realistically what to expect. The ‚Äúhorrid‚Äù reputation this neighborhood has is entirely undeserved, an infantile fantasy of DC‚Äôs pearl-clutching mimosa crowd who need something - or someone - to look down on and belittle because they can‚Äôt yet afford a mcmansion in the suburbs like mom and dad.

kgymz60,191pur6,jackiejorp-jomp,"Not trends per se, but overall positives‚Ä¶

I‚Äôm a transplant here and have lived in several other cities. I love how clean it is to walk around on a daily basis. I know that cleanliness comes with some negative politics sometimes, but this city was designed around (and invests heavily in) being a picture-perfect ode to the US for tourists, and it shows, at least in NW. Trash isn‚Äôt left out in heaps in the street √† la NY, no human feces or urine to skirt around on every block‚Ä¶buildings aren‚Äôt a haphazard mix of low-cost builds but overall cohesive and either stately or quaint rowhouses. Very few major cities are as well kept up.

Nature is a very short drive away. Not only in Rock Creek Park, which feels way more rural than any other large urban parks I‚Äôve been in, but also the MD and VA state park 30 mins away by car are something you‚Äôre hard pressed to find in many cities around the world in such close proximity, not just the US. Essential as a dog parent and nature lover. Being 100% in an urban environment every single day makes me a little nuts. Having a quick escape is essential.

It‚Äôs easier to make friends here than other cities. I‚Äôm not saying people here are the warmest on the outset (because many are type A), but because of it‚Äôs transient nature, most people I‚Äôve met are eager to make new friends and are way less clique-ish than other (mainly West Coast) cities.

Free social stuff to do. Not just the museums, but outdoor street festivals etc. make it so even those on a tight budget can socialize outside the home without spending a boatload (not possible in a lot of other cities, where even many of the street festivals require paid entry).

Truly beautiful sunsets not blocked by towering buildings. I honestly love skyscrapers, but the fact that we can actually see the sky from anywhere even with the urban setting is pretty clutch.

As someone mentioned, the seasons. I didn‚Äôt grow up with this, but it‚Äôs a nice break up of the year, and each season has a distinct character and something to look forward to. Also, each season really does seem to last in 3-4 month chunks so they don‚Äôt get overwhelming. Some cities really have a 9-month winter followed by two weeks of spring, an epically hot summer, and then two weeks of fall. Our seasons are way more evenly paced and mellow while still being distinct.

Rooftop pools (and rooftops available for public use in general). These are way more prevalent here than in a lot of other cities that I‚Äôve found (and not epically expensive to use), with a hot enough summer to enjoy them. I‚Äôm a big fan.

WALKABLE. A surprising number of cities are clusters of walkable neighborhoods with stretches of misery connecting them as a pedestrian. DC is in an elite class (for the US) of cities where you can walk between three-quarters of the city fairly easily, without having to walk along a freeway. In fact, most of the walk will be quite picturesque and pleasant (saying this as someone who‚Äôs walked from NE to the wharf before, both through NW and through SE).

Rent isn‚Äôt cheap, but the apartments are way bigger than what you‚Äôd get in NY or SF (or father out, like London or Paris) and overall kept up better for the same relative $ amount.

Having a rail line connecting us between here and all cities east until Boston within a few short hours is huge. Really doesn‚Äôt exist west of us in the US. Rail is slow as a snail and convoluted to get from major city to major city in most of the US.

A good middle ground pace. Doesn‚Äôt have the sleepy suburban pace of cities like Denver, doesn‚Äôt feel like a massive connection of suburbs with a tiny downtown like San Diego, and also doesn‚Äôt have the frenetic aggressive energy of NY. Some might say those are drawbacks, but for people who want a city vibe without so much of the shouting and chaos of NY (don‚Äôt get me wrong, I do love NY), DC is a great sweet spot.

Every city has its unique charms, and every city is going *through* it. We‚Äôre tuned in through the local headlines we consume to think it‚Äôs just DC, but rising crime, price gouging, angry drivers, etc. is a problem in most places (those cities‚Äô respective subreddits will confirm). And caused by issues that happen at a national level (lack of access to affordable healthcare, lack of income and/or housing assistance, quality education, etc.) and not just issues we are dealing with in DC in a bubble.

We can‚Äôt be too cynical or pessimistic to press for the [right kinds of interventions](https://newrepublic.com/article/177907/violent-crime-crisis-washington-dc). Additionally, violent crime nationwide is going down, so there‚Äôs always the chance that DC is just lagging behind but will ultimately fall in line with the broader trend. 

Second, there‚Äôs turnover and change, but not all of it is bad. Restaurants are closing but [new ones are opening](https://www.axios.com/local/washington-dc/2024/01/05/best-new-restaurant-openings-2024-pascual-pastis).

That‚Äôs not even considering the fact that DC is still the best place in the country for queer people, which evinces a deeply diverse and tolerant city. 

Lastly, there is meaningful progress being made to fix our issues. SNAP is being expanded to help more needy families, truancy issues are being tackled by adding attractive programming instead of incarceration and punishment, and leaders in our city are countering Bowser‚Äôs garbage punitive approach to crime with actual substance that, if adequately funded and monitored, could make DC a model for crime prevention.

I live in a city that is pretty beloved as a European destination. I really enjoyed being in DC again. It's so walkable compared to other US cities. There's so much great food. Despite living for a very long time in a city with hardly any violent crime, I don't find DC nearly as terrifying as it seems many more recent transplants do. The whole city feels much safer and infinitely more connected neighborhood-to-neighborhood than it did when I lived in it. I walked from point As to point Bs I never would have dreamed of traversing 20 years ago. There's more activity, it's more densely populated and feels more like a thriving city in that way. Metro is working so much better.

The music scene is really great. I hope you all appreciate how vibrant it is given the size of the city. Gogo is a damn national treasure and it's going strong. There are fantastic record stores and venues of all sizes. Really talented local musicians.

I think the crime hysteria is a bit out of control. There's so much more information available now. Too much. Nextdoor is a total scourge. I hope DC employs the strategy that worked before, which was to focus on the tiny minority of people who are causing the most havoc.

As You Are and Shakers opened which are way more welcoming than the likes of Kiki and Uproar. Trade has really stepped up as a queer bar and not a gay men's bar with little things like their bathroom redecoration. 

I really value the mixing of and normalizing of queer spaces and getting away from the monoculture. It's totally valid for all the genders to have a space to call their own, but it's insanely valuable to mix and mingle amongst each other. A lot of these spaces are grass roots, and many of the old events fell off after the pandemic. It's amazing to see this scene grow and come back in a way that just didn't exist 5-10 years ago.

If I'm missing any I'd love to hear more!",4,2024,1,2,1,0
kgzocvu,191pur6,Laterface,"Stop reading the news and go out and live your life. Give yourself a three day moratorium on news and social media (esp next door). It‚Äôs too cold for the arboretum but warm up with a walk inside the botanical garden, then walk up the hill and get a taco or more at Santa Rosa. Go down to eastern market and get a coffee and then hit navy yard for a beer anywhere. Don‚Äôt like beer? Go the other direction and hit the free multibillion dollar array of stimulation that is the National Mall. Got money to burn, hit the W and check out the panoramic view in the roof bar.

But even if you stay home, stop reading the news because it‚Äôs their business to only report what‚Äôs wrong with everything. In their defense, nobody cares to read about things going right. There‚Äôs zero money in it. But I promise if you stop looking at news for 3 days you will feel better.

Oh it couldnt possibly be because of a recent former President constantly denigrating our community and blaming us for ""kung flu"", while stoking the fires of xenophobia with his statements on US-China relations.

Or perhaps its because of the often perpetuated model minority myth that serves to drive a wedge between us and our fellow minorities in this country.  When its convenient, some people like to prop us up as a ""great example"" of how ""working hard and studying can bring great success to all"".  

Or maybe its because of historically based and deep-rooted anti-Asian attitudes and legislation like the Chinese Exclusion Act.  Even now, many of our fellow Americans dont seem to understand that, we too, are also American no matter where our ancestors may have came from.  

You think it popped up around COVID? My friend, like every other minority, we've been unwelcome since we first got here.  COVID just brought it to some peoples radar.

EDIT:  Its funny how nowhere in my comment did I say the individuals being racist or violent to Asian-Americans have to be exclusively of any political ideology, race, or demographic but the people in this thread can't help but project their own biased thoughts.  Anyone and everyone can express anti-Asian sentiments from a micro level to a very blatant level.  It's also very telling that I mention this is a multi-faceted, complex, and deeply ingrained historic problem but somehow people read my first paragraph, say Im ""obfuscating the problem"" and then suddenly forget that they are literate for the rest of my comment.  More proof that non-Asians like to co-opt these types of conversations to use their own racist dog whistles and further their own agenda. 

And by the way, nowhere here did I say Trump and Republicans are the sole cause of this.  Nowhere here did I say Black individuals (and other minorities for that matter) are incapable of anti-Asian sentiments.",67,2023,5,2,1,0

‚ÄúA misread of a frequently cited study from this year, published in the American Journal of Criminal Justice, likely contributed to the spread of erroneous narratives, Wong said. The study, which examined hate crime data from 1992 to 2014, found that compared to anti-Black and anti-Latino hate crimes, a higher proportion of perpetrators of anti-Asian hate crimes were people of color. Still, 75 percent of perpetrators were white.‚Äù",3,2023,5,2,1,0

Stricter, more aggressive law enforcement could stem the problem in the short term, but it could also put innocent people at risk if things become violent, it wouldn't guarantee that stores would go back to the way they were, and it wouldn't address what motivates people to steal in the the first place.

Officers at the scene said they found two guns and more than 20 shell casings.

**Q**: Would the bike lane on Connecticut make it a single lane in each direction for cars?

**A:** Thanks for reading and asking a substantive question! This is probably a much longer answer than you expected, but I don't have any other place to dump this backstory.

The 3.2-mile segment we've been arguing about has a few different cross-section configurations, and DDOT's preliminary ""Concept C"" design alternative maintained 2 vehicle travel lanes in most spots. In fact, the agency preferred to keep that second travel lane instead of retaining curbside parking, something they are also doing on the East Capitol safety project in Ward 7, where they've unnecessarily pit parking against safe-for-all bike layouts. The planners get scared when their severely outdated traffic models give them bad grades, so they often prefer to axe parking that serves residents so thru-drivers who live in MD and VA aren't mad.

In heavy commercial blocks, DDOT would reduce the second vehicle lane on CT Ave to retain targeted location parking areas. Before the Mayor canceled the bike lanes, DDOT narrowed the planned bike lanes to fit a few more parking spots. Another important aspect of the previous preferred design is that they added ""turning pockets"" so that left-turn attempts would not back up travel in a general traffic lane. In traffic modeling, this improves ""vehicle level of service"" such that drivers get reduced travel times as the turning vehicles get out of the way. There were Forest Hills Connection stories about many of these design choices and past public meetings but the Connection's website is down now. The Ward3Bikes group is a good place to ask for information, as they've been tracking the discussion of the project's community advisory group for many years.

This project is enigmatic of a problem DDOT has when designing high-profile, multimodal safety projects. It's an issue with their IMPD division, which does giant projects fine (Douglass Bridge) and constantly fumbles ""medium-scale"" projects like CT Avenue. There are passionate, capable folks who work there that are now, I swear, finally starting to choose safety instead of old-school bullshit transportation design thinking. But, rarely do our elected leaders enable them to favor safety. Only some selected councilmembers (see diff between Frumin and T. White on this), some ANCs, and only sometimes the Mayor depending on that quarter's CRE interest thoughts regarding the business value of a parking spot vs. a customer or worker arriving by bike. It is not a coincidence that the C Street NE re-do in Kingman Park/Hill East is the gold standard of this kind of project (W6 represented by Tommy Wells, then Charles Allen) compared to a bunch of potential roads with safety fixes in Ward 8.

The District has a lot of very dangerous 6- and 4-lane roads with ""rush-hour restricted"" curbside parking. Rush hour restricted parking is almost always really dumb from a design and safety perspective as that extra vehicle travel lane only serves the goal of making major arterial roads eject In/Out car commuters like it's 1957 and the father from Leave it to Beaver needs to get home to see Beav's baseball practice. From a parking supply and operations perspective, again, it's outdated. Much of D.C. DPW's very limited tow and boot crew is devoted to rush-restricting parking enforcement instead of any number of higher-value community safety goals like finding cars with thousands of dollars of unpaid speeding tickets. And, again, the narrative for that rush-restricted parking is the 9-to-5 office worker comes home and can have that spot from 6 PM to 7 AM, like we all have traditional biz hour jobs and don't work hybrid schedules or the third shift.

If you look, you'll see safety opportunities throughout your daily travel across our city. CT Ave is a prominent example of what should be a 6-to-4 or 6-to-3 road diet with protected bike lanes and prioritization 24/7 enforced pick-up/drop-off and handicapped parking or a second travel lane in different segments based on the adjacent land use. Since 2022, the Mayor has gradually injected herself into the CT process to take space away from bikes based on some understandable resident and biz concerns -- but mostly some bullshit ignorant and/or powerful people think. The latest concept that's been discussed in the press -- a 6-to-4 road diet with the curbside lanes being turned into permanent parking everywhere -- is such a phenomenal waste of opportunity as to inspire my suggested Council action on the matter: force-protected bike lanes in that extra space or defund the whole project. CT Avenue NW from Dupont to MD is one of our city's primary transportation corridors and has priority for future improvements on both transit and bike within the master transportation plan. If transportation safety planning was the West Wing, doing an expensive parking improvement project like this would inspire mass resignations.",9,2024,4,2,1,"1,5"

I am not sympathetic to the ‚Äúfuck cars‚Äù movement or the ‚Äúreplace progress with bikes‚Äù movement. I wanted to read and take your post seriously, and I appreciated you citing your sources. As a matter of fact I will concede that at least some of your points are fact-based. For instance, you referenced the problem of ‚Äúrisk homeostasis‚Äù in traffic environment design.

Unfortunately, peppering facts into a bullshit soup propped up by citations with no value whatsoever does not a coherent argument make.

I stopped reading your post because, I went to one of your sources, which you used to support your claim that enforcement is deeply flawed (though I respect that you regarded it as ‚Äúeffective‚Äù).

I went in and read the transcript of the podcast addressing that issue. Now in fairness it is a transcript of a 16-minute podcast, and there‚Äôs only so much you can say in 16 minutes. Fine. But their entire premise, that automated traffic enforcement cannot be used, is based on their claims that a) cameras in zip codes with a higher concentration of black and brown people generate more revenue, b) more people living in zip codes with higher concentrations of black and brown people get automated traffic enforcement tickets, and c) ticketing them for speeding or running a stop sign is unjust because it‚Äôs JUST failing to stop before the line or going X mph over speed limit nbfd. 

Therefore they argue that, punishing people for traffic offenses is racist, and that, instead, we should focus on controlling people‚Äôs behavior. That is, rather than control speeding via enforcement to convince people to act in a civil manner, we should instead engineer the world in such a manner that would make it impossible for these individuals to act in an aberrant manner even if they wanted to. This preposterous argument is racist in itself, in that it implies that black and brown people have no capacity for rational thought and so their behavior must be controlled. It‚Äôs absolutely offensive and outrageous.

Plenty of people here loved your post. That‚Äôs fine. But it‚Äôs not enough to convince me that we ought to submit to a small, vocal, often disturbed minority of the population in their efforts to undo a century of progress (bike enthusiasts, e.g., the indignant stop sign running type) would therefore make great republicans, but make shitty neighbors.

Sorry, but fuck your bike and your stupid arguments. Ride the metro like the rest of us.

I think the most transformational self-reflection I've had is to understand that my paradigms of thinking about infrastructure and public space are \*incredibly radical\* in America -- and to find power and pride in that self-knowledge. My primary source of angst is the world and people in the world not understanding and agreeing with all of my thoughts about transportation X climate X social justice X housing X economic development. But, our salvation as radicals is that most people in general and in America are practical above all else.

Learning from the wisdom of our forebears, we know progress on tough issues is incremental and sometimes all at once in the last few years. So, every small win of a protected bike lane next to a CitiBike station in a CitiBike network with more e-bikes means more people will ride. Compared to Electric Cars, E-bikes are much closer to being practical for people in urban and streetcar-suburban environments. And truly, I think e-bikes will change the world with every little notch. We can make it practical to take a bike instead of a car or connect to transit for the last/first mile.

I am also a systems thinker, and working now with the intersection of all built infrastructure, there are intersectional dynamics all over the place: ""Straight piping"" wastewater in poor, rural communities where there is also no public transit, for example. And, honestly, the most impactful thing we can do is often be a quiet, reasonable outlier. I take transit and then an e-bike to meetings in D.C.'s exurbs. People see me take off my helmet in the room. My first dates see my helmet strapped to my bag. I bike places because I believe in the transformative power of bikes. And I hope to die many years into the future when that transportation modal decision is an extremely boring and non-notable part of nearly every American's day, even if they have a setback SFH in a cul-de-sac -- because their suburb has hundreds of miles of trails connecting to essential destinations.",4,2024,4,2,1,"1, 7"

Another important aspect of the previous preferred design is that they added ""turning pockets"" so that left-turn attempts would not back up travel in a general traffic lane. In traffic modeling, this improves ""vehicle level of service"" such that drivers get reduced travel times as the turning vehicles get out of the way. There were Forest Hills Connection stories about many of these design choices and past public meetings but the Connection's website is down now. The Ward3Bikes group is a good place to ask for information, as they've been tracking the discussion of the project's community advisory group for many years.

This project is enigmatic of a problem DDOT has when designing high-profile, multimodal safety projects. It's an issue with their IMPD division, which does giant projects fine (Douglass Bridge) and constantly fumbles ""medium-scale"" projects like CT Avenue. There are passionate, capable folks who work there that are now, I swear, finally starting to choose safety instead of old-school bullshit transportation design thinking. But, rarely do our elected leaders enable them to favor safety. Only some selected councilmembers (see diff between Frumin and T. White on this), some ANCs, and only sometimes the Mayor depending on that quarter's CRE interest thoughts regarding the business value of a parking spot vs. a customer or worker arriving by bike. It is not a coincidence that the C Street NE re-do in Kingman Park/Hill East is the gold standard of this kind of project (W6 represented by Tommy Wells, then Charles Allen) compared to a bunch of potential roads with safety fixes in Ward 8.

The District has a lot of very dangerous 6- and 4-lane roads with ""rush-hour restricted"" curbside parking. Rush hour restricted parking is almost always really dumb from a design and safety perspective as that extra vehicle travel lane only serves the goal of making major arterial roads eject In/Out car commuters like it's 1957 and the father from Leave it to Beaver needs to get home to see Beav's baseball practice. From a parking supply and operations perspective, again, it's outdated. Much of D.C. DPW's very limited tow and boot crew is devoted to rush-restricting parking enforcement instead of any number of higher-value community safety goals like finding cars with thousands of dollars of unpaid speeding tickets. And, again, the narrative for that rush-restricted parking is the 9-to-5 office worker comes home and can have that spot from 6 PM to 7 AM, like we all have traditional biz hour jobs and don't work hybrid schedules or the third shift.

If you look, you'll see safety opportunities throughout your daily travel across our city. CT Ave is a prominent example of what should be a 6-to-4 or 6-to-3 road diet with protected bike lanes and prioritization 24/7 enforced pick-up/drop-off and handicapped parking or a second travel lane in different segments based on the adjacent land use. Since 2022, the Mayor has gradually injected herself into the CT process to take space away from bikes based on some understandable resident and biz concerns -- but mostly some bullshit ignorant and/or powerful people think. The latest concept that's been discussed in the press -- a 6-to-4 road diet with the curbside lanes being turned into permanent parking everywhere -- is such a phenomenal waste of opportunity as to inspire my suggested Council action on the matter: force-protected bike lanes in that extra space or defund the whole project. CT Avenue NW from Dupont to MD is one of our city's primary transportation corridors and has priority for future improvements on both transit and bike within the master transportation plan. If transportation safety planning was the West Wing, doing an expensive parking improvement project like this would inspire mass resignations.",4,2024,4,2,1,"1, 4"

D.C. has not implemented center-running cycletracks, other than Penn Ave NW, which was our first protected bike lane 15 years ago or so (I forget if 15th St NW PBLs came first). There is considerable difficulty with center-running designs when you consider turning movements of all traffic modes at intersections. The K Street NW transitway was going to have center running pbls outside the center-running BRT -- all concrete protected -- but the Mayor killed that bike lane and Council killed that entire project. Center-running was considered in Penn Ave SE in concept (next to the NPS-controlled median on both sides), but DDOT threw it out for turning ops considerations. The only active concept plan I'm aware of with center-running PBLs is Louisiana Avenue Cycletrack, which is currently killed by the Architect of the Capitol, Senate Sargeant at Arms, and Capitol Police (since those groups own and/or control LA Ave).",1,2024,4,2,1,0

l052j2v,1c6ncaj,the_BKH_photo,"So, I'm disabled and I DO NOT think that bike lanes or sidewalks are ableist. However, I do think that the movement against cars or for walkable/bikeable cities is largely ableist. First of all, wheelchairs aren't the only sign of a disabled person. I can walk, but due to my medical condition/disability, I can't walk for long periods without needing to sit and rest for a while and without experiencing excruciating pain. But I'm not in a wheelchair. Also, due to my condition/disability, I can't ride bikes because of the necessary exertion. Not only because of the pain and discomfort but also because I struggle to maintain weight since I no longer have a stomach. 

Second, not everyone who uses a wheelchair has the same level of dexterity or strength. Also, not all wheelchairs are the same. Some are made for specific activities like going on trails. Still, that's also a bit insensitive to think that those with disability which requires them to be in a wheelchair must have more than one wheelchair, along with who knows what other expensive equipment, in addition to a car, and exert much more effort than able bodies, just to enjoy the same places because those places are only being designed with able bodies in mind. So, to people who say they have seen those in a wheelchair in RCP or elsewhere, you likely have but also likely don't understand particulars and maybe should shut up. Just because it was done by those people doesn't mean it will be done again by those people because they may have found it too difficult, or they may have had a specialized wheelchair that better enables them.  I didn't even bother going to see cherry blossoms this year because I became disabled last spring, and there's no way I could have made it through all that madness this year. Unless something changes, I likely never get to see them again during peak.

I'm actually for car free zones of cities and towns. I'd prefer it for many many reasons, but the one thing often missing from the advocacy for more walkable/bikeable cities is appropriate design and public transportation ideas that would serve the disability community. Trams, light rails, bridges for pedestrians and cyclists to allow for such public transport, hubs on the edges of zones for those with disability to be able to drive and park to make the zones more accessible to us, and lots of places to sit. Most able bodies just think of more bike lanes and wider sidewalks and then slap some bus lanes nearby, and you're set. Not quite as helpful to all disabled folks. 

If you haven't heard of it, I recommend the podcast called The War on Cars. I listen with mixed emotions as 3 able bodies in NY bash cars and policy for 30 min to an hour.

Not that this is the proper place for such a discussion, and I am not a traffic engineer or even a cyclist, but one way of dealing with signalling for a two-way road with center bike lanes is to combine a three phase signal pattern and a left-turn prohibition.   The first signal phase would have a green for bikes (in the center bike lanes), pedestrians, and vehicles to go straight in either direction with no turns.  The second signal phase would have a green for cross traffic to go straight in either direction with no turns.  The third phase would have a green for right turns only for cars only in all directions (or, if the cross traffic road also has center bike lanes, a green for right turns only for cars and bikes only in all directions).  Bikes in the center bike lanes can turn in either direction by dismounting and using the pedestrian crosswalk during the second phase.  An advantage of this three phase approach is that none of the modes (bikes, vehicles, pedestrians) cross each other's path at any time, reducing chances for collisions.  Of course, no left turns for vehicles might be a non-starter for some.  Turning left for cyclists is possible but cumbersome, having to dismount and walk left with the pedestrians during the cross traffic green and then wait at the corner for the green in the other direction to get to other side of the street.",2,2024,4,2,1,0

Driving/transit is ok but usually involves at least some walking so it's not ideal. If I drive I never know how far I'll have to park, and it can be several blocks. The nearest Metro stop is already too far for me to walk comfortably without stopping and sitting down and there are a lot of bus stops without seating.¬†


On a bike I can almost always pull up right in front of wherever I'm going, no walking required.¬†Can't beat that for accessibility.¬†


I see the bike lanes not as a war on cars but as simply making room on the roads for people like me who want to get around in the city.¬†

Basically instead of taking just the northbound lanes, DCBP decided they had the right to cut off cross streets from cars going across or trying to head south on Connecticut. And because of their size they did this for several minutes.

In addition to a bunch of DCBPers also riding on the sidewalk, which is technically legal, but if you have a couple thousand people in the street already, is pretty obnoxious.

Driving on a highway with a 55 speed limit and the flow of traffic floating around 65-70 mph, there's an understood social construction that it's safer to move smoothly with the flow of traffic than to strictly adhere to speeds below the limit or even to go way over the speed limit, both of which would be unsafe. Moving with the flow of the rest of traffic at a speed often a bit above the speed limit in appropriate conditions to minimize differences in speed between vehicles is the safest approach.

Do you take the safer/sensible/efficient approach and flow along with traffic, or do you take a strictly legalistic ""the sign says 55""?

You're absolutely welcome to do the latter yourself if that's actually what you do all the time.

There is this strange and detached assumption that a city needs to be absolutely safe or free from tragedy. These tragedies are sad but as a 7-yr resident of the area, I can attest the area has never been so safe. Any peek-a-bo at crime stats will show a reduction in crime, especially if we judge crime per-capita. The area may even be getting too safe - aggressive gentrification may be pushing out the typical communities and businesses that would deter people from the sort of crimes you are referring to in the first place.  My comments here shouldn‚Äôt be seen as a defense of criminal activity, but the expectation that a dense area will be free from criminal activity is unrealistic.

eedvnei,ahdaid,,"> In general DC goes through cycles of good years and bad years.

Are you using anecdotal evidence, or actual data...?",-3,2019,1,2,1,0
eee6u8s,ahdaid,,"That may be a result of the 2015 spike. With that being said this is what I got when I looked into violent crimes in Ward 1, which is the area they are talking about.  **All violent crimes** **went down** **by** **394** **in Ward 1 during the past 2 years** **when compared to the previous 2 years.**

This is what I get when I am looking into violent crime over 5 years for Ward 1 specifically just to get more accurate data  on the 5 year basis.  **All violent crimes** **went down** **by** **1,770** **in Ward 1 during the past 5 years** **when compared to the previous 5 years**

So yeah Ward 1 is pretty much seeing a decrease in violent crime.

Also don't think the heat map is comparative. You really should be doing things on a ward by ward basis when doing analysis, and not necessarily citywide. Largely because Wards 7 and 8 really do skew the city wide statistics. Because DC west of the river and DC east of the river in terms of violent crimes kind of exist in two separate universes.

Also use the Ward tool when using the DC atlas as supposed to looking at

Again it really depends how you modify the data. I usually don't do five years because things can change over a five year period, and a one year spike can change the data. 2-3 years is a bit better.

Also I stress using VIOLENT crime as supposed to all crimes. Property crimes are up, but in large part because of package theft and theft from autos increased. The package theft issue increased with Amazon becoming more of a thing. This is pretty normal when a city is gentrifying. Violent crimes go down, property crimes go up. When talking about safety, it really is violent crime that is an issue, especially since the person is speaking about violent crime. ",6,2019,1,2,1,"1,8"

Ward 1 out of all the NW wards (there are 4) has always had more issues with violent and property crimes compared to the other 3 NW wards. 

I have been in DC long enough to know that Columbia Heights occasionally spikes, and has never been the best neighborhood of NW. NW in general though is still the safest area of the city (NW compromises most of Ward 4, Ward 3, Ward 2, and Ward 1). The issue here is with the densest area of NW, which is Ward 1. So please, be aware NW does not just equal Ward 1, and the problems in Ward 1. It is the largest quadrant of the city. That covers everything from Chevy Chase, DuPont Circle, Adams Morgan, Takoma, Shephard Park, etc. Much of NW, especially in Ward 3 and 4, is pretty sleepy residential neighborhoods on both sides of the park. Columbia Heights, U Street, and Shaw are not the entirety of NW. If we must refer to that area collectively, it is just better to call that specific area Ward 1, which is the densest ward in the city. Instead of NW.

Victor Frankl wrote that in his book, *Man‚Äôs Search For Meaning*, which he penned almost immediately following his experiences in Auschwitz, Dachau, and other concentration camps, where, among many other horrors, he came out as the sole survivor of his family. This was a situation in which people were stripped of their right and ability to seek *meaning and purpose* in what are considered traditional means. Things like experiencing new and exiting things, doing good works, building a family.

His observation was that those that survived were able to find meaning and purpose *in bearing up under and going through the suffering itself*, in spite of having family, liberty, and dignity utterly stripped from them. To justify the actions of the people in this video, whose life circumstances admittedly may not be spectacular, on the idea that their life/suffering is just so unbearable that this is a reasonable and understandable outcome is silly.

They have the right and freedom to pursue meaning and purpose in numerous other ways that don‚Äôt involve grand theft auto. The traditionally held and enjoyable paths of finding meaning and purpose are open to them. They‚Äôre free to travel around the country, experience new things, meet new people, form a family, indulge in hedonistic pleasures, or any number of other legal activities.

You'll have a greenway to jog on and some sort of body of water or woods with trails to experience nature in. It'll also be a lot more green even though most of the trees are young ones because the old forests have been clearcut in the past two decades to build the cookie cutter developments. 

There will still be a Whole Foods for groceries, a cultural anchor like an arts committee supplemented by an art gallery or independent bookstore (or at least a Barnes & Noble) with a coffee shop, and Amazon for everything else. There will be a couple breweries in an old factory or warehouse along with a vineyard at a defunct farm and they have an open mic night too.

There will be a sports team, either major or minor league, for you to root for. In the summers there will be a free weekly concert and/or movie series at a park. A farmers market will pop up. A harvest festival will occur whether agrarian activity takes place or not. The restaurant scene will still feature a bowl fast casual chain, a $$ mom and pop place, and at least one ethnic cuisine run by a multigenerational family of immigrants who were resettled after a war. There will be good pizza and there will be bad pizza.

Public transportation is either a novelty or just for poor people but that won't matter because you'll have a car. It's all built for cars with token walkable areas which aren't linked by sidewalks but you can park to walk around or pay extra to  live in one. And leisure cycling on the weekends has a club that will ride from brewery to brewery or on that greenway the joggers love.

DC is obviously a world class city. But a niche with the things people always ask about can be carved out anywhere - there's just going to be less of it and you'll need to travel for the luxury of experiencing more. Most of the free events in DC have been overcrowded since 2020 anyway. People need to disperse a bit. These other cities are not second cities. No one should act like such places are beneath them if they, by admission of leaving DC, can't adapt to whatever it would take to diminish their quality of life in order to stay in DC.

I'm pretty vocal about how much I prefer the DC metro area in so many ways to other cities and metro areas I've lived. Moved here from NYC, and while the public transportation and walkability is better in NYC, it isn't because it's cleaner or more efficient or easier to use, it's just that it's more stops, more coverage, and a third track for each line so you almost never have any single tracking or backups due to trains being ahead in the station. There are some drawbacks with that, though. Like how if there is a train broken down in station ahead of yours, you might unexpectedly now be on an express train for a few stops and then have to cross the platform to go back or just walk/cab/bus/bike to where you really wanted to go. But that's not super common in NYC. But I love the DC metro system much more for many reasons, like climate control. Lol. It's unbearable in NYC subway due to either heat or cold, depending on the station.

(And, also, the people in those places are accustomed enough to real winters that they understand how to clean snow off a car and don't feel the need to clear out the Safeway shelves when they see ‚ùÑ on the weather report. Unlike the DMV.) 

But, if you live in an area **like DC where the median snowfall *per year* is just 10 inches**, then investing in that winter defense infrastructure is a massive waste of taxpayer money. I mean, fuck, in the midwest 10 inches of snow is also known as ""a typical Tuesday morning."" 

So, yeah: we can all just suck it up for a few days until it's in the 60s again -- *in January, ffs* -- and count our lucky stars that we don't have to invest in silk longjohns and snow blowers.",12,2024,1,2,1,0

Pickup trucks. Small tractors. Front loader construction equipment. Heck, my dad's riding lawn mower has a plow attachment that my mom won't let him buy that would work.

Either they REALLY like to follow zoning and just happen to have made an account, or they're a real estate professional (i.e. Bozzuto), hence they know the lingo and are trying to cover it up.",2,2015,7,2,1,0
ct6llad,3din45,MediumPotato,"So, there are zoning regulations in DC that require a certain percentage of affordable dwelling units (ADUs) for new development and significant renovation/rehabilitation of existing buildings that is increasing the square footage by 50%. These kinds of inclusionary zoning (IZ) laws are found all across the country and different jurisdictions will refer to them by different names (Moderately Priced Dwelling Units or MPDUs for example). There is a common misconception amongst certain people, and certainly developers do nothing to discourage these impressions, that developers are strong armed into providing housing in their new developments that severely limits the profitability of the project and provides no benefit whatsoever to the owner. It is seen as liberal social engineering and trying to regulate progressive housing policy through manipulation, intimidation and onerous regulation. This is simply not the case. 

IZ comes with incentives, often in the form of tax credit or bonus density. These are both part of DC IZ zoning law. While these incentives often do not FULLY make up for the cost of including affordable units, they significantly offset the inherent costs and provide developers with enough of a carrot to make the acceptable profit margins still work. The bonus density is the incentive most taken advantage of by DC developers. Essentially, when you meet the criteria necessary for included affordable units you can build  20% more gross floor area (effectively more market rate units) of building than you would normally be limited to in that particular zone. This is huge. There are certain fixed and slow growing costs in building construction that have enormous potential for efficiencies of scale that bonus density allows for. Those elevators and shafts, those amenity spaces, your centralized mechanical equipment, the building's foundation and structure, your loading dock, the cost of rerouting existing off site utilities, etc etc are all either fixed costs or slow expanding costs that the ability to spread them over more units (revenue generating square footage) makes much more affordable. I've been a part of projects where this bonus density gained from including affordable units has actually made the building PROFITABLE based on the bonus density available. Additionally, developers have no requirement to make the ADUs the exact same as the market rate housing in their buildings, so they will almost always use cheaper finishes and appliances  in these units. Per square foot, the ADU is not costing the developer nearly as much as the market rate units.

So now the reputation that they are just mini section 8 housing projects in the middle of luxury apartments of condos that YOU are paying full price for and THEY are living high on the hog on your and the tax payers's dime. This is absolutely untrue and NIMBYism to the highest degree. ADUs are based on median income in the geographic area where the building is being constructed. You'll often here of families in DC that have an adjusted gross family income of under 20k. These people are not able to afford ADUs in buildings like Flats 130. The whole point of IZ is to try to allow working individuals or families the opportunity to live and benefit from communities with higher standards of living and perhaps be able to afford to live in the neighborhoods where they work. Often one of the biggest complaints and shortcomings of IZ is that it does not produce nearly enough affordable housing compared to what is being displaced by new luxury development. This is a very fair criticism. IZ is a small drop in the overall bucket of building livable, safe, and close knit communities for those with less means. What is not a valid criticism however is that there is inherent violence and crime caused by including these units, and this should either lead to their phasing out or special security measures to keep these areas quarantined. To be frank, this kind of talk offends me on a very deep level and speaks to a corrosive attitude amongst a certain subset of this subreddit and washington dc as a whole. There is no evidence whatsoever that residents of ADUs in new development are more prone to bringing a criminal or unsafe element into these new buildings and that fear speaks to a deeper class phobia amongst the people expressing those opinions. Developers and owners who I have sat with in meetings have expressed these types of fears to my face and it is disgusting, as are people on this subreddit who suggest separate doors, elevators, and security oversight. It is a shameful opinion that poor people are best left to their own devices in walled off enclaves, shuttled to shitty underperforming schools and given access to a fraction of social and community services those in other parts of DC are entitled to. It is so easy to demonize an entire group of people based on income by the way we read the crime blotter and start to work ourselves into a frenzy. 

Anyways, enough of me trying my best to explain IZ. Any more and I'll probably be accused of being a Bozzutto plant.

Pepper Spray or a firearm are not magical talismans that keep evil at bay.

You need the skillset to use the weapon.
Then you actually need the weapon.

If one of those components is missing, then you will not be successful at defending yourself. 

Mindset is the most important. If you are not willing to harm another person to defend yourself then the toolset or skillset doesn‚Äôt matter. The old shibboleth of ‚Äúthe attacker will just take it and use it against you‚Äù comes from this lack of mindset.

Tasers are hit or miss, quite literally, and if you have a stun gun you have to get up close and personal. Knives, brass knuckles, clubs, etc. are okay in a pinch, but unless you know what you‚Äôre doing you are probably just going to piss off your attacker.

Basic, common sense, methods are carrying a wallet with minimal information and cards in it. A DL, one credit card, and 80 to 100 bucks in cash is always a good way to go. Alternatively, you can carry a fake wallet with some older defunct gift cards, a bad ID, and 100 bucks in cash. Keep your real ID, a card, and a credit card in a money clip, or something that does print inside your pocket. The robber will gladly leave with the fake wallet showing 100 dollars in it. As for your phone, well, the robber will ask for your code. If you can set up a remote lockout that is best. Or just have a shitty phone like me and easily replace it later. As for making yourself a less attractive target, be beige, don‚Äôt wear fancy watches or jewelry, or fancy shoes and clothes. Keep alert and show you‚Äôre alert when on your own, or with friends. Look at people in the eye, let them know you see them. Even a simple glance. That sometimes can be enough to give the robber pause and find a simpler, less aware target. Like people have posted, they‚Äôre looking for people who are not paying attention to their surroundings, who they can stun and run.

If that‚Äôs correct, you are living along one of the most prominent fault lines of gentrification in the city. 

You have to your east a few historically black neighborhoods (which are still black) that were built on the banks of the Anacostia river explicitly because no white people wanted to live there as it was where the sewers all dumped into the river and essentially one big environmental hazard. 

These neighborhoods (Kingman Park, Langston, the part of Rosedale east of 15th street) are ‚Äúresistant‚Äù to gentrification to a certain degree for a few reasons: housing projects which are prominent and difficult for developers to build around, kingman park having the legal protection of being a historic neighborhood, and the lack of a metro stop nearby aside from stadium armory. 

But everything to the west of them, all the way up to 15th street has already been rapidly gentrifying to the point that the wealthier people are moving in faster than the poor people can move out. And the demand is still high in that area and will only grow with the addition of the C street bike lanes and depending on what they do with RFK.

Harnesses are not good either. They are good for dogs with small necks. Martingales are really the best collar, and you can get a shorter leash.

jiuidjl,137bmly,PolymathEquation,"I live here, and I'll put it to you like this:
If you've lived in a major city and are aware of the things to avoid, you'll be fine.

I've walked with my wife and infant at night without being harassed, but generally have a good idea of who or what to avoid. 

That being said,


If you're unfamiliar with city life, here are a few common tips:

Don't go walking in dark alleys at night. 

Don't confront groups of people. 

Don't walk alone in the dark with headphones. 

Don't walk around displaying wealth (expensive jewelry, goose coats, gucci purse) in impoverished neighborhoods. 

Avoid unnecessary eye contact.

Pay attention to your surroundings.

And, above all, trust your gut instincts and leave an area if you don't feel safe.



What we call ""instincts"" are often triggered by a person's micro observations. We hear things or see things that we fail to put much focus on, but part of our mind has combined to recognize as markers of potential threat.

The typical reactions for this feeling are:

-Hair on the back of your neck raising

-A feeling as though you're being watched.

-Sudden feeling of not being okay, a sense of dread.

-Unintentional clenching of muscles, often hands into fists, clenched jaw, but also shoulders, feet, stomach.

-Senses suddenly more acute. This is an adrenaline response. Your body is pushing out the fight/flight chemical. 

-A feeling like there's a heavy rock in your stomach, also called a pit in your stomach.


Again, I live here as a family man. I am rather risk-averse. 
Be smart, be safe, and you won't have to worry.

That could certainly be the case, but not stocking and staffing the store is a deliberate corporate policy that is enabling/creating the problem. Columbia Heights 20+ years ago wasn't a utopia and the store was able to open and deal with theft while overcharging for products. Due to increased competition, their profit margins are so thin now that they can no longer charge the absurd prices they could before and that's the real reason why they are neglecting and closing their retail stores. It's no longer a viable business model and they have been forced to try to pivot.

But that CVS has no real security. The worker (manager on duty at the time) at the store told me they aren't allowed to stop shoplifting or call the police.

This would have been impossible before (the store used to have serious security and at least 5-10x, maybe more, the employees it has now). What do you think is going to happen when a store has that policy and people are aware of it? Businesses have a responsibility to run their businesses in a safe and coherent manner in a community and CVS isn't doing that. 

I actually remember when that store and some of the other first chains moved into CH and one of the key negotiations with those businesses at the time was assurances that they would take measures to have a coherent security plan for the stores--both for customers and workers.

I'm actually shocked that anyone would defend the company. They overbuilt in the city during their boom time, and now they're paying the price for it. All of these chain-store closures correlate to businesses who have lost competitiveness to online shopping and profit margins due to higher rent and labor costs.

We have probably the normal amount of crime you could expect in a city, maybe even a bit less because we don't have a big metro stop / commercial area that attracts more foot traffic. There are a lot of cool families in the area, although they do tend to move as their kids reach school age which is a shame, probably my only big complaint.

He was quoted in a recent WaPo article saying that, for unexplained reasons, the Youth Act makes DC streets safer.  I would be willing to listen to arguments about how releasing criminals early does not necessarily make the streets more dangerous, but how could it possibly make them safer?

Also, there are in fact some relevant data about the violence interrupter programs.  Those programs started getting funded in 2018, and since then, violent crime has steadily increased year after year.  I'm not saying that that violence interrupter programs *caused* the increase, but they obviously did not prevent it.  Now, Charles Allen and the other proponents can argue, ""well, if we did not have violence interrupters hard at work on the streets, the increases in violent crime would be *even larger*.""",5,2021,10,2,1,"1, 3"

imahub1,x09jwk,adoxographyadlibitum,"Yeah, SF was a weird situation (former resident).  

The AG didn't really have time to implement a lot of reforms.  The people who supported the recall couldn't really pinpoint any decisions of his that would have contributed to an increase in violent crime.  One of the only progressive initiatives he got off the ground was opening investigations into Doordash and other delivery apps for wage theft.  

There was also massive funding for the recall from out of state donors, which is bizarre for the AG of a city with 800k people. $7.2m raised as of June '22.  Lots of it seems to have come from development corporations.  

SF still has 1/3 the murders of a city like Jacksonville with the same population, but what matters is people *feel* less safe.  Even if the stats are marginally higher than a few years ago, public safety is more of a vibe.  If your neighbor's house gets broken into, it doesn't matter what stats say about how common that actually is.  Add to that many SF residents, especially wealthier ones, are transplants from more suburban areas that weren't around when the city was more dangerous in the 90s.

The SFPD also clearly opposed Boudin (the recalled AG).  They declined to make a lot of drug arrests, and blamed the AG for it, when that was not his office's instruction.  

Tying this all together is the AG has kind of an infamous family.  It was pretty easy to paint him as a radical because his parents were eco-activists/terrorists in The Weathermen back in the 60s.  He also kind of bungled his defense by trying to tie the recall efforts to Trump, when it's clear they were just rich developers who want to get the police back to razing encampments of people with nowhere to live.",-5,2022,8,2,1,0

imbiq2h,x09jwk,AnonyJustAName,"No, read the article at link again re: carjacking.

It will be ""robbery"", with a much lower penalty.

""Robbery and Carjacking Penalties

The RCCA proposes creating three gradations of Robbery, depending on the level of bodily injury suffered by the victim, and the type of property that was involved. A robbery that did not result in serious or significant bodily injury, and where the property taken was valued at less than $5,000, would be categorized as Third Degree Robbery, with a statutory maximum of 2 years‚Äô incarceration. Committing this offense while armed with a firearm would be categorized as Enhanced Third Degree Robbery, with a statutory maximum of 4 years‚Äô incarceration, with a higher maximum penalty if the firearm actually caused bodily injury to the victim. The RCCA also proposes subsuming the offense of Carjacking into Robbery. Unarmed Carjacking would be categorized as Second Degree Robbery, with a statutory maximum of 4 years‚Äô incarceration, and Armed Carjacking would be categorized as Enhanced Second Degree Robbery, with a statutory maximum of 8 years‚Äô incarceration. See RCCA ¬ß 22A-2201.

While we could support reductions in the maximum penalties for these offenses, the proposed reductions are simply too great. The maximum penalty for Carjacking should recognize that Carjacking is akin to burglary in some ways, as it may involve a traumatic intrusion into a person‚Äôs personal and presumed secure space.\[2\] It also results in the loss of what is often a much more significant asset than is lost in another form of robbery. Further, the proposed maximum penalties for Robbery and Enhanced Robbery are insufficient to account for the harms that can be incurred in a robbery, particularly where the robbery is committed while armed with a dangerous weapon. For example, under the RCCA proposal, both a defendant who held a gun to a victim‚Äôs head and threatened to kill the victim in connection with a robbery and a defendant who fired a gun indiscriminately at a victim, but did not hit the victim because of bad aim, could each be sentenced to a maximum of 4 years‚Äô incarceration for that offense. A maximum possible sentence of 4 years‚Äô incarceration would be woefully inadequate for such conduct. Notably, the District‚Äôs Sentencing Guidelines categorize Robbery as a Group 6 offense‚Äîa person convicted of this offense with the lowest criminal history would face a guideline range of between 1.5 and 5 years; a person convicted of this offense with the highest criminal history would face a guideline range of 3.5 years or more in prison. The Guidelines categorize Armed Robbery as a Group 5 offense‚Äîa person convicted of this offense with the lowest criminal history would face a guideline range of between 3 and 7 years in prison; a person convicted of this offense with the highest criminal history would face a guideline range of 7 years or more in prison. The RCCA‚Äôs proposed departure is unwarranted.""

The carjacking legislation passed in 1993 which had very stiff penalties with NO AGE CARVEOUTS was very effective. But Charles Allen and the current Council will do away with the offense entirely.

Crime seemed to start taking a bad turn just prior to the pandemic but the pandemic put things on steroids and has not slowed down.  Throw in the cops seem content to sit in their cars and let whatever go out around them and yeah sure seems things have gotten worse.  

I think the huge difference is the random crime.  It used to seem that you had be looking for trouble or in the wrong place at the wrong time ‚Ä¶.. that seems to be way less the case now.

Many are not reporting crimes because they feel the city is already inundated, major crimes are not prosecuted, so why waste the time to report some petty theft.

ju4u0r8,15dsv71,addctd2badideas,"> the vast majority of property crime, while inconvenient and annoying, boils down to a deductible and a few minutes on the phone, for something that may happen to you once or twice in your life.

The thing is, when your house is broken into, you feel violated. It's a violent act to come into someone else's home, where they, in theory, should feel the most secure. Then if you're robbed or carjacked at gunpoint, it's DEFINITELY more than just a call to your insurance company. It's fucking traumatic and will require a LOT of time (and often therapy) to get over - if at all.

And then there's the *proximity* to crime. When someone is gunned down on your block, mere yards from your house, would you want to stay in the city? Especially if you have young children, your first instinct should be to flee the city and move to the suburbs. At least mine was. When a stray bullet goes into your neighbor's window, that's not normal. If you think it is or ""that's just city life,"" then you're living in a delusion.",51,2023,7,2,1,"1, 3"

Mentioning Biden's refusal to overturn it without mentioning a literal reelection campaign where he saw little reason to oppose it since DC will vote for him anyway is misleading (though mentioning that it's anti-democratic AF and makes him a hypocrite sadly never gets mentioned by crime trolls like you). Mentioning some Congressional Democrats support without mentioning *when* they supported it (aka, ""after Biden said he wasn't going to veto, so they had no reason to take a potentially hard vote"") is misleading.

So all in all, you were misleading. What facts did I get wrong, exactly?

Because the simple reality is that stopping a criminal code reform bill that would've added more crimes, allowed for simpler stacking, and simply would be a criminal code that was actually representative of DC (because the original code was passed by non-elected officials appointed by Congress) hasn't changed the course of the year we've had. It would've had zero effect on crime, yet misleading crime trolls like you would have us believe that carjackers are frequently getting 40 year prison sentences every day, and that having that sentence be lowered to the maximum that they actually end up receiving would lead us to pandemonium. 

So spare me the fallacy fallacy and the ""revisionist"" bullshit.

Is crime up in Admo if you look at it in a one year snapshot? Probably. If you go back 5 or 10 years though it‚Äôs far better. Crime in DC is not uniformly spread out and crime can be up in a relatively safe area (Admo) and it can still be safe, and safer than it was in years past. Crime can also be down in very unsafe neighborhoods and they can still be unsafe. 

Crime is more an emotional response/personal perspective issue. You obviously are not wrong in how you personally perceive it, and if you have only lived in Admo for 5 years your going off a lopsided snapshot due to COVID and the national crime trends. There have also been a string of high publicity incidents, which if they happened in other parts of the city probably wouldnt have gotten the media attention. Ward 1 and 2 (since Admo kinda straddles both) remain overall pretty safe areas. 

The concentration of crime has long been an issue in DC and as this highlights, has recently gotten far worse.

Biden spent the midterms campaigning on the idea that Republicans were against democracy. Which they are.

TL;DR There's a ton of changes happening around the WalMart building which may result in a lot of new people with disposable income walking around this part of town sooner and later.

Three brand new apartment buildings have been completed or will be completed along H St in addition to some Georgetown U grad student housing all within 2 blocks of the WalMart

Speaking of Georgetown, they just purchased that huge black building on Mass Ave across from their existing law school, and they are adding a new building on the other end of their campus. Rumor is that one of those will be home to their public policy school.

There is a Royal Sonesta Hotel replacing the old USCIS headquarters on Mass close to North Capitol. Looks on track to open this year 

Another hotel/apartment building is going up on 3rd and G St . A Holiday Inn Express just opened on 4th & K NW, and ground broke on a new apartment building across the street.

The new Capital Jewish Museum is set to open soon at 3rd & F st. NW

Not sure of the status of Capitol Crossing, but L'Ardente and Tatte Bakery are poppin. Bar Spero just opened and it looks like there's movement again in Love Makoto, the japanese food hall that was supposed to open last year.
