Only shopped at this location as a last resort a few times when nothing else nearby was open and it was somehow more unpleasant than other Walmarts.

I thought the area around the Walmart had been significantly built up with thousands of apartment units at this point. Probably conflating the location with other parts of NoMa.

I looked up some pictures of the space too per your comment about it being below grade. You're right, that's a really tough space.

This is such an interesting question to me because it's a question those who work in Real Estate have been trying to answer for a while. What replaces big box when they leave or downsize? The space itself is more suited for industrial warehousing or self-storage or data center type of use even (some old big box in NoVa has been converted to data centers) but the locations and zoning of the urban big box such as Macys on G Street makes that completely unviable. Obviously can't have ugly, dirty, freight truck oriented logistics facilities in the middle of downtown streets where people live/work.

You have any take on this? My only thoughts are self-storage, potentially medical office, and/or a creative retail solution like finding a discount gym could probably work. Obviously Douglass Development was able to transform the Woodies Building into Class A office & Retail by chopping the space up, so it can be done.

Having lived in another Bozzuto building, you could see the difference between a property they are investing in and one that's falling off.

Let's go down the list.  

> the police have decided it’s not worth pursuing the criminals

Obviously hyperbole but if you're gonna ask if anything you said was wrong you can start here.  

>you’re not allowed to complain about here  

4 to 6 of the current top posts in the sub are related to crime, and stories about [crime declining](https://www.axios.com/local/washington-dc/2023/01/05/violent-crime-stats-dc-2022) never get any attention here or anywhere else.  Leading to a [false perception](https://dcist.com/story/23/02/23/dc-crime-adams-morgan-safety/) that crime is increasing.  

>You’ll be called a racist and told it’s a victimless crime cus the only ones affected are the billion dollar corporations.

I looked through all the posts on crime at the top of the sub and literally no one said this.  However, comments *claiming* people say this or using similar strawmen are everywhere and heavily upvoted despite being low-effort, thoughtless, and blatantly incorrect.  It's almost as if there's some politics-driven narrative that trains people to all say the same shit regardless of how obviously incorrect it is.

>Meanwhile we’re supposed to pretend like it’s completely normal to spend 25 minutes in a store, doing multiple laps to find an associate just to buy a tube of toothpaste. 

This does not take anywhere close to 25 minutes.  If it takes 25 seconds you gotta work on your person-finding skills. And by the way, it is normal.

That said, for my entire life, this has been the pattern for the H Street Corridor, Trinidad and NY Ave area (obligatory “tf is a NoMa?”). Every 7-10 years there’s a burst of development in the area that gets certain types excited about the changes in the area, but the pendulum *always* swings back over there for some reason. I think this latest burst does still feel more sustainable (maybe bc of so many gov buildings in the area with long-term leases), but anybody who really knows the area or knows anything at all about its history isn’t particularly shocked by the uptick in crime that *seems* to be more prevalent in that section of the city. 

I remember moving back home after college and being shocked that my friend was having a birthday brunch on H Street bc in high school it was mostly just good for Murray’s lol but before that when I was younger, (and according to my older family a few times before that) they had tried to develop it into a U-Street like neighborhood, gained a little traction and failed.",24,2021,5,2,1,"1, 5"

Solution: active policing to establish a sense of looming punishment for both small and large crimes. Results in safer communities.

tl;dr: nobody knows exactly why there's a massive spike in violent crime in the last couple of years (hint: it's not the pandemic and it's not purely economic). But research  pretty firmly indicates that more police presence, more arrests, and more incarceration will result in less violent crime (i.e., precisely what led to reduced crime in 1990s and 2000s).

The standard of just letting people take over public space and do this type of stuff is a minor inconvenience when it’s just a few people, but it doesn’t take much for it to spiral out of control.

Keep in mind they don’t have as strict fire safety regulations there, often to preserve historic properties that would otherwise not pass code. We had rented our house for 2 years with no issues, but during the pandemic squatters started taking over the abandoned property next to us. First group was a couple shooting up heroin in the backyard and getting into physical altercations with each other. Awful. Even though it was under police jurisdiction as a condemned property, police could do little without hard evidence of physical abuse or admission which the female was reluctant to provide as if often the case. Eventually they moved on.

Next was a rotating group of pretty well behaved junkies. There was one guy who we caught peeping but we addressed this with the “leader” and they took care of it. Knowing the police couldn’t help, we felt better about the situation since at least they seemed to want to keep a low profile and weren’t getting into fights with each other or being loud.

Fast forward a month and we wake up at 4am to the abandoned property completely ablaze. Either crack lighters in a tinderbox house, or an indoor fire to keep warm on the first really cold night of the year. Fire reached and destroyed our home as well.

The great thing about NGOs is they’re often more efficient than government, because all the money they raise goes to addressing a specific issue directly.

I'm going to need to see the impact report that you're sourcing this from. Some NGOs are efficient, but a lot are not, have ulterior motives (e.g. religious NGOs), and actually rely on exploitative labor practices to get anything done. There is also a problem of the redoubling of efforts between many small NGOs attacking the same problem, which depletes public resources without allowing any one organization to achieve the critical mass necessary to finance bigger, structural programming. Sustainability is often an issue: NGOs can fail or face a fundraising issue, and sometimes nobody is left to continue their programs. And because of the short funding cycles of many NGOs (e.g. some grants are annual or less), the issue of continuation of programming can actually loom rather large. 

> That’s why, personally, I’m a big advocate for cutting taxation + wasteful spending and encouraging individuals to step up to the plate, work together, and help their neighbor.

So you're a libertarian. I don't really get it tbh. Government is perfectly capable of handling the tasks that governments are supposed to handle, as long as the citizenry holds it accountable. Replacing government with smaller organizations is less efficient, not more. It means you're wasting more money and effort on supporting the fixed costs of running many small businesses, therefore less money goes to beneficiaries.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/howardhusock/2014/04/10/lesson-for-april-15-why-government-cant-replace-charity/amp/

Two anecdotal experiences:
1. In the county I’ve spent most of my life in, part of the county is a food desert and perpetually poor. Attempts at economic development have mostly failed, and since the majority of the county is upper middle class or extremely wealthy there’s not much interest in continuing it further. Most of these people are unwilling to deal with higher taxes, and because it’s a small county without much economic importance the state government is also unwilling to invest in it. The poorest locals are served mostly by a food pantry, which receives heavy support from local grocery stores as well as donations from the wealthy community surrounding it (be it for tax write offs, looking good, genuine altruism, or a mix of the three). Private charity has shown itself to be much more effective than government here, and is routinely subsidized by the county for that very reason: it would be much more expensive for the government to duplicate their effort than it would be to support the charity.

2. When the storms hit earlier this year, substantial portions of Buckingham, Nottoway, and Dinwiddie County lost power and water for almost two weeks. The state refused to activate the Guard despite declaring a local emergency, and the Department of Emergency Management did not mobilize humanitarian support. Private citizens from across the state raised several thousand dollars and wound up supporting just over 500 families with propane, heaters, firewood, blankets, winter clothing, water, and food until power and water came back on.",1,2021,5,2,1,0

981,jc4rrbd,11qqlj1,VoodooGirl47,"I find it funny that people think older buildings aren't clean. As long as it's a good building, then it's just as clean if not cleaner than a new building. New buildings have tons of space that people get filthy each day. The walls are thin, everything is built really cheaply unless you are paying like $4000+ for a 1 bedroom. Navy Yard is just like NoMa etc with a bunch of newer buildings that are all roughly the same price but it's actually more expensive than NoMa when looking at sq ft to price.

I prefer to live in older buildings because they have much better soundproofing, I legit only hear occasional things dropped on the floor above me or someone walking down the hallway while talking and only immediately in front of my door. I get safer neighborhoods, lower rents, many include all utilities, and RENT CONTROL. I don't need to live in a 8-12 floor building where I pay $2400 for a tiny one bedroom and then rent goes up 15+% and I have to sign another lease (month to month is wonderful after the 1st year). Plus noisy neighbors. No thanks.

Also wondering how Dupont isn't affordable? The reason that prices do start to go up in the spring for some buildings is because there are so few vacancies and everyone wants to live there, plus it's probably rent controlled and includes utilities.

I've watched the prices for units in NoMa and Navy Yard (which is also what people generally include Capital Riverfront as part of) decline over the past few months because there are so many vacancies and it's really not a great deal once you include like $200-300+ extra costs for utilities and the $500 amenity fee etc.",12,2023,3,2,1,0

There have been several shootings and a carjacking in broad daylight right near Illume so far this year. My partner moved to Navy Yard from NYC and IMO it’s not that there’s more crime here than NYC, but it feels more unpredictable and brazen. I’m not trying to scare you, there’s crime everywhere in DC so there will be something no matter where you end up. Just don’t be surprised when it happens. Be alert and you’ll be fine. 

The waterfront is a nice place to walk and hang out on a sunny day. A handful of good restaurants but otherwise mostly mediocre bars and eats that cater to the sports and concert crowd IMO. If you like concerts it’s awesome being able to walk to one at Nats Park. My overall view of Navy Yard is that a lot of the restaurants, bars, and apartment buildings are facades - they look fancy and brand new and alluring on the outside, but what you end up getting is a toss up. Mediocre food, shitty apartment construction, bad management. Some people disagree; to each their own. 

If you just want to experience a luxury apartment within your budget, north Arlington honestly sounds better - tons of parks and trails, close to the water, easy commute to GW on the orange line, lots of good little restaurants for takeout, and much safer.

Close to silver spring, easy access to NoMa and union station to take train out of city. Lots of new development and housing finally coming to market in and near the Parks at Walter Reed too.

DuPont can be affordable but there a fewer big apartment buildings, a lot more condos for rent. There are deals, just take work and luck to find. Living a bit farther out in Cleveland park might have some options and is more central.

Cons: very much a car zone to the point where they rarely yield to pedestrians and they do not respect you
Other things to note: very much a dog community (if you aren’t a dog person you might not like all the dogs around including the dog poo etc) and you will constantly have a big sports and bar scene atmosphere in the summer (if you aren’t a sports person or someone who can ignore big crowded streets it might not be for you), not a lot of parks/green areas (there are some and trails but they are more urbans than your traditional parks)

It's not the same, much closer and easier to cross the river overall. You can walk from Rosslyn to Georgetown in under a mile. There's some bridge traffic during rush hour but nowhere close to NYC.

Navy  Yard to Foggy Bottom is 22 mins on metro and you have to switch lines (and the DC metro is not like the NYC subway in terms of consistency).

1219,jc521rw,11qqlj1,LadyHalfNHalf,"I lived on the terrace level in 1hundred and the communal bathroom routinely overflowed into the hall and into some units (not mine). This happened several times until I finally went directly to their corporate office and then they started locking the bathroom (apparently someone was putting stuff in the toilet to intentionally flood it?).

Locking the bathroom stopped the flooding but it was a whole mess trying to get them to care that sewage water was soaking the carpet once a week!

The apartments look nice, cabinets are very cheap and will peel. My heat was consistently broken and had to be put on emergency heat (it was a whole thing getting them to reimburse me for super high electric bills I received being on emergency heat).

Wi-Fi in the gym never worked and there was no cell service in there. Treads and elliptical were broken/in bad shape and never fixed despite multiple requests. 

Also, and this may not be an issue for you, but the construction and lack of natural light from all the tall buildings really got to me. My two big tips are 1. Get an apartment with natural light and 2. Don’t live near major construction (hard in DC!).

Also, living right next to the highway means all that air you breathe with be less than fresh. My patio table was caked in black dust one day after cleaning. 

That being said, I have a friend who has lived in 70 for 5+ years in different units and loves it. Also everyone I met there worked for the democrats, but then again I didn’t meet too many people bc it was still deep Covid!

I think if my friends lived in Navy Yard, I would have enjoyed it a lot more. It definitely has a city feel, just not that quintessential DC feel I think a lot of us enjoy. 

I was actually a little nervous to move to a true DC neighborhood which felt too different from what I was used to and Navy Yard felt more familiar (reminded me of Downtown Jersey city).

After a year, I was more familiar with the city and spots that I actually liked to hang out in, so I moved to NW near my friends and I’m much happier. The one thing I do miss is being able to walk to the mall and the water. That was super nice.

I will say the sidewalk closing always kinda bothered me.

DDOT stands by the closure of the sidewalk because Park Van Ness's construction includes a parking garage that will exist underneath where the sidewalk is and thus providing support and structural integrity to the sidewalk. While under construction, because the garage wasn't there to completely support the weight of the sidewalk, the sidewalk had to close, or else would collapse under the weight of pedestrians.

These businesses were mostly corner stores and liquor stores, and had a reputation for charging high prices for low quality products. Even to this day if you go EOTR many if not most liquor stores, corner stores, and carryouts are owned and operated by Asian people.

2) Murdering people and using threats or violence to perpetuate a system of race based authority and rule.  Jim Crowe south from the end of the civil war until the 1970s.

3) Systemically denying a race of people civil rights and implementing second class citizenship supported by the government.  Same as #2, but arguably a significant issue up until the early 1990s and lingering to this day.

4) Individual cases of racist violence not supported by the govt.  2009 Charleston mass shooting.

1515,hdyxttm,pteigg,XComThrowawayAcct,"*This is my entirely subjective analysis. YMMV.*

There have always been racists, white supremacists, and jerkwads who see “Black” as synonymous with “criminal,” “violent,” and “delinquent.” There are also lots of soft-racists who repeat these memes thoughtlessly.

An example: my own mom once repeated the theory to me that young Black people wear baggy pants because they get ill-fitting clothes as hand-me-downs from imprisoned relatives. I suggested that, instead, it could be that skateboarding and biking often require loose-fitting clothes and that this developed into an exaggerated style among youth in urban areas where those sports are most popular. It just hadn’t occurred to her to consider an explanation that wasn’t connected to criminality.

The Internet makes it possible to achieve efficiency in racist commentary we once only dreamed of! You don’t have to meet in person to share your off-color joke. It’s mostly anonymous so even if someone calls you out, no one will ever really know it’s you. And lastly, social media platforms like Reddit thrive on the accessibility. I can wander about posting whatever nonsense I want in any community I want. While this results in a lot of flexibility and creativity, racist white-supremacist jerkwads use this technological advantage to their benefit, too — just like their predecessors who used home printing systems to organize pamphlet campaigns.

I’m not going to suggest that sometimes their activities don’t truly become criminal terrorism that requires law enforcement to intervene. I do want to suggest that mostly it’s a free speech problem and that the best solution to *bad* speech is *more* speech.

I also want to say that, in my opinion, this is ultimately a test of community values. To win — to beat back that shitty community of bigots and their brood of thoughtless hangers-on — we have to build a better community, one that expressly and intentionally embraces values that are more constructive and more inclusive than theirs. It’s hard — community organizing always is — because it will involve lots of compromises, lots of questionable edge cases, lots of bad jokes and lukewarm takes, but if we are committed to the values — construction and inclusion — then we’ll stick to the path and achieve the goal, together.",4,2021,9,2,1,0

DC made enormous strides in addressing its crippling crime problem (Murder Capital in the 1990s) and had a low of 85 homicides in 2012. This year will surpass 200. If it’s far right to say this is an issue for the city and its livability, then fine far right. But as someone who has only voted democratic it is a major quality of life issue and impediment to business. For me the biggest issue is the trend and not seeing clearly the policies and actions taken over the past 5 years have made it worse, if it doesn’t turn around it could be a crime-infested war zone, where right now it’s just a concerning trend that keeps getting closer and closer to home.

One of those safer cities includes Chicago, which TBF was always about average and only portrayed in the media as a war zone to smear Obama. I feel like most people choose to live in DC for other reasons knowing that, not deny reality. It really can happen anywhere except perhaps Palisades. If you value safety above all, move to New York, where you'll pay more to live in a more sterile gentrified area with $8 hot dogs. But it's not like the part of Queens or the Bronx you'll be able to afford for DC money is all that much safer than DC. It's not a warzone, it's not an especially dangerous or safe city, but you do have to be smart and be aware that there is a risk. Is that risk worth it, given how low your odds still are as long as you're not out in stupid places at stupid times of the night, and how incredibly boring zero-crime McLean is? I'd say so.

DC in the late 80s through the late 90s was awful. It drastically improved through ~2012 / 2013 and now has spent the better part of a decade receding. 

This despite the fact that the bulk of the new population DC has attracted over the past two decades are wealthy, educated young folk.

You can do a lot of political damage without ever flipping someone's vote. Tarnishing a candidate or a party can turn volunteers and donors into just voters. Increasing buy-in about primaries being rigged or ""both sides being the same"" can reduce the frequency that people vote. And, yes, there are still a good number of moderates who, in any election that doesn't involve Donald Trump, are open to voting across party lines.

These subtle shifts can also play out in the form of people posting less positive stuff (promoting democracy, civic duty, trust, etc.) and more negative content (apathy, divisiveness, etc.) on social media, which can contribute to more people in their network moving closer to these ideals OR can create discord and help isolate people from their longstanding peers due to growing political differences.",10,2021,9,2,1,0

The fact that you quoted the number of subscribers shows your misunderstanding. Lots of people can like a popular figure’s word salad, it doesn’t make what they have to say worthwhile. People eat up Deepak Chopra’s drivel, but it’s literally meaningless. Whereas very few people read and understand most of what’s published in PNAS, but those articles describe truths of the natural world. 

Much of what Peterson says is the same as Chopra’s bullshit, and people like you eat it up. Lobsters don’t have anything to do with human behavior, and what he says about lobsters is wrong anyway. He may have some expertise in clinical psychology (even that is dubious considering his former colleagues wouldn’t support tenure for him if they had known more about his views when he was under consideration). 

His conclusions about hierarchy, the role of women in society, transgender issues, are all without a basis in reality. 

If you like him because you need someone to tell you to clean your room, fine, but he’s not special in that regard. You can find a million self-help books that provide non-evidence based ways to get your life together. Hell, you can find a dom who will help you with that, and probably give you a more fulfilling relationship to boot. 

But to think that Peterson has any more than authority than the glorified self help charlatan he is is totally wrong.",2,2021,9,2,1,0

1776,he40ozm,pteigg,MinecartHalp,"Everything you said boils down to “I’ve found a self-help book that works for me.”

That’s fine, I guess, but you can’t hold Peterson’s work out to be more than self help—and you absolutely shouldn’t take his ability to write a self help book as meaning that he has anything valuable to say about the rest of the world. I could say the same thing about Marie Kondo.  

Again, just because people buy into his bullshit, doesn’t mean it’s worthwhile or good for society. Think about Deepak Chopra. He was on the best seller list, and probably some people found a modicum of inner peace by visualizing their “quantum self”. Fine, good for them I guess. But there are larger harms associated with Chopra purveying pseudoscience bullshit. Some of these people will think that they can affect “quantum states” with their mind, some will forgo medical treatment for curable diseases. 

Peterson is the same. He dresses up his self-help as universal truths, which can be very dangerous if taken to their ultimate conclusion. It’s fine if all you use his advice for is helping you get your life together—many people use religion beneficially for the same purpose. But when you take it beyond self-help and use him to reinforce your own conservative (e.g. patriarchal) views, that’s unequivocally negative when these opinions conflict with reality. Given your other comments on crime and women, I’d say you fall into this category. 

This is exactly why Peterson’s oeuvre is terrible for society—it preys on people who would benefit from help (other self help books, therapy, a life coach), and reinforces their regressive societal views if they have them, or worse, generates them in someone who otherwise didn’t have them. 

>	Therein lies another problem with your argument: It's purely political.

You’re not using the word, “political”, correctly here. My argument is about truth and bullshit, not politics. (No doubt Peterson would vote for the CPs, and I’d vote NDP probably if I were Canadian, but this isn’t about *politics*, and these aren’t my *political* opinions.) This is about how Peterson misinforms, distorts, or lies about the reality of the human condition.

It seems like you’re placing great weight on his academic work and educational background. You’re naive to think that his academic credentials give him expertise on any issue outside of his immediate specialty. But he probably thinks it does, which is why much of what he says about the motivations of women or about social issues is absolute bullshit. You can’t seriously think that you’re experiencing his academic work when he tells you to clean your room. 

(Regarding McGill, Harvard, and UofT, I think everyone who’s gone to a top university/ivy understands that the students and professors are just as flawed as everyone else. I can recognize the legitimate contributions of these universities, while keeping in mind that they sometime produce bad results, as with the case of Peterson or Dershowitz.)

If you want a thorough dissection of Peterson’s bullshit, this is a good start, though I doubt you’ll read it. https://merionwest.com/2019/12/10/standing-by-our-criticisms-of-jordan-peterson/


>	You can make these weak attempts to delegitimize his career and work. None of that matters. At the end of the day, he's helping millions of people improve their lives while you wallow away miserably possessed by a radical political ideology.

See, it does matter because people will be influenced by him beyond his trite self-help points and tricked into believing false things about the world, society, and human nature. You may be a good example of this if you can’t see him for what he is. Try picking up a self-help book that’s a little less “political”. (Sarcasm by the way.)

Separately, the amount of effort you’ve put into this conversation sure seems like you’re trying to prove something to yourself. Again, it’s okay if you find Peterson’s bland truisms helpful, but don’t shy away from larger criticisms of his “philosophy”.",3,2021,9,2,1,0
1777,he4wof2,pteigg,MinecartHalp,"I’m sad that your dismal reading comprehension and argumentation skills are making this so hard for you. 

I mentioned political parties to show this wasn’t about politics. Not hypocrisy, just something you missed. 

I don’t think I can provide any more examples that will get you to understand that someone’s popularity does not equate to their value. Similarly, I can’t make you understand that his academic credentials aren’t evidence for the truth (or even coherence) of his statements. (Has he ever given you a definition of post modern neo Marxism? No. It’s just a boogeyman.)

Finally, I’d encourage you to reconsider your understanding of and relationship to “politics” and “political ideology”. We’re not discussing politics here (and I don’t think Peterson discusses politics much at all). This has nothing to do with politics or a political ideology, and your incorrect use of those terms to dismiss me is unfortunate. If you think that every person who see the world as is it and wants to change it to make it a better place is engaged in (dirty) politics, that’s a sad way to live. These issues transcend political parties and candidates. I’m arguing with you because I care about your mental and physical health, and I don’t want you believe that there is a baby-eating cabal or that ivermectin cures covid, if that’s what Peterson tells you.

No, having lived or worked in several other major cities considerably bigger than DC including outside the country (NYC, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Harbin) I can confirm that this is not typical for being in a highly popular, ""normal"" part of town in a city. 


It is however not uncommon for living in DC, depending where you are.


How one reacts to this kind of thing being a nontrivial possibility in many parts of town is different for everyone. I take sensible precautions and use street sense where I live (NoMa); that didn't deter the scraggly guy passing me on a bike who decided he wanted to follow me and then chase me with a knife screaming at me all the way. But my day to day is calm and I don't feel like I need to be on super high alert, just aware of my surroundings, and I refuse to live in fear.

I am a dude in the same area in DC. I carry a knife, and if a bum tried that with me, I'd use it. So that is what I encourage--use that deterrent once it passes into actual physical contact.  
  
The NW passage def seems way safer than other parts of town. But isn't without the bums and troublesome who take busses or whatever up. I saw a guy walking up Connecticut, north of DuPont, threatening to hit people if they didn't give him money, including women. Total predator.

So for this sentence, they're saying the kids allegedly kicked and stomped him. Considering later in the article they talk about the video footage seen, they're likely piecing it together from that.

Second, one day ago she stated the Capitol reopening to tours is “too slow” - despite the fact the Capitol police are down more than 400 officers and can’t provide adequate safety - to say nothing about Covid: https://norton.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/norton-says-phased-reopening-of-capitol-is-too-slow

Third, here are all the bills she’s written this Congress. What’s noticeable is how few cosponsors she has - zero on the vast majority. As a jaded staffer, I’m not critiquing her for not passing laws or having a ton of support - but no support? None? It’s because she does slap dash, piss poor policy that not even your most liberal members touch. Effective lawmakers are able to convince some of their colleagues to support their ideas, surely. https://www.congress.gov/quick-search/legislation?wordsPhrases=&wordVariants=on&congressGroups%5B%5D=0&congresses%5B%5D=117&legislationNumbers=&legislativeAction=&sponsor=on&representative=N000147&senator=

You can also see EHN has essentially three policy buckets - bills about more benefits for DC residents (great but also that’s her job), liberal policy she can’t get anyone to support, and bills about this or that museum or memorial. I’m not seeing “ideas” here - I’m seeing her just throwing spaghetti at the wall. 

EHN is on the Oversight Committee and the Transportation committee. These are not “powerful” committees like Ways & Means or Energy & Commerce. You can make the argument for Oversight but I’ll rebut by saying their major piece of legislation has been about the post office (while needed, not powerful.)

And her chair on Transportation subcommittee- everyone knows DeFazio runs that committee in full. There’s no real power there. 

EHN just votes with Democrats. Anyone the district elects is going to have the exact same record. She, in theory, could raise more hell by not being a rubber stamp Dem in committee - but she’s literally never done that.

Most EHN supporters parrot her line about being rated as one of the most effective lawmakers as rated by the Center for Effective Lawmaking which uses really just one measure of success - how many bills did you support that have passed into law? 

EHN is number one because she signs onto a large, large majority of bills in Congress. Right now, she’s signed onto nearly 1500 bills. 

For context here’s how many other “famous” members have signed onto: Jayapal - 514. Sean Patrick Maloney - 230. Katie Porter - 382. Raskin - 621. Tlaib-524. I can’t find anyone who is even close to 1500. This works out to be approx 3 bills every day she signs onto. Effective? Or just slapping her name onto everything?

You need to be willing to shoot, in an instant's notice, possibly with little information (e.g. not knowing if the other person is armed, not knowing if they're a minor). You need to be willing to shoot to kill. You need to be able to not hesitate. And that's all assuming you're willing to carry a loaded gun, and that you have no other safety risks (like a small child) that make an unlocked gun a huge safety issue. And even then, a gun doesn't work for every situation-- if your gun is in a holster and someone already has a knife out, you simply don't have time to shoot them. It needs to be the exact right situation for you to 'win', it's not a guaranteed answer to prevent being stabbed.

If someone doesn't fit all the above, a gun makes things worse. If you hesitate, you may have just given the bad guy the gun-- especially if you're a small person and it's easy to take off you.
