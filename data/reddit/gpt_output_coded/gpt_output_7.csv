>Abstract

>Noise is unwanted and/or harmful sound, first recognized as a public health hazard in 1968. The Noise Control Act of 1972 declared that ‚Äúit is the policy of the United States to promote an environment for all Americans free from noise that jeopardizes their health or welfare.‚Äù The promise of that legislation remains unfulfilled 50 years later. Human exposure to harmful noise levels is widespread. Major sources include transportation, military aircraft and combat operations, noisy recreational vehicles, industrial machinery, recreational and leisure activities, outdoor power equipment, consumer products, and, possibly, wind turbines. Loud noise causes hearing loss and tinnitus and can contribute to non-auditory health problems. Chronic noise, even at low levels, can cause annoyance, sleep disruption, and stress that contribute to cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, metabolic disturbances, exacerbation of psychological disorders, and premature mortality. Noise interferes with cognition and learning, contributes to behavior problems, and reduces achievement and productivity. The health of more than 100 million Americans is at risk, with children among the most vulnerable. Noise-related costs range in the hundreds of billions of dollars per year. Yet, the United States has no federal standards for non-occupational noise exposure. Federal standards for occupational noise exposure from the 1970s address only hearing loss as an adverse health effect and do not apply to all workers (e.g., those in agriculture and construction). Calls for action have gone largely unheeded.",24,2022,3,2,1,0

236,i1vkvjd,tkyf41,saltyjohnson,"I agree with you generally, except FAA regs tend to avoid the word ""shall"" when it comes to dictating how a pilot operates their aircraft. FAA regs are very clear that the [pilot in command is the final authority as to the operation of their aircraft](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-91#p-91.3(a)). Even if a pilot deviates from a direct instruction from ATC, the only thing that the pilot ""shall"" do is notify ATC of the deviation and their next intentions as soon as possible. That's not to say that there won't be disciplinary actions taken against the pilot if an investigation finds that the deviation wasn't prudent, but that stuff waits until the pilot is on the ground so they can focus on operating their aircraft.

Thus, ""expected to"" is nearly equivalent to the word ""shall"" except that it leaves the window open for the pilot to deviate if they feel it's necessary. ""Expected to"" means that if ATC clears you to operate along a given route and does not state a specific altitude, you are cleared to operate at the maximum altitude charted. Again, if the pilot feels they must deviate for some reason, they are within their rights to do so. ""Shall"" would be more appropriate in the case of ""A pilot shall not enter prohibited area P-56"" because if you violate that direction, you're liable to be subject to lethal force. However, 14 CFR 73 still doesn't even say ""shall not"", rather sticking with what I'd think to be less severe [""you may not""](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-E/part-73/subpart-C/section-73.83) language.",4,2022,3,2,1,0

This is how the inner city urban death spiral began in the 1970s: crime caused people to leave the inner city, the city responded to less tax revenue by cutting police, which meant more criminals got free reign, which pushed more people out. Rinse and repeat.

We included some of your comments in this story. Here's a little preview of our list, written by Sophia Solano:***

Perhaps more than anything else in this fractured world, pizza is a point of consensus. It‚Äôs perfect for a kid‚Äôs birthday bash or an on-the-go lunch between calls, as well-suited to grace a silver platter at a fancy cocktail party as it is plopped on a paper towel for a whirl in the microwave. Everyone, it seems, can agree on pizza.

Unless you live in D.C.

Around here, pizza is very, very divisive.

Our city ‚Äî littered with New York and Midwestern transplants who have strong opinions on what makes a respectable pie ‚Äî has never gained a reputation as a great pizza town. While other cities get entire styles named in their honor, we get the crumbs.

Despite all that, there is truly great pizza in the DMV ‚Äî if you know where to look. We set out on a journey to find it, with our readers at the wheel.

What follows is a list of the best pizza joints in the Washington area, based on the opinions that matter most: those of our readers. Next time you‚Äôre hungry for pizza, seek out one of these shops. Their pies are as delicious as they come; we‚Äôre sure you‚Äôll agree.

***20: We, the Pizza***

The original Capitol Hill shop, frequented by school and tour groups, has grown to include We, the Pizza locations as near as Arlington and as far as Clearwater Beach, Fla. In addition to dozens of dining options (including a divisive honey ham and pineapple pie), the sodas are crafted with homemade syrups, and the Ballston location offers gelato shakes.

‚ÄúWe The Pizza is my favorite,‚Äù wrote one Reddit user. ‚ÄúTheir Ultimate Cheese \[tomato sauce, fontina, taleggio and mozzarella\] with the pesto oil drizzle makes my heart all a-flutter.‚Äù

***19: Jumbo Slice Pizza Mart***

There‚Äôs a misconception among the young and, well, drunk that ‚Äújumbo slice‚Äù refers to any of the several pizza joints dotting the streets of Adams Morgan after midnight on a weekend. It‚Äôs no wonder ‚Äî the term even has its own Wikipedia page. But only one restaurant, if you‚Äôre kind enough to call it so, actually holds the name ‚ÄúJumbo Slice.‚Äù Whether our polled readers referred to that stop or its greasily delicious posers remains a mystery. Even those who jumped into a discussion on the best Washington pizza expressed some ambiguity: ‚ÄúI think Jumbo Slice, right?‚Äù wrote a Reddit user who asked to be identified as Mike D. ‚ÄúOr is it just because it‚Äôs usually 2 a.m. when I‚Äôm eating it? I don‚Äôt really know.‚Äù

***18: Della Barba***

Most pizzerias stick to making just one or two styles of pie. But Della Barba, a former Union Kitchen start-up, proves that more options does not mean less attention to detail. Founder (and former defense attorney) Joey Barber offers four types of pies in the styles native to Detroit, New York, Chicago and your own oven, otherwise known as ‚Äúnonna‚Äù or ‚Äúgrandma-style.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt sleep on the nonna crust,‚Äù wrote Post reader Karen Wilson Roman. ‚ÄúBut all the crusts are delicious.‚Äù

2. Omission of Red Light (over Emmy Squared) for their Detroit Style pizza is a subjective borderline objective mistake.

I think the main issue with DC bagels is that they are often too white in appearance (whether that is them being under baked or not boiled long enough, IDK).\* Other minor differences I've noticed is that maybe ours are too dry as dough - the best NYC bagels I've had are still very good untoasted b/c the interior is moist and plump. The latter is maybe the only other difference I've noticed - some of our bagels are somewhat flat and look like there's a combination of too little dough and/or not enough leavening. People there also think the specific water they use is a big deal, but my palate isn't sensitive enough to detect that subtle of a difference.

\*Exception here is maybe Bagel Uprising in Del Ray, which has more like a bread crust exterior, but that's also different from what I'm talking about.

I had a similar incident when a man started to speed walk down the escalator to stand just right beside me. He then tried to raise his arm in front of me, holding a bag of some sort in his hand. When I noticed this I took a quick look back only to see him staring at me without saying a single word. Creepy as fuck.

I'm sure now that it's probably a case of mental illness, and really god knows what he would've done if I waited any longer. I threw away all pretext of civility and just booked it down the escalator and reported him to the first station agent I saw. The guy then finally started talking and raised a huge attitude about ""whatever the hell"" I had told the station agent. 

I managed to slip away as the station agent tried to calm down the man in order to defuse the situation, but it was very disturbing.

Regardless, the person who scratched the car showed lack of respect for another persons property. Why not just leave a note venting whatever they have to say instead of etching in their car?

What ProTimFanning said is exactly what I was going to say to your question. With body panels being made out of fiberglass, aluminum, and carbon fiber (such as Z06) it is a much tougher process to correct dents and scratches. Sometimes when dealing with things like carbon fiber it just is not fixable.  Also, nowadays most body shops just replace the whole body panel instead of trying to do paint correction for deep scratches to bare metal or really bad dents.

If you want to learn more about the process of fixing a keyed car this video is very in depth and good. If you don't watch the whole video the first two mins should give you an idea the labor intensive process of fixing something like this.

I don't know about you, but if I were a lawyer in the antitrust division, and we were pursuing a lawsuit against the alma mater that I owed a few grand in student loans to, I wouldn't hesitate to bring the hammer down. Of course, I doubt my boss or bosses' boss would care. And given ethical rules, I'd expect that if my son went to a university we were targeting, I wouldn't be placed on that case. 
4. This doesn't mean that universities don't know how to protect themselves, or that they don't have powerful lobbyists. I think the basic point that elite universities are well-connected and resourced, and that helps protect them is a good one. But I think you can make that point without resorting to sweeping generalizations and untrue claims. My hope is that this pushback lets you strengthen your point in future, and helps sharpen the case against the kind of behavior these schools are being sued over.",6,2022,1,2,1,0
1360,hsac1iv,s1dcqo,superdookietoiletexp,"I would be interested in seeing it play out. There is a very cosy relationship between the upper echelons of the US government and elite universities, particularly the policy schools that routinely hand out sinecures to newly unemployed politicians and their advisors between cycles. Whether that affects decisions made at DoJ is a moot point, I agree. The lobbying is probably more of a factor; another perhaps even more powerful is the role that HYPS et al. (and their reputation) serve in the projection of American soft power. Ultimately, it would be a very brave prosecutor in any administration other than Trump's that decided to take down their false claims to some meritocratic ideal.

> ""We feel that we ... have been absolutely abandoned by the city,"" McDonnell had written in his email. ""The crime and safety issues in that neighborhood are out of control.""
***
> In the original email, McDonnell detailed how his employees had been punched, pepper sprayed, had guns and knives pulled on them, spit on, and had to watch as ""customers have literally tried to kill each other."" He added that one of their employee's sons, who worked nearby, was robbed and murdered ‚Äì leaving his team distraught about the loss and about the situation in the neighborhood.

> ""All of the above needs to be understood in the context of the lack of police presence. There is none,"" McDonnell wrote. ""Once upon a time there was. 911 calls, if they come at all, take 15-20 minutes. When they do arrive, it seems as if they feel they can‚Äôt do anything.""

After WUSA9 found out about this and contacted the management, the management released a public letter saying it was happy with how it's addressing this. In the best case scenario, crime was actually terrible but Clyde's is genuinely happy with the efforts to address that. In the worst, the private communication is how Clyde's actually feels, and the statement of praise that was released immediately after the September letter was a face saving measure (perhaps not to upset the government, perhaps not to scare away patrons). If you're going by the idea that we can't trust what corporations are saying publicly, as it's just a way for them to get public opinion to go in the direction they want, I'm not sure why you'd trust the public letter over the private communication.

This doesn‚Äôt specify an intended neck touch, but instead, any touch of the neck inducing pressure on them with no measure of degree.

The current owner, a speculator, probably snatched this house up for, maybe, $100 grand and hasn't looked at it since.  It's in a not-bad neighborhood, just off S. Dakota Ave., 3 blocks from RI Ave.  It's on a huge lot. It has the potential for adding up and out. The owner is obviously open to offers but Zillow says the payments on the asking price would run $2,300 a month for a two bedroom, two bath house. If it was pretty that would be an attractive purchase for a rental. Except it's not pretty. But I don't see deterioration, just, so far, neglect.

The tipping factor is, of course, the down payment. For the sake of argument lets say the seller will take $400 grand. If so, there's your 20%, on paper, down payment.

If the current market could be considered constant this might be a good investment at $400 grand. But, in my opinion, it's not. The entire area is in a bubble. However, if I had bought it at $100 I'd feel safe as, well, houses.",2,2022,3,2,1,"1, 6"

In the 1950s, the farm around them sold and was developed into a post-war suburban neighborhood, with the standard quarter acre lots. They were smack dab in the middle of where the development wanted to build a road, but they refused, and so one of our main neighborhood streets abruptly ended at the edge of of their property, now heavily wooded, and containing two houses. 

By the late 1980s, the neighborhood started to be gentrified, and as the homes sold off, were razed to the ground and McMansions put in their place. Now about half my old neighborhood are huge homes that are built almost right up to the property line with barely any yard space to speak of. My school chum's parents eventually sold off the property they lived on for some ungodly amount of money based on property alone.  I think several million per acre.

In terms of safety you will be fine unless you decide to get drunk and go wander the back streets flashing $100 bills.

So, yeah there is stuff to do nearby but it isn't very unique to DC outside from the clientele. The baseball stadium is there so you could watch the Nats season continue to go down the tubes in one of the better MLB parks. In terms of more interesting food I'd check out Eastern Market which is not far away. Just about any other part of town is a 15-30 minute metro/uber away, you aren't staying in outer Mongolia. The other hotel options aren't too much better -- downtown isn't really much more vibrant than the navy yard area, the fun stuff is uptown and places where they haven't built too many hotels yet.

I listened to a homelessness episode on podcast called ""You're wrong about.""

The states that piloted/experimented with PSH (Idaho was one I think) reduced ""chronic homelessness"" by something like 80%. In addition, people who choose to live that way are vanishingly rare: like the one person in the article, they don't trust the system to actually work.

The problem is this all-or-nothing attitude that pervades our society. We'd rather do nothing (leaving 100% of people to suffer), than something that only helps 80% of people.

This is some of the dumbest shit I‚Äôve read all day and I read a ton of incredibly stupid shit on this site lol. 

People with mental illness and/or addiction issues need to be convinced they have a problem, have a willingness to quit, and realize that they need help.  Then it‚Äôs an ongoing challenge to stay clean. And here you are saying giving them a minimum wage job, having to piss in a cup, and having someone come by two times a month would accomplish all that.

One that understands what severe mental illness and addiction are apparently.

>Will you not be satisfied until the local city government has gone around and put a binky in every single adults mouth that just doesn‚Äôt want to work, sit around all day, do drugs, and shit on the ground?

Where the fuck did I say that?  I'm just not stupid enough to think that giving a junkie a minimum wage job will magically cure them of addiction.  For a lot of people, they're homeless precisely because they're addicts and can't hold a job.  These are the same sort of people who need free narcan that the city provides.

>Do you have semblance of an idea on what personal responsibility means in this world? On what being an adult is? And that yes, eventually, decisions have consequences?

I think you're inferring something from my post that I never said nor ever meant.

My point was that giving a junkie a job and a roof over their head won't do anything.  Junkies either are homeless because they became too addicted and couldn't hold a job or they became homeless through other factors, became addicted to drugs to cope and now can't hold a job.  A lot of these addicts likely don't even want a job, you can't give someone something they don't even want.  I don't know what the solution is because I don't care enough to figure one out, if I had one, I'd run for office.

These people won't become productive members of society until they get clean and/or get treated for their severe mental illness (a person who yells and talks to themselves can't hold a job either...also, and I'm going on a hunch here, they likely wouldn't want a job anyway).  Not sure what the solution to that is which does not mean I'm ok with how things are going now nor does it mean I'm one of those ""just let them camp around, scream at nothing, and do drugs all day"" weirdos.",1,2021,9,2,1,0

1957,h2amr6r,o374jc,brienneofbark,"Hey, yes it's pretty skilled and cool. Just like driving monster trucks is skilled and cool. But they do that in designated areas. And these are definitely NOT cowboys galloping in town.

 In my post, I agree that DC needs to consider a designated location for these riders, but even if it exists, the thrill and joy comes from riding on the streets and posturing in front of pedestrians and yes, even the police. 

These kids are not DC kids enjoying their summer. These are kids driving in from MD, where there ARE designated dirt bike tracks, who come into DC to cause chaos and show off. 

Yes, police chases have caused rider deaths, which is why police chases were banned.

But since the car chase ban, there have been multiple incidents of pedestrians being killed or maimed as well as car accidents all caused by illegal off-road vehicle drivers.

You cannot compare ANY city in 2021 to what it was like in the 90s. This entire area in the 80s-90s was DRASTICALLY different, so if you wanna go back to when U&14th was the red light district of DC, be my guest.

2207,ie2qf9i,vmknzh,capcityff918,"I definitely don't disagree with everything you're saying.  DC is not going through the same issues at they were in the 90s, as the murder capital.  DC has been gentrifying for some time now and the homicide rate dropped quickly.  However, it's still gentrifying and the rate is rising again.  Like I said, 88 homicides in 2012.  It's been rising for a decade now.  226 last year and this year looks to be worse.  So the rate is definitely trending in the wrong direction.  Could it be safe again in 10 years?  Absolutely.  Though I still see it getting worse before it gets better.

I don't know too much about police assignments, as I'm on the fire side.  In fire, we have no choice on where we are placed, but  we can request transfers.  This results in a lot of younger guys transferring to fire houses east of the river, Trinidad, Shaw, Columbia Heights, Petworth, or where the action is.  They want the experience and are very excited about their job.  Areas in upper NW, like Georgetown or the Palisades, are commonly filled with older guys trying to slow down.

As far as policy to aide in this, I have no idea where to even start.  It's not something I'm very knowledgeable about and I'll never claim to be.  This younger generation is much different though.  The crime in the 90s was in many major cities hit hard by the crack epidemic.  Now, there seems to be a lot more random shootings over minor issues.

NoMa gets a bad rep because of its past. Before the Harris Teeter, before the dog run, before the Metro was built there, before Tony Williams was mayor, the neighborhood wasn't great. In fact, it was quite shitty. But since those things above have happened the neighborhood have improved quite a bit. For one there are the apartments you're talking about moving into. On the east side of 2nd street there's a neighborhood full of long-term residents who've witnessed the bad and the good and they're happy that things are improving. There's a police sub-station on 2nd between M and Florida, too, with plenty of squad cars driving around throughout the day and night. Don't get me wrong, like any neighborhood east of the park, plenty of crimes are committed in the area. I wouldn't say it's any more or less than anywhere else though people might disagree (""But tummlr, NoMa is near North Capital Street!"" ""Tummlr you fool, NoMa is adjacent to the projects"" ""There are clubs in the area!"" etc.) It's crime, it's random, it happens everywhere, and you can protect yourself by being vigilant and using common sense. Even still, shit happens. Will you have to stay in your apartment when the sun goes down? No, there are no vampires in Northeast. 

The best thing to do is this: come around the neighborhood one evening and walk around, see what happens, and make your decision based on that.

There might be a mugging at the metro one day. But the city averages over 10,000 people per square mile. So there are really a few thousand people closer to the crime than you. 

Add into this that crime is often opportunistic or targeted. Violent groups often target each other. Or criminals will break into a car with a backpack inside. So a lot of the danger can be generally avoided by avoiding certain hot spots and following a few base rules about leaving luxury items out. In general I've generally felt more frustrated and angry about crime than I have unsafe. I'm a young guy so YMMV. 

And for me the benefits of living in the city are way higher than living in Arlington. There is a much greater variety of everything and a much greater closeness to fun things.
