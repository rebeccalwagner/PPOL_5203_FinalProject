When walking through cities you gotta spot the weirdos like 50+ feet away and make a beeline around them. Pick them out of the crowd at a distance and you won’t have to deal with them up close.

Cross the street if you have to to avoid them and don’t feel ashamed. I see people all the time casually walk within arms length of severely mentally ill people while they’re having an episode- screaming, pants down, flailing — You’re never to blame in those scenarios if accosted, but *don’t* put that risk upon yourself, that’s 101. 

Don’t speak to those people, don’t make eye contact, don’t go anywhere near someone while they’re having a psychotic episode. This has always been the golden rule from multiple psychiatrists in my family and it’s proven true, having growing up in 1990s NYC.

I’m sorry this has happened to you. There’s little doubt the streets have gotten far messier in DC since the pandemic. If anyone *ever* touches you or threatens you on the street in public, make a scene, call 911 and don’t feel embarrassed.

By the way, 911 here is very unreliable. But if you “go loud” in a public place, you will in most scenarios attract attention - the good kind.

lp3l0xj,1fpo3o7,under_psychoanalyzer,"Take people who are obviously have paranoid delusionals off the streets. I don't actually know why its worse in DC than a lot of other US cities. I'm not a expert on vulnerable communities. Like yes we let juveniles go a lot. Part of it could be that we actually do what is *supposed* to be good in terms of public housing, and we dont put it all in one area. Even though EOTR is certainly higher in certain crime, Adams morgan, foggy bottom, etc. all have public housing where as other cities administration would just building public housing EOTR happily segregating it.


The US in general has a very large problem where we simply don't have mental aslyums anymore. We ran them very poorly until we stopped having them altogether around the time of Nixon IIRC. Bush also cut of a bunch of funding IIRC because at some point in the 2000s if you tried to commit suicide it went from actual inpatient psychiatric care in hospitals to being handcuffed to a bed for 72 hours then kicked to the curb. That's the same place funding for these people on the streets would come from. Then on top of that the ACLU argued a case that set a precedent that makes it *incredibly* difficult to commit someone without their own or their families consent. So across all of America, if someone needs to be taken off the street because they're having a mental psych episode, if they dont want to go, the only option is jail. 


In DC this is probably, as a guess, not an expert, compounded because we don't have a place to put even people doing criminal acts. One of the perks of no statehood is we don't even have much of a jail. Like think about if we actually arrested every person walking around the city right now obviously out of their mind and who has threatened somebody recently? We don't have the resources to process, hold, and transport all those people. 


With all fentanyl and all the other crazy shit going on this country needs to get over its aversion to long term psychiatric holds. But Republicans don't want to pay for ""freeloaders"" and Democrats dont want to ""marginalize"" already downtrodden people, even if long term care is literally someone's only hope. 


If it had an easy solution we'd do it. But the answer like a lot of DC problems is: we're not a state and we're afraid to jail people, even though the latter happened as a result of good intentions we swung the pendulum too far imho. But what the fuck do I know.",10,2024,9,2,1,"1, 4"

Lol, if you were interested in having a good faith discussion, you would bring the statistics you allude to rather than assume my level of awareness and invite me to ""look up the stats.""

You moved the goalpost and are now speaking of evidence based discussion but originally used an unfalsifiable claim of your own experience living in several areas. But you seem happy to discount the anecdotes of others and require stats when you receive pushback. ""Normal"" isn't an evidence based term, by the way. It's very subjective and relies on individual perspective. Which is basically my whole point. Someone like my wife who grew up in small town America and has been harassed and assaulted numerous times in her small town life, but has experienced zero of the same since moving to NYC or DC is a great example of of what I'm saying.

I agree that Atlanta has lost its southern hospitality years ago after so many transplants moved here. People are still nice though… until they get in their cars and they are downright nasty. I laugh at dmv drivers when I’m there bc Atlanta drivers are so much worse in many ways. When I moved to Atlanta, a southern woman gave me her bed after she found out that I had nowhere to stay that night. Can’t get more kind and trusting than that, but that was 30 years ago. People are not that way anymore in many areas all over the US. I still do think people are more warm in Atlanta though in general. 

In DC metro, there are so many people who are mostly there for government work, like lobbyists, politicians, politician’s interns, diplomats, attorneys, etc and they don’t feel a sense of wanting to belong the way true residents do. My mom had a lobbyist neighbor and he was one of the nastiest people I’ve ever met. Her other neighbor worked for the World Bank and while they were nice, they kept to themselves and their Bangladeshi friends. Also in the 20ish years I lived in dc metro, I don’t recall anyone randomly being friendly as I walked down the street. When I moved to Atlanta and people started saying hi and waving, I was immediately suspicious and grumpy, at first thinking they weren’t greeting me and then “what do they want from me?”  because even though I knew people in my MD neighborhood, no one ever said hi. We definitely didn’t know anyone in my grandparents neighborhood even though they lived there for 30-40 years. And no one ever said hi in the district when walking down the street that I recall. People were usually busy rushing doing whatever they doing. 

I am happy that you are enjoying the DMV though, considering I love it there and miss it a lot. I’ve thought about moving back so many times, but the cost of buying a house and other living expenses there is so much more expensive than it is in Atlanta. DC has so much more going for it, although Atlanta metro is more livable from my pov. I know Atlanta is catching up in terms of cost of living but I still think it’s cheaper here overall, even living in the city. I also miss the intelligence and culture of the people in DC metro.

htjh7lc,s8cihs,classicalL,"So you are mostly spot on in my opinion. I'm a native but I have lived elsewhere. Frankly LA driving style is far worse than the constant complaints about MD drivers by the region...

WMATA is great, second honestly only to living in NYC (which I have done). LA, Boston, Chicago, SF. I've uses these systems (not MARTA though), and DC's transport system is better than pretty much all of those. Maybe SF is close, NYC is better. Right now though it is very empty so. Hopefully that will change. But right now the headways are bad. In the 90s and 00s WMATA was AMAZING. It turned out that was deferring tons of maintenance. But they ran trains to super late with low headways and nothing was broken. We are paying for those days now. Nevertheless it is still a really good system. Go to Europe and have the transit workers all go on strike. The union has problems and the org needs to fix some structural problems but it will get better. If gas prices go up enough ridership will return if people either get used to COVID or it dies back.

DC is largely gentrified out. That's a very different feel than it was in the 90s. Some old timers don't like that, but the city is on the whole a lot safer and cleaner than it was in NE in particular but also near the waterfront.

DC has so many cultural things and many of them free, it spoils you. Again if COVID would just get a lid on things even more stuff about the city would come back and be enjoyed. The region is ridiculously educated. Amazon didn't site HQ2 here just for money reasons... I honestly thing DC was hitting a critical size where it would grow from regional demand rather than just Fed money. 

DC feels more like a city than LA does honestly but less like a city sometimes than even Baltimore because it doesn't have that high rise center that so many cities have with the taller buildings near Union Station or in VA. Hopefully any zoning will be removed and we can have the stuff behind Union Station get really tall and it will feel like that is the city center. I don't know. Berlin has a pretty low rise spread out feel also but it is way dirtier and gritter like parts of NYC and not the good ones.

I guess I have gone on my own tangent but DC's region is one of the best in the country and the best for certain specific things. People are far to enamored with the west coast cities which honestly aren't that interesting for the most part.",2,2022,1,2,1,"1, 8"

If/when DC goes back to normal, traffic will become horrific and so will the metro 😭. Metro is much more expensive than Marta but is way more useful - I used to live in Brookhaven and the only reason why I used Marta was to get to the airport. 

Some advice - when using the metro escalators, left side of the step = walking side & right side = standing side! Don’t ever stand on the left side of escalator steps, even when it isn’t packed.

In both apartments I've lived in and both buildings I've worked in here, I've had people literally stare at the floor, the wall or the ceiling as they walk by me in a hallway, to avoid looking at me or having to say any sort of hello. This has happened at least a dozen times, with different people in different placesso I know I'm not imagining it. 

People will either rush to get into their apartment and shut the door if they see you coming, or if they're halfway out the door, will go back inside and shut the door until you pass. This behavior was all happening pre-Covid so I can't blame it on that.

I've said ""Hello"" to people when we passed by a foot from each other on the sidewalk in a residential area and had them just look at me like I was a tree or a car and not say a word. I'd say there's a 50/50 chance of that happening vs getting a response.",27,2022,1,2,1,0

I thought of Atlanta because it's close to family, but I don't like the lower salaries, crime, or traffic. I've had the same weird experiences as you in apartment complexes too. One day I was just chillin at the mailbox on a bluetooth call. There was this one lady who I sorta liked, but never got to talk to that was my neighbor. She just sat there waiting for me to get out, like she wanted me to go first so she didn't have to say anything to me. It was weird.

I've noticed dating is hard too there in that in Atlanta it seemed like people only talk to groups of people that they grew up with. The cost of living worries me with DC though. Some of the suburbs of Atlanta like Alpharetta, Sandy Springs, and Roswell have homes that are 600k+, which don't make sense considering most jobs only pay 40 to 60k.

Meanwhile the stuff near Union Station is to the extent possible on a grid. It would feel like the ""real"" city center if it got tall. The technical downtown is near the white house, but non of that is going to become new tall buildings. Bethesda has more of a shot of being city like.

Agreed about the Beltline! It will be wonderful when that's completed. Unincorporated DeKalb County is awful for sidewalks IMHO, though, while unincorporated Montgomery County has trails connecting cul-de-sacs in remote parts of the county per Google Maps. Holy shit.

Tbh DC IMHO beats the Buford Highway because so many different avenues are like it. Check out Honduran eats on Huntington Avenue, Vietnamese on Wilson/Clarendon, Ethiopian on Georgia Avenue, Salvadoran on Columbia Pike and Baltimore Avenue, if you haven't already. Peruvian of course, everywhere, plus Iranian. Buford Highway was good but there is so much inexpensive international food everywhere here. I get ehhh pupusas for $3 in my home burb in Cincinnati and amazing carefully prepared ones here for $2 in College Park or Arlington. Idk, just stating this if you haven't explored the hole in the wall food scene. Oh I forgot about Colombian food in Silver Spring (Arepas Pues).

Lol, I think we have opposite feelings about weather. It beats Philly (less cold/windy/super rainy) and Atlanta (skull slapping humidity, thunderstorms, and frequent power outages). Frankly even Cincy and Cincinnati weather is pretty reasonable. The summer was nowhere near as miserable as Atlanta and the winter is not like Philly or even Cincinnati, where it can reach 0°F with no humidity. Nose bleed time lol. Philly I think is the worst because it's hot and humid or cold, rainy, humid, and windy. Here gets hot and cold but I don't have rain flying into my bones through three layers like Philly.

* Alexandria housed the largest human trafficking (slave-trading) company in the US. A major factor in retrocession of DC land to VA was to try to protect this slave trade from a potential abolitionist majority in Congress, which could end slavery in DC.

jwady54,15qu0ac,,"My answer to 4 is that D.C. is actually pretty terrible at producing public space to *dwell*, for hours. Users often (correctly) praise the city’s walkability, but we don’t tend to converse about that other crucial part of any urban environment: the ability to dwell. Every time people bring up the urbanist wet-dream cities like Barcelona, they tend to talk about walkability, commerce, sustainability, etc. All of these are important, but one crucial aspect missed is that Barcelona, Madrid, Amsterdam, etc, have different *spatial imperatives*. Put simply, there’s a difference in what a body is obliged to do. 

In Washington, D.C., a body is obliged to walk, but only walk. Parks are pretty far apart, and many don’t offer much beyond the ability to sit on a hard bench that may or may not have a curved back to prevent napping (yay, anti-homeless architecture). The action, for example, of stopping and chilling on a certain sidewalk will earn you some dirty looks and maybe some dirty words. Most of this city is a sidewalk. This never became more apparent than when I had to walk with my elderly father to the Optometrist’s. He could obviously have benefited from a place to chill at certain points, but even those terrible benches are not so populated within the city. I’ve seen many people sit on those sidewalk-level window sills of stores, just to catch a break from the incessant movement our design commands. Watch one 4K walking tour of these European cities that we want to emulate: they just congregate wherever the fuck they want. It’s seen as normal to just stand, to lean on things, to exist as you feel comfortable. They don’t need a designated space. Hell, we need that designated space more than the Europeans, and we don’t even have as many! We don’t have those wonderful, directionless squares/piazzas they do. 

There will probably be some able-bodied, young to middle-aged Redditors that contest what I’m saying, but as the great sociologist Richard Sennett says, most cities aren’t built for seniors. Really, you could expand that and say most American cities aren’t built for anyone outside of a particularly envisioned urban subject, one who is either physically indefatigable, or a driver.",1,2023,8,2,1,0

My father, a machinist-turned-electrical-engineer, spent his career at metro developing these signs.  I remember dinner table conversations about realtime computing and how to reconcile the train schedule with actuaI location readings.  And how to do it all within the constraints of legacy hardware with limited memory and bitrates.  I remember his consideration on displaying train length on the board.  Or whether reclaiming some space with an abbreviation would create confusion.  I remember when he took me to see the sign prototypes in the lab several levels below ground in the Jackson building.  And when he started to get sick, pushing him to work in his wheelchair to that same basement.  He described working for metro as passion, not a job.  I'm reminded of that passion every time I wait for the train and see one of these signs.  Eight months into the quarantine and i suppse that's been a while.  So seeing yours hit me like an emotional ton of bricks.

I miss him so much.  I love your project and I'd have loved to show it to him.  I know he'd have appreciated your work and i know hed have loved the signs too.

For now, if you’re interested in getting started with Home Assistant, here’s how I did the WMATA integration:

1.	I used Node-RED to handle the WMATA API requests. There was a lot response parsing with the WMATA API, so Node-RED made it easier to manipulate the payloads.
2.	Node-RED, after parsing the API responses, creates a sensor in Home Assistant - one for each station/track combo based on the stations monitored in the Node-RED flow.
3.	The sensor contains attributes for the response values, as well as a formatted HTML attribute for use in the Home Assistant front-end.
4.	I’m using Home Assistant custom secondary-info card to display the formatted HTML below the sensor value.

Happy to help you or anyone else who would be interested in setting this up in Home Assistant. Definitely was a fun project to do!

jwblfoo,15rvy1v,harkuponthegay,"Those two viewpoints aren’t incompatible though— I’d argue that most of the “car < bike” people are motivated primarily by environmental concerns. The same goes for the anti suburban stance— it is a poor use of space to spread people out that way when they could be concentrated closer to the places they work. Again, environmental. 

On the other hand the “crime is a reality of city living” view is not environmentally motivated at all— that perspective is socioeconomically motivated (and often race plays a role as well). 

The belief there is generally that crime is an artifact of poverty, lack of opportunity, community conflict, and the trauma of institutional racism which are disproportionately experienced by poor and minority populations. In this sense it is seen as a social injustice to “eradicate crime” from the city because in order to do so one would either have to:

- eliminate poverty
- remove the poor  

And generally the latter ends up being easier to accomplish than the former (and more widely supported by the folks that feel that poor people deserve to be punished; or those that simply don’t want to acknowledge their existence).

It’s not all about environmentalism, though.

It’s important to note that advocates for urban living and alternative modes of transport (besides just cars) see great value in the fiscal efficency that is gained from increased density. The idea is to build a society where there is enough cash in the coffers to offer robust social programs to abate tendencies towards socioeconomically motivated crime *and* the city budget actually balances out. 

This is because it’s insanely expensive to offer city amenities to near-rural population densities, and these expenses sap a great deal of money from tax revenue which is mostly generated in urban areas. Combine that with the fact that it’s expensive and time consuming for an individual to get anywhere with the costly car that’s required to exist and it’s a lose-lose situation. Society and the individual are fiscally worse off. 

I would go so far as to say that the environmental impact is actually considered a nice but incidental knock-on effect to the “car < bike” people.

That’s what, we all agree with - we aren’t in total disagreement. 

The problem I have with just “throw them in jail” is that doesn’t rehabilitate them! As it relates to argument (a) they do have PLENTY of opportunity but you do know how intellectually disability/lack of education  creates low self confidence. Self-efficacy is needed to get and keep a job. To learn, to Adapt, and have other skills necessary for all job stability. It’s non empathic to just say, people don’t want to work; they might have mental barriers to getting and/or keeping a job; (2) likely those who are worse off, have strong family support. Think about it, tons of folks live with their supportive parents until they find a job, save for a house, and move out. Heck, now, even folks who get degrees often have to move back home. Not everyone has that family support. Let’s be real. 

Ah, yes, you could give these some folks free money. They’d blow it because their morals/values align with materialism. Often, those folks don’t realize they have low self-confidence and buy expensive things as a proxy for self-worth. Social media has heightened folks lack of self confidence with ignorant folks liking someone wearing designers clothes; when in reality, people should be saying, “why do you value designer clothes more than education, charity for others, and/or your relationships?

First off, the ""courtroom"" operates just like with adults, except the sentence upon conviction is ""services."" ""Services"" include probation, meetings with counselors, enforced compliance with IEPs  (specialized educational programs for kids who can't function in a normal classroom). In egregious cases like this, unless they're charged as an adult, they're not getting ""locked up,"" at most, they'll go to a camp for a year or so, focused on rehabilitation

Think about that for a second. Services are a penalty to be enforced after ""conviction"".

So then you have public defenders fighting to get the kids off applying the same notion of due process, proof beyond a reasonable doubt, preservation of liberty etc. that we do in adult cases. Except no one's going to jail or paying fines. They're receiving treatment. And we deprive kids of their liberties for their own good all the time, (e.g., mandatory school attendance)

So imagine you're this victim. Possible outcomes are 1) Public defender is successful, nothing happens 2) Kid is ""convicted"" (it's not called that)  and maybe he gets ""services,"" and at most, he goes away to a facility for a year.

There are moms out there who might be addicted to drugs and unavailable to parent, but the vast majority of moms are trying damn hard to keep their kids on the straight and narrow. Unless you have been a poor single mom, do NOT go there. I have never met an executive or white dude or dude period who could pull off what a poor single mom does. 2.) Particularly in this era, it is incredibly difficult to parent kids when the phone and internet is overwhelmingly controlling all of society. I am super strict at home, as are my friends, and yet.....the crap they see on the internet is terrifying and normalized. 3.) The amount of mentally ill people out there is huge and there are virtually zero resources. Therapists and psychiatrists are at least a 12 month waiting list, sometimes 18 months. Parents who were abused and might be battling addictions or have other bad coping skills cannot break free without help. Then their kids enter the same vicious circle.  CPTSD requires years and years of intense therapy and appx. zero people in society are willing to get that for all the poor and homeless that require it. 4.) There are kids out there with bipolar, ADHD, ASD, schizophrenia, et al and they cannot get help - no matter how hard the parents try. Schools just do not care at all.

Recall all those high-school brawls and not once did anyone do anything correctly. You don’t need stamina, this isn’t a  30 minute sporting event. Street defense is about full power against an untrained, over-confident opponent harming you or another community member. 

That being said, people trained in self-defense/combat sports should not go around pounding on juveniles. Juveniles also may carry weapons. Even an untrained knife opponent will likely get a few thrusts in before they are incapacitated.

An in shape 35 year old, who knows what the fuck they're doing, is way better than an 18 year old for experience in using their body and muscle mass (again, everything being individual). 

Anyway weird argument, lol. But yes, if you don't feel comfortable intervening if you think there might be, or already is, violence...don't. But a 35 year old won't shatter like glass against an 18 year old. The only thing I'd say is most of these 13 year olds probably have more experience in fighting than the average guy and people who have no clue wtf they're doing could get rocked by one kid who knows how to hit. Shrug.

And the real issue is numbers, intervening by yourself against a group is dangerous. Pretty much no one is going to be able to fight 6+ kids, even fucking 13 year olds, without getting beat a bit or worse. That's why intervening doesn't have to mean violence but intervening in violence could still help someone, more people might come (depending on circumstances) egged on by your intervention (don't count on it but it happens) and more importantly it might stop the other attack against someone much less able to do shit about it and make the kids more likely to gtfo of dodge.

It's not preposterous that everyone around that area is masked up, and you would know this if you commute there. 

At the end of the day masking has nothing to do with being liberal or conservative, it's about protecting your hygiene. Mask wearing is prominent in Asian countries for this reason. If you want to be maskless outside where people can freely move that's fine, but in a tightly enclosed space like the metro I believe wearing a mask is the decent thing to do. It's also the absolute bare minimum -- I'm not even saying everyone needs to be vaccinated or boosted.

I'm not a cynic, and I believe people can change. If you're one of those who think masks can't mitigate the spread of covid, studies indicate the opposite. [The CDC states that cloth masks can block over 80% of fine particles and droplets.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/science-briefs/masking-science-sars-cov2.html) There is also a list of several other studies on this page backing the efficacy of masks.

It was commensurate with the total amount of leave provided to coworkers who had sick leave separate and was considered (by me at least) as an advantage to have this flexibility. This classification is made for positions with greater responsibilities, some of which are going to accrue while you are away and be your responsibility when you return from illness or vacation.

I have had very little opportunity to take vacation the past two years and fortunately have avoided illness, and now have a good amount of PTO saved up and hoping for several extended vacations in the next year or so.

You are right about NYC its a much safer feeling city despite having about 10 times more people. Flooding the zone visibly does seem to have a deterrence effect also (like in the subways)

In 2004 the neighborhood was THE going out scene, 18th Street would be so crowded that vehicles the road would be clogged with pedestrian traffic.   At last call it was pandemonium.  In the summer muggings of drunk people was a daily occurrence.  

That year an officer was shot pursuing a criminal.  After that there were large amounts of police, at least 20 officers on the street at night on the weekends.   That continued but gradually lessened until COVID... then BLM.

It is shocking to me that during drinking hours there are not more officers out.  

The police nationwide have changed their approach to policing post BLM.  In my humble opinion police are not paid by the arrest, and I think DC metro decided that they are going to not try as hard to arrest and detain suspects, as well as simply not put themselves in harms way.  Why?  because they don't have to - they get paid regardless. 

Every time and officer tries to arrest someone several of those outcomes result in the officer being fired, suspended, killed, or hurt. Only one is good, the suspect surrenders peacefully, and as I said before they aren't being paid a bonus for that.

Additionally, police should be educated on the law (at least criminal) in a similar manner to law school and undergo deescalation and social service training. Take that 9-18 month police training and and turn it into 2.5 years imo.

Anyways, I do think *some* cops are good and deserve positive recognition. And those cops absolutely do risk their lives if they’re actually doing their jobs. 

Whether it’s traffic management (a Maryland driver could strike at any time), riot control (the ones that defended the Capital from Jan. 6th traitors not the ones that let them in), gang investigation (undercovers could be killed if discovered - we **know** it’s gangs bringing fent into our communities), confronting someone with unlawful use of a gun, saving someone from an abuser, or even some simple traffic stops, the *good* police officers are entering a situation that other professions may lack - an unpredictable and frequently unaccountable variable - other humans.

I’m not going to post clips as proof (they’re on the internet if you’re so desperate to see for yourself), but believe me when I say I have seen bodycam footage of officers responding to situations that should be otherwise safe and peaceful only for the person they are interacting with to suddenly stab or shoot them.

With jobs in agriculture and - to a lesser degree - small engine mechanics, many of the the factors which are dangerous *are* predictable and should be properly accounted for if the job is being performed correctly - many deaths can be avoided by simply paying attention. When you interact with other humans you just have no way of truly knowing how they will react and what their plan is. 

Underwater welders, electrical linesman, and oil-rig workers, however, can prep and account for all they want and they will still frequently die. THOSE are jobs that really truly risk their lives on a day-to-day basis.

Anyways please don’t call me a bootlicker, that’ll hurt my feelings, just trying to offer up another way of looking at it but please understand that I also believe that our country’s current police systems 100% need to be overhauled lol.",2,2024,8,2,1,"1,5"

Mount Pleasant has a larger population and has greater connection to the rest of the city (it really bleeds into Columbia Heights and Petworth) so it will attract more crime. But really MP is more suburban than most parts of the district; more so than Cleveland Park/TenleyTown which is more gated diplomatic mansions flanked by apartments.  MP is poorer and more diverse, and with that comes more crime, but it also has a stronger community spirit that makes most people I know who live there feel safer than the coldness and isolation of some of DC’s western suburbs.

Cleveland Park is safer mostly because it is in the middle of nowhere with little accessibility, and there is practically no nightlife to speak of. For many people this isn’t a drawback. If you are looking for someplace that is simply safer, it’s a better pick. But aside from some nice restaurants and a (really!) great Italian deli, there is not much of a draw to the area.

h3cfvro,o930zn,kswissbeats,"I had the same interaction with this man in early May walking around downtown/Penn Quarter. His story was the same as others have recounted (and physical description) - stopped me under the pretense of looking for a coffee shop, new to town from NY and parents live in NOVA. Within 3 minutes he had gotten my number and kissed me on the head - I immediately walked away unsettled that I let a stranger touch me on the streets - it all just happened so fast. My instincts were that something was off, but after 3 ignored texts from him I finally answered and agreed to meet up for coffee the following week. He kept insisting I meet him at 1500 Mass Ave and ignored my suggestions for other places. I decided to attempt some internet research with only his first name and phone number and found a limited social media presence that my gut found strange so I decided to bail at the last minute claiming a work meeting came up. He immediately got aggressive over text message, “You’re a fucking loser. You’re not worth my time or my dick.” I promptly blocked him knowing I had made the right call not to meet up with him and my womens intuition was spot on. I’d chalked it up to a funny dating anecdote until a friend sent me this thread today.",34,2021,6,2,1,"1, 4"

He stopped me on the corner of 13th and L asking if I knew any good coffee spots. I listed off a few suggestions. Then he said he just moved here from NYC and was looking for good coffee and to meet new people and asked if I wanted to get a cup of coffee with him. I said no that I needed to be somewhere else. He started asking if I lived in the area, where did I work. I was stuck at a crosswalk and had to wait for the light to change in order to get away. He could tell I was uncomfortable and pointed out my wedding ring and said he wasn't trying to hit on me. Then pressured me into giving him my phone number so that we could meet up. I ended up giving it to him (stupid I know) just to get him to leave me alone. I then quickly walked away. He texted me a few times asking to meet up but I never responded. Then about a month ago a man stopped me to ask for directions to a good coffee shop. I was distracted and started giving him directions before realizing it was the same guy. He began asking me to get coffee with him. I said no and quickly walked away. Again this was on 13th and L
Then yesterday I was on 13th and K and the same man asked me for coffee shops. When I realized it was him I froze and immediately walked away. I looked back and noticed he kept turning around and looking at me as I walked away.

One day this man and I walked past each other and he asked if there was a good Mexican restaurant nearby. We got to talking, he seemed super normal/respectful/cute and we exchanged numbers. He hugged me goodbye and kissed me on the cheek.

  
He asked me out for a midday walk date the next day. On the walk, he spoke almost entirely in sexual innuendos, said that my dress would be sexy if it flew up and proceeded to lift it up in the back on a very populated street. He ended our walk outside his apartment. He kept talking about different entrances to get in. I went to leave, and he pulled me in to kiss me. I turned and said “not on a first date” and he proceeded to kiss my neck — also on a very public street.

  
He texted later and said I had been a tease. I disengaged, but he kept texting me sexual things for a week. I finally lied and said I was seeing someone. He texted “I don’t give a fuck if you’re seeing someone, NYC girls say I’m the best pussy eater.”

  
Months later, we crossed paths in DC (I had sunglasses on, he didn’t recognize me). He asked “Hey, do you know if this building is really part of XX school?”, I pretended not to hear him. But he shouted, “ma’am? Excuse me?”

Favorite - walk/transit/bike-ability

Edit because I actually read the post this time lol:
I hate the humidity here. It is my least favorite thing about DC. But it is in part balanced out by long a long and gorgeous spring! I grew up near Chicago where spring always seemed to be 2 weeks long. But here it’s like 3 months of really nice weather before the heat and humidity really hits. The winters are mild, and fall is also gorgeous. It all beats (or at least balances) out the gross July and August. 

Here is what else beats the humidity: it is a gorgeous city. It’s beautiful. I will never get tired of walking around. The city has so much going on but it’s compact. I can either metro or bike anywhere in like 30 minutes. I can metro to the airport in 40 minutes. People are always outside. There is a lot of green space and people use it. There are always events going on. We have amazing free museums. There is a ton of nice (not west-coast scenic, but nice) hiking within a couple hours drive.

l292pgk,1cfy8o2,Joedirt112,"Cons:

* People on this sub like to tout how walkable/public transport friendly this city is. True, sometimes. But metro stops running super early. Where I live, it'd take me 45+ min to get to Union Station, despite being a 15 min drive. I went to Baltimore for an Oriole's game today - about an hour drive, Transit app estimated 2:25 hours with public transit.

* lack of convenience store/bodega culture. Yeah, there are a few places to grab a snack late-night. But a 15-20min walk each way is not convenient. In NYC, I can go ten steps any direction and find a bodega.

* alcohol laws are stupid as hell. You can't buy beer in gas stations/7-eleven... ok, fine. But not being able to buy a six-pack of beer on a Friday night after midnight is ridiculous.

* Lack of an artistic/creative subculture. Everyone got priced out and moved to Baltimore. Yeah, you can find indie or DIY shows here and there, but only if you actively seek it out and go to the one single place that is hosting something on a Friday night. I wish I could just pop into my neighborhood bar and experience a less square culture. I don't mean to sound like an asshole, but it seems to me that DC is generally much more of a straight-laced, squeeky-clean personality type town than any other city. A lot of my friends come from middle of nowhere Midwest.. Obviously this city is gonna seem incredible compared to that; but there is nothing artsy, punk, or rebellious readily available here, even if some people say there is

* food sucks. There's a lot of good restaurants apparently - I don't know, I can't afford to go to them. There is a SEVERE lack of cheap eats/street food here. The halal place by my house in Columbia Heights charges over $15 for a chicken over rice platter. That's fucking insane!!!! Even with prices going up in NY, I still have never paid more than $8 for the same shit that tastes better and has more food

* Niche, but its too flat and the weather sucks. I want snow in the winter. I want to snowboard in the winter. Closest option? 4 hours to a shit hill in PA or WV. I'm admittedly salty here, but I wish I had more readily accessible cold climates/mountains here.

*No dive bars, no Irish pubs, no neighborhood haunts. Yeah, there are some, but it's just not the same here.


Pros:
* lots of space. More greenery. An average block here is much more open, spacious, and breathable than a random block in Brooklyn. 

* Interesting people - not to contradict myself earlier, but there is something about a city of transplants. I've learned more about the rest of the country than I ever have otherwise since I moved here. I find that amazing. There are also generally a lot of opportunities to experience a different culture here - I didn't know what Malort was before I moved here, but I could go with some midwest friends to Ivy and Coney and get a small taste of their regional culture.

* Sports venues are super easy to get to

Even has roof access and a nice little park (Mitchell Park) one street over.

Looks like they have a 550 sq ft junior one bedroom up on Craigslist right now for $1295, all utilities included. I really don't think you'd find anything close to that price in any of the surrounding areas.

Edit: They're also offering 1 month free (COVID times, I guess). So factoring in that savings, it comes to just $188/month over your budget for the first year.

Greeted by armed guard and every aisle blared every time I entered, annoying but I can understand why.

Bought 2 boxes tissues, 1 pack of floss picks, 1 container of vaseline, (1) am/pm combo pack of store brand cold/flu syrup, and (1) container of contact solution. Total came to $60.....$60 fucking dollars for less than a bag full of basic items.

the name brand Dayquil am/pm cold and flu was $40 alone....seriously. 

I completely understand why people are robbing these places and reselling, the corporation is straight up robbing consumers. Its criminal profiteering imo, my entire order shouldn't have cost more than $25 tops and wouldn't have a few years ago. I made the decision just to stop going to CVS now, i'll get what I need online, or shop around different grocery stores.

I suspect that number is inflated and/or represents total lost products due to shoplifting or other factors (such as accidental damage, etc.). CVS has an incentive to inflate that number to make the problem look worse in order to pressure local governments to subsidize their security. If you think otherwise feel free to check the annual report.

CVS has been penalized over $100 million for wage theft violations over the past 20 years and studies show wage theft is typically recovered at a rate of around 1-2%.  So that works out to $250M - $500M annually. And that’s probably a conservative estimate.

Wage theft is so commonplace and employees are so powerless to fight it, that we often don’t even notice when it happens.  

The “your shift starts at 9 so show up 20 minutes early to make sure you are ready for your shift” attitude is so common that most people don’t recognize that it’s illegal to not pay employees for that 20 minutes.

Note that Dugan was specifically referring to organized retail crime, or ""professional shoplifters,"" and was excluding all the casual shoplifters who operate independently.  Dugan did not specify how much the casual shoplifters steal in a typical year.  Dugan also did not provide a figure for losses attributable to theft by CVS employees, but that's likely a large number as well.  See, for example:

Sure, CVS has settled some wage theft cases over the past 20 years, sometimes for millions of dollars.  And I don't doubt that there are some ongoing violations where employees are not being paid for all of their time.

(1) multiple arrests in DC

(2) an MPD SUV driving up behind a sedan with lights blazing, multiple cops jumping out with weapons and detaining all 4 occupants of the vehicle on the sidewalk

(3) MPD personnel kill someone just outside my apartment at night (I was asleep and did not witness, but could look out my apt window and see the spot a hundred feet away) - https://www.npr.org/local/305/2021/08/27/1031669151/d-c-police-release-footage-following-their-fatal-shooting-of-antwan-gilmore

Law enforcement has been alive and well here since the BLM protests. Traffic enforcement is a double-edged sword in DC because it’s very easy for more harm to come from a chase. Cops have to choose their battles too.

We do need better ticket enforcement for VA and MD drivers who drive here with no regard for safety. That’s a political/state issue though. We also need better technology for tracking stolen cars, or just to do a better job of discouraging driving in DC.

As far as metro jumpers, it’s likely not cost-effective to have police at every metro gate every day. A person jumping is a few dollars lost income. WMATA is now installing new fare gates which can’t be jumped though; you can see them at some stations.

Rather than this being a “culture” of not enforcing laws, these are complex issues which need solutions.

Wage theft is likely the greater wrong in this case in pure dollar amount terms, for the reasons I’ve stated. But it’s also the greater moral wrong because the victim is a real person rather than corporate profits.

And if CVS closes stores in your area, blame CVS, not the thieves. CVS could choose to put people over profit and take measures to keep those stores open (or rather we could write laws that allow CVS to do that), but they don’t.

The reason I harp on wage theft is because I think it matters which crimes we give our attention.  Media attention leads to public focus leads to politician priorities leads to police enforcement.

We spend half a billion per year on law enforcement and yet violent crime continues to rise. 

In my opinion we should focus exclusively on violent crime until that starts to reduce. We can then move to property crime targeted at individuals. If we get both of those under control then maybe we can help corporations protect their assets.

CVS shoplifting losses are less than a tenth of a percent of total revenue annually (.06% in 2022). That’s the equivalent of 60 bucks for someone making $100k.  It’s less than I lose on package theft most years.

Neither you nor I know that stores gross revenue, which is what you need in order to determine its ""slip"" rate, or individual store loss.  You can computer the gross slip rate for CVS.  You have 1/2 of the information.  Gross revenue.  Now look for ""Gross Losses."" and determine a percentage.  See if it jives what what \*you\* think is for that single store.

Example:

CVS Gross Revenue:

[https://investors.cvshealth.com/investors/newsroom/press-release-details/2023/CVS-HEALTH-REPORTS-STRONG-FOURTH-QUARTER-AND-FULL-YEAR-2022-RESULTS/default.aspx](https://investors.cvshealth.com/investors/newsroom/press-release-details/2023/CVS-HEALTH-REPORTS-STRONG-FOURTH-QUARTER-AND-FULL-YEAR-2022-RESULTS/default.aspx)

2022: $322 Billion

From Al Gore's Internet:

""The country’s largest retail industry group, the National Retail Federation, estimated in its latest report that losses from organized retail theft average $700,000 per $1 billion in sales — or 0.07% of total sales — an amount roughly 330 times lower than the CRA’s estimate.""

Let's check their math:

CVS Gross Sales 2021: $322 Billion

""Siri, how many $700,000's are there in 322 Billion?""

Answer: 322B/$700K = 460,000

""Siri, How much is $700,000? x 322?""

Answer: ""225,400,000.00""

""Siri, expressed as a percentage, how much is $225,400,000/$322 Billion?""

Answer: .07%

.07 % (or seven tenths of a percent) is the total theft loss for ALL of CVS.  Not just one store.  So their math checks out.

Siri: ""What is the slip rate (loss from theft) for the Columbia Heights CVS Store?""

Answer:

[https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/10/03/shoplifting-organized-retail-crime-theft/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/10/03/shoplifting-organized-retail-crime-theft/)

&#x200B;

""The closest tracking comes from NRF; according to its last annual survey, involving 177 retail brands, shrink was responsible for $112.1 billion in losses in 2022. That’s a 19.4 percent spike from the $93.9 billion reported in 2021. More than half of those losses were attributed to employee theft and operational and processing errors, which climbed 29 and 27 percent, respectively.""

Thefore:  If employee theft & operational/processing errors account for (29+27 = 56%) then theft (or ""slip"") accounted for 44% of losses.

$112B x 44% = \~50 Billion in losses in 2021 from people stealing who aren't employees.  And this is an \*industry\* estimate.  Not just CVS or all Pharmacies.

And if employee theft is estimated at 29% (\~$32 Billion) then it seems that corporate wage theft is pretty closely canceled by employee retail theft.",1,2023,10,2,1,0

I was at Slipstream on that same block around the time of the tweet and had not seen or heard anything; texted a friend who lives literally one building over from the one in De Souza’s picture (facing I St., incidentally), and my friend had similarly not heard or seen anything. Later turned out to be police coordinating for opening day traffic to the stadium, but De Souza never gave any context/update to her photo and the tweet is still up. So she must have been having a slow news day and decided to stir the pot a bit with some half-truths. And it kinda worked: the comments under her post are, of course, entirely unhelpful (about Navy Yard being a war zone), and feature one person blaming crime in the neighborhood on buildings taking renters with housing vouchers. Which, from what I can tell, is the kind of discourse De Souza is aiming to strike up whoever she posts. When again, no crime had occurred in the image she posted.

I don’t have anything against folks keeping their neighbors alert and aware to crime or potentially dangerous activities in their neighborhoods. Navy Yard’s had a few high-profile crimes happen over the last few years, and there’s nothing wrong with wanting to have conversations around what can be done to prevent further incidents. 

But De Souza considerably undermines whatever credibility she may have when she posts to generate fake outrage. As OP said, Yellow had been upfront about their reopening in Navy Yard being temporary because they were planning to open up a new spot elsewhere. Yellow’s own post, which De Souza quote tweeted, says as much.

Encouraging people to be hypervigilant and scared to leave the house is a recipe for disaster and really doesn’t solve anything.

It's a dumb strawman for people to focus on that derails the question of whether car free spaces is even possible in the first place. I could provide you with a whole list of [places where cars are banned](https://www.bobvila.com/slideshow/pedestrians-only-20-car-free-places-in-america-51840) and then you'd respond with a ""hurrr those places aren't REAL CITIES"" and you'd think you won your strawman.

One post up the person is complaining about driving downtown because there's now too many non car threats to them downtown. The person also responded to the concept of not driving at all in the city (which many commuters and residents do) as completely impracticable.

There are no shortage of cities [around the world](https://archive.curbed.com/2017/5/17/15649210/car-free-places-city-island) and now with the [US](https://www.amny.com/transit/times-square-car-free-1-31982299/) they are proving with proper planning and infrastructure car free/limited cars spaces are possible and practical in parts of cities.

That is, you have people at the bottom of the income distribution living *very close* to folks near the top. In other cities and DC historically, you’d have different areas of the community generally representing different income brackets.

I left DC a few years ago (sadly), but moved there in 2010. 12th and U was sketchy as fuck for a long time, to the point that it blows my mind its become what it has. It's an area that gentrified so fast and so aggressively that it, at least imo, completely destroyed the fabric of the community, putting the people that lived there out on their ass. 

You now have a population of obnoxious yuppies from the likes of Iowa, who have never lived in a city, think they run shit because they pull 100k from BAH, with a poor mostly black population being forced out and being treated like a nuisance...and...surprised pikachu....these groups are clashing. 

I spent my time living EOTR (deanwood) and I would be lying if I were to say there wasn't crime, some of which we fell victim to, But there was also a sense of community, people watching out for each other, friendly neighbors who welcomed us. It meant that there was still some semblance of balance and togetherness that prevented the downward spiral that areas like u/14th are seeing.

h5tjyy6,onh55q,brendanode,"I know a lot of people have chipped in with useful advice but I thought I’d share my experience anyways because it feels relevant 

I was involved in a traffic accident where I wasn’t at fault. I t-boned a car as he tried to make a left turn in front of me and failed to yield. After getting out of my car (I was thankfully ok despite some whiplash) the driver of the car at fault decided to chase me down and attack me, unprovoked except being convinced I caused the crash. He grabbed me from behind and punched my head while I was face down on the ground. A traffic cop witnessed this and pulled him off of me. I was transported from the scene to a hospital and while in the ambulance a police officer asked if I wanted to press charges and I said yes - he shouldn’t get away with violently reacting like that. 

After several weeks of fear given he had my name and address from the citation I was finally able to get ahold of the detective assigned to my case who informed me they decided not to pursue charges. Despite a cop witnessing and this guy having a pretty long rap sheet they felt it wasn’t worth their time. When I asked why they weren’t pushing on prosecuting this guy who committed a violent crime they told me they “didn’t have an answer that would satisfy me”. My alternatives were to sue him myself or let it go, which I did since I just wanted the ordeal behind me. 

I’m not saying this will be your outcome but know they’re apparently working with such limited resources they can opt to not do anything, so just prepare for that possibility.

Policing across the US is pretty much down to video now.  We all like to think that ""detective"" means someone who will actually look for clues ala Sherlock Holmes.

How do I know? Three home invasions (back in my hometown) by the same gang of juveniles, already known to the police.  Lazy legwork by detectives who told me that if I'd had cameras on the property they'd be able to do something. Eventually (because criminals are stupid) they fucked themselves by using one of my stolen guns in another crime.

I recommend calling the sergeant again and asking whether they are the direct supervisor of the detective(s) or whether the latter answer to a detective sergeant and/or shift supervisor.  I'd also ask to be put into contact with the sergeant's lieutenant (or equivalent direct line supervisor).

h5sh37e,onh55q,,"My wife had an incident with one of the train masturbators about a month ago, and the responding cop said if you are travelling alone at off-peak hours, only sit in the very first car of the train, and barring that, pick the most crowded one. If you want to be even safer, only ride newer trains (with cameras, I assume). So, I guess do that if they aren't gonna make it safer themselves.

Edit: As someone who can't work from home and has been commuting this whole time, IMO the Metro has gotten relatively back to normal during rush hour. Back in February or so, it was pretty sketchy even during peak hours.

k1t6y7h,16pl9ai,winkinglurker,"It hasn’t been mentioned yet but the West End should be considered.  For a loose boundary, I am thinking of the blocks between Washington Circle and DuPont Circle and those between New Hampshire and Rock Creek Park.  Studios are common and may or may not come with a slightly higher price point than 2k, (for example, the Savoy apartments are packed with GW students who may sublease cheap).  But there is no better location than the West End to access all those things you want to do in that month.  

From the West End you can easily walk/bike to lots of food and drink options (restaurants, bars, Whole Foods, Trader Joe’s), different neighborhoods, including some that have been mentioned (Georgetown, Foggy Bottom, DuPont Circle),  Mother Nature (Rock Creek Park and the Potomac River), and major, must-see sites (The White House, the Kennedy Center, the Smithsonian Renwick Museum and the portion of the National Mall that has the Lincoln Memorial, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, the Korean Veterans Memorial, Constitutional Gardens and the Watergate Steps that overlook the Potomac River).  

For everything else, metro.  You have easy access to all the train lines except for the green and yellow lines.  But those are only a few stops away and you are unlikely to use them much.  It’s better to be close to the orange/blue/silver lines to not only access places in DC that you may want to see, like the Capitol building, National Zoo, and other Smithsonian museums, but you can also easily visit places in Virginia, like Arlington Cemetery, the Pentagon, the Iwo Jima memorial, and the Pentagon City Costco.

First off, doesn’t matter when you sign your lease, they will ask you to re-sign on a shorter month term the second go around to put you in the summer months where they can then justify major rent increases because the market is more $ then, and they use algorithms. Every year has been huge increases. Next, there’s been a few security situations in the building and most the front desk people just don’t pay attention, don’t look up from their desk, leave the door unlocked. Their advertised fire places have never been functional in the nearly four years I’ve been here. They’ve seemingly started cutting on costs and the hallways elevators have basically no AC. The gym has been left on heat just about every day since spring and gets to like 80 degrees. They replaced the perfectly fine pool chairs with these orange shit ones that don’t recline because the orange ones look better in photos.

l7qorl2,1dafcrg,kneeonball,"Depending on what it is, the most they can reasonably do in most cases is make sure they’re following the law. Anything further can legitimately just be a budget issue that they have to bring up with ownership and the owner can either decide to pay for it or not. Typically budgets are done yearly though, so if it’s a request that has a significant cost, the chances of it being done until that next budget year are lower. 

It’s not necessarily Bozzuto’s fault in this case as a lot of times management companies don’t hold enough power to reasonably change anything. 

Now having a good staff that can relay that to owners is a different question, but it’s still on that owner to okay it or not really. Different ownership groups care different amounts about “extra” things. Your mileage will vary across groups. 

If the ownership group doesn’t want to pay for things, the management group then becomes the “bad guy” and that’s part of what they’re paid for.

If JP Morgan Chase managed all their own buildings, their brand and image get tarnished if things go wrong or they make shitty decisions, but a management company being in the middle takes that off of them for the most part.

Rather that than be rear-ended cause i pulled across 3 lanes of traffic to hit one, causing an accident in the process.

I have to pull evasive maneuvers multiple times a day, *every day*, just to avoid accidents.

OK, and where do you think the culture part comes from?

When Irish and Italian immigrants had little opportunity for big money jobs in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, they tended to join gangs. They decided at a young age that those gangs were the only realistic opportunities they had to acquire a position of status in their society.

The material conditions have a direct effect on a group's culture in a given community. The culture doesn't magically spring up out of nowhere.

When a 14 year old grows up in an area with a lot of asbestos ridden projects, bad schools, and drive-by shootings, THEN they are more likely to think that they have no chance to make it. If they see older siblings or role models not doing well, THEN there will be a greater tendency for them to think they have should just join a gang.

>According to the 2019 New York City NYC Government Poverty Measure, 23.8% of Asians are in poverty by municipal standards. This is the highest rate of all racial/ethnic groupings, which include White, Black, and Hispanic/Any.

Asian immigrants have a history of finding great success in the U.S. The parents persuade their children to believe that they can make it, and they have figures they can point to in order to prove their point. From a young age it's pretty easy for them to understand that they are a more highly regarded minority and that white students tend to see them as stereotypically smart.

What do you mean by disparity? Again your argument isn't very clear. If you're suggesting Asian Americans have better outcomes than African Americans because they work harder and have better cultural norms, then I disagree. First, ""[a substantial cohort of Asian Americans chose to come here and entered the United States with advanced degrees](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2017/04/andrew-sullivans-perpetuation-of-model-minority-and-black-pathology-myths-is-pretty-boring-at-this-point.html)."" This is a significant factor in the disparity.

Second, Asian Americans and African Americans have not had similar experiences in this country over the past 80 years or so. The premise of your argument seems to be that both have faced the same broad economic disadvantages, and therefore you can't blame economic factors when there's a disparity. However, isn't true. [For example](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2017/04/andrew-sullivans-perpetuation-of-model-minority-and-black-pathology-myths-is-pretty-boring-at-this-point.html):

>""During World War II, the media created the idea that the Japanese were rising up out of the ashes \[after being held in incarceration camps\] and proving that they had the right cultural stuff,"" said Claire Jean Kim, a professor at the University of California, Irvine. ""And it was immediately a reflection on black people: Now why weren't black people making it, but Asians were?""  
>  
>These arguments falsely conflate anti-Asian racism with anti-black racism, according to Kim. ""Racism that Asian-Americans have experienced is not what black people have experienced,"" Kim said. ""Sullivan is right that Asians have faced various forms of discrimination, but never the systematic dehumanization that black people have faced during slavery and continue to face today."" Asians have been barred from entering the U.S. and gaining citizenship and have been sent to incarceration camps, Kim pointed out, but all that is different than the segregation, police brutality and discrimination that African-Americans have endured.

Why do you keep talking about New York City lol. It's bizarre. There are vastly more African Americans and Asian Americans living outside NYC then inside. As I've already show you, across the country Asian Americans have a lower poverty rate than African Americans. 

>I am not sure we can divorce historical discrimination with AA culture.

So you're essentially saying discrimination results in poor outcomes which is the entire point lol. Also the discrimination faced by African Americans is not historic in nature, it's present.

>Regardless, for the poorest minority in NYC, Asians have far better outcomes - which shows that economic factors alone do not explain poor outcomes. Which is not even a controversial opinion, so I'm not sure why you are acting so defensive.

Except I've repeatedly demonstrated that economic and structural factors are the key determinate to explaining why African Americans are often more disadvantaged, not culture. Further evidence: [Black two parent households have half the net worth of white single parent households](https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2017/02/08/514105689/black-latino-two-parent-families-have-half-the-wealth-of-white-single-parents).

>I never said this. This is an entire strawman of what I wrote that you made up in your own head. To repeat again, I'm not making an argument beyond the fact that we can't just handwave away crimes simply based on ""economic factors"" of the perpetrators.

Okay well your initial post seems to indicate that culture, and not structural economic factors, is the prime determinate of outcomes, but people are afraid to say this because they don't want to seem racist:

>I often see this answer and it is pretty reductionist considering there are various working class groups who work a ton and still manage to have positive outcomes...I think the idea that economics or capitalism results in working class folks not able to properly raise children is generally a cop-out leftists use to cowardly hand-wave away a discussion about culture because they don't want to appear big-yikes-sweaty-racist.

g4vn81o,iqqe85,classicalL,I expect the rental market to implode followed by the housing market when renting becomes enough cheaper than owning and people start to sell houses. Right now there is a lot of demand for house because people want single family homes out of harms way (if they have a job and the means) but that pool is limited so its reasonable to expect a big housing contraction in next year or so when things shake out but unemployment remains high. The real eviction crisis is only just starting given all the freezes. The landlords who are greedy and kick out all their tenants are going to find they have no way to fill their empty units; better to get an IOU that is enforceable at a lower rate than to have a empty unit now. If we are all lucky we might get a vaccine in Dec/Jan and really see it take hold by March and as the spring comes we might see things starting to return to normal and with that a big boom in jobs in the service sectors that got shut down if enough capital can be put out to jump start all those businesses.

The rental market for housing seems to be behaving somewhat similar to commercial/retail right now. 

Namely, from a business perspective, if you can swing debt service/maintenance/etc, especially for luxury/new construction, it usually makes sense to leave property empty than to rent for less.

One of the main reasons (and this is likely some of the fallout from DC's even more tenant friendly than normal actions during all of this), is that it's worth staying empty to find the right tenant.

g50s5tg,iqqe85,,"No one here is arguing the right wants a civil war.  No one rational wants one.  The point is that a disputed election creates a prisoner's dilemma problem for both sides.  Everyone knows that a civil war is the worst outcome, but lack of trust can make steps toward it rational, until oops, both sides have gone too far and it happens.  

Relying on greed to stop the right is nuts.  In a disputed election neither rightwing leaders, nor, more importantly, their voters (whose opinions you are completely discounting - and most of them are not rich), are going to just roll over and let the Democrats have power.  Particularly when their leader, who has cult-like support from 40% of the country tells them they're being robbed.  So, Republican leaders will line up behind him, hoping that Dems roll over.  But Dems will actually be being robbed (if it comes to this) and their supporters will be outraged also, so they won't roll over.  The radical left will take to the streets, supported by protests the size of which dwarf anything this country has ever seen.  The radical right, armed, will come out in opposition to them, people will die, and the police and the military will get involved to try to quell the disturbances engulfing any place with large populations, or divided populations.  Given the degree the far right has infiltrated and co-opted many police departments and the military, they'll have a natural advantage.  On the other hand, military leaders will see Trump as dangerous and will recognize that he is ending democracy here...so who knows.  

The idea that this is certain to go badly is of course wrong - odds are the election isn't even close.  Or Trump could win legitimately.

What the far left doesn't get, on the other hand, is that you can have a basically capitalist system with a robust safety net and robust efforts to price externalities, prevent or price regulate monopolies, and the like, while still having a much more productive economy than you would if you had a non-capitalist system.

I always like to note how every Scandinavian country has more billionaires per capita than the U.S..

Also, how this starts matters.  If Trump clearly lost, then yes, it's over like that no matter what he says because neither the military nor the rest of the executive branch will follow him, and at that point, seeing it's hopeless, Republicans in Congress will abandon him too.  

But if Trump is ahead on election night (because tons of Dems vote absentee), and there are some vote counting errors/disputes/very close key areas/credible allegations of hacking (in either direction), etc. - something that makes the election plausibly disputable, even if it's likely Biden won, then think what will happen:  Liberals will take to the streets, and some of them will be angry enough to break things, riot, etc. (a small minority probably, but it will be played up the Republicans and in media).  Trump will order the military out to restore order, and...MAYBE... a few military leaders will resign, but the military as a whole won't refuse to obey orders, because they won't clearly be illegal, unconstitutional, or an outright attempt to illegally hold on to power.  So the military will turn out.  That will enrage liberals more, and certain pro-violence types on all sides (not just liberals, but boogaloos, and rightwing terrorists) will either turn out to combat each other or as a false flag to increase support for a crackdown on liberal protestors.  Republicans will at the same time go to work in the courts to try to shutdown counting in a way that favors them, and their judicial appointees, already biased in favor of Republicans, and feeling the pressure of a nation in incredibly serious crisis will favor them with radical decisions that the judges justify to themselves with the need to resolve this quickly and decisively.

Democrats won't take this lying down, because, objectively, while the counts have not been completed or completed fairly, so no one knows for 100% who won the election, math suggests that Biden very likely did in the electoral college and did decisively in the popular vote.  Nancy Pelosi declares herself the legitimate President as of Jan. 21 until and if the vote counting can be fairly completed.  Trump and the Republicans have already claimed he won, or that, at a minimum, the House must decide the election between Trump and Biden, using the Constitutional procedure where each state gets one vote (and thus Trump would win, despite Dems having a majority of representatives).  

The idea that the military would definitely say with one voice ""Biden is President"" or ""Pelosi is President"" or ""Trump is President"" is wrong.  The situation I described is muddled and anyone can make an argument for their side.  The military doesn't simply go with Biden because he would be a better President - they've stumbled into a situation that they didn't want to be in, don't know what to do, don't know what orders are legitimate, don't know who should legitimately be giving them orders, and don't agree with themselves on any of it.",1,2020,9,2,1,0

I don’t know how much she paid in rent but she had a roommate. It looked like a really clean and exciting community. I already knew I liked visiting Navy Yard for ball games and kayaking, Swizzler and La Famosa!

Inspired, when my lease was up in Brookland, I looked into a few buildings there. But it’s not rent-controlled, and I’ve been bamboozled by that before; plus, I prefer having a landlord I can text than an online portal for emergencies. I have a gym at my office and I can’t really swim, so the amenities aren’t for me. 

And, this isn’t meant as a dig on anybody or anyone’s taste, but it felt a little too Disneyland Main Street USA to live there if that makes sense. It’s just not for me.

I think look at other places in other neighborhoods - there are def places that have similar rents if that’s your most important criteria - and then return. The really good thing about any of those places is there are always units available, so don’t rush the decision.

If rent and amenities are the most important things to you, and you don’t mind crossing the river, there are similar buildings & vibes (in my humble opinion!) in Rosslyn and Crystal City and around there. You might even be able to find something bigger and/or cheaper since you’re out of the city.

On Neighborhood Scout’s website, you can see the exact numbers they’re using (or at least the numbers they would be using if they made the map today). [Neighborhood Scout reports a violent crime rate of 9.84 per 1,000 people in DC.](https://www.neighborhoodscout.com/dc/washington/crime) It’s hard to tell from the map which city is supposed to be #50, but looking at some of the lighter yellow points on the map, we have:

- [Myrtle Beach](https://www.neighborhoodscout.com/sc/myrtle-beach/crime) (12.16/1,000 pop violent crime rate)

- [Stockton](https://www.neighborhoodscout.com/ca/stockton/crime) (12.59)

- [Baton Rouge](https://www.neighborhoodscout.com/la/baton-rouge/crime) (11.93)

If you want to question Neighborhood Scout’s methodology, you can find a description of their methodology on their website and see if you think there’s some reason it would lead to incorrect results.

It’s interesting to note that DC is in the list of top 100 most dangerous, at #80. If you want to know how the data is sourced + analyzed, there is an explanation here - https://www.neighborhoodscout.com/faq/top100dangerous

I think it’s important to look at statistics instead of gut feelings when looking for the truth.

DC comes in at 140 with a violent crime rate of 7.45 per 1000 population.

That said, I'm getting a different list than they did because they used 2021 data. Which is why, when using UCR data, you typically want to pull five years of UCR data and average over the five years, because especially in smaller jurisdictions (which you'll note make up a lot of the cities listed) one year of higher crime due to some non-repeating factor (burglary spree, etc) can drive a city up in the rankings beyond its typical spot.

If you look at the data for homicides per year, the numbers are 2023 -> 254 vs 2021 -> 226 (12% increase in 2 years)

Sex abuse numbers are 2023 -> 154 vs 2021 -> 181 (15% decrease in 2 years)

Statistically 2021 looks slightly better/worse than 2023 in all areas except for robbery, which appears to have had a significant increase.

I think the real issue is that you don't want criminals to be held accountable. I can't think of any other reason you'd deny the thousands of victims of violent crimes existence.

kcuwhod,18ewlpw,harkuponthegay,"It depends on what you mean by “size”.

According to the census bureau Richmond has a total area of 62 sq mi (160 km2), of which 60 sq mi (160 km2) is land and 2.7 sq mi (7.0 km2) (4.3%) is water. Meanwhile, DC has a total area of 68.34 square miles (177 km2), of which 61.05 square miles (158.1 km2) is land and 7.29 square miles (18.9 km2) (10.67%) is water. 

So both places are almost identical in terms of square miles of land— now take Richmond’s murders and spread them over that space and you get about 1 murder per square mile. But if you take DC’s murders and spread them over its space you get 4.20 murders per square mile. 

Meaning that in DC you are much more likely to have had a murder committed within one square mile of where you live during the year than if you lived in Richmond. Which makes it feel far less safe to some people. 

And that brings up an interesting distinction— which city feels less safe and which city actually is less safe? The answer is not as obvious as dividing murders by population— because in reality it is highly dependent upon who you are. 

The people that are being murdered are overwhelmingly young black men of lower socioeconomic status. So if you are a black man living in wards 7 or 8 these numbers mean something different to you than if you are a white woman living in ward 2.",-3,2023,12,2,1,"1, 4"

ly3iwh4,1gvokxm,housemaster22,"As a first time home buyer I would ask yourself this before trying to buy this property “do I really want to be a homeowner.” You say that you are exhausted by renting, but honestly owning a property isn’t that much better. There is still lots of money you have to invest into the property to maintain it not including the money that you will need to invest as soon as you buy it. Have you gotten those repairs quoted yet? How handy are you and your husband? If you can do even little fixes you will save a lot of money. I personally don’t think the DC housing market is as stable as everyone thinks, especially in developing areas without strong schools, so there is a chance that your home value could drop. 5 years is usually the amount of time it takes for homeownership to be better financially than renting. Are you going to be/do you want to be in DC for 5 more years? Do you want children? If so when and how is the school in your area? What I am saying is that homeownership plants you there for much longer than renting does. 

You will now be responsible for renting out the basement and maintaining to a higher standard than what the previous owners had since you will literally lord over the tenant. DC tenant laws are very strict. You will need to set up a business to rent out to tenants, it isn’t particularly difficult but it does cost money. You will also need to set up a way to process their rent, which unless they are paying check or cash, usually involves another cost. Since they are in your basement, be prepared to deal with them over every minor issue and be absolutely sure that you want to rent to them. Because they will walk up and knock on your door if there is a problem. Remember, you can’t just leave the apartment now and move to another place if you don’t like your neighbors.

ly8xbqu,1gvokxm,Independent_One2052,"Hello, I’m a DC realtor, lender, homeowner, and landlord.

First, TOPA - no it does not fall under TOPA anymore unless there are 4+ units or someone is elderly or disabled.  The law changed, whereas every tenant used to have topa rights and there was a bit of a process to comply with the law it is pretty simple now. You are required to send them a form notifying them if they are elderly or disabled they have TOPA rights but assuming they are not, that is all and as long as they do not assert their rights as elderly or disabled TOPA Is moot.

Second, programs.. yes the most common is DC’s HPAP .. however it is income restricted so if you make too much it would not be available.  The max income for a 2 person household to receive any assistance is $136,100 so if you gross over that it’s out.  If you are DC government employees there is the EAHP which offers less assistance but otherwise is the same program for DC employees and can be combined with HPAP.  The big downside to the HPAP is that it comes with the stipulation that the home remains your primary residence so if you want to upgrade or move away, selling is your only option to keep things on the up and up vs a normal loan you can move out and rent it and make it an investment property in the future.  The HPAP is also not a grant, but a deferred no interest loan so your initial payment will go up once the deferral period ends.  There are other programs out there, DC open doors, lender sponsored DPA, etc but what I tell people is generally there’s no free lunch.  If you have a minimum down payment and decent credit a traditional loan is usually the way to go.  The only exception to that “no free lunch” rule is sometimes there are actual grants, they typically come with stipulations such as you must buy in certain zip codes, make under certain incomes etc to where they don’t work for most people.

FHA loans - generally the main downside of the FHA loans are the up front mortgage insurance which I tell clients “are essentially points”.  The upfront premium is 1.75% and the minimum down payment for a standard fha loan is 3.5% so you put down 3.5% but initially owe 98.25%.  (There are 0% down options that come with lender overlays but the interest rate gets jacked up so most people find them unattractive unless the minimum down payment is truly not doable) Another downside is you cannot get rid of the monthly mortgage insurance without doing a refinance (unlike conventional loans).  This aspect is less of a detractor now than it was a couple years ago as everyone is expecting rates to drop and bring able to refinance, however, no guarantees .  Generally FHA loans are best for buyers with sub-700 credit that can’t get approved for conventional loans or where the rate is too high on conventional due to their fico or dti.

In terms of being a landlord DC Is very tenant friendly so my best advice is to always screen, screen, and screen some more for good tenants because a bad tenant can be a nightmare and nearly impossible to get out quickly and affordably.     It is far better to leave the rental vacant for a couple months and continue searching for a quality tenant than to rent it to the first sub par applicant that comes along IMO.  

 In terms of keeping everything on the “up and up” you will need a rental license (BBL) from the city if the basement is an entirely separate unit.  If it is a completely separate unit and the current owner does not have a BBL it’s an “illegal rental” which sounds scary but honestly the city generally is not cracking down on them, however it could still bite you if you need to take the tenant to court.  In fact since it appears the whole house is rented there really should be a minimum of 1 BBL, if not 2 depending how the house and leases are configured.  There could be a reason such as ceiling height below 7’, lack of egress or another reason it can’t be approved.. just so you’re aware.  A lot of government/military are very concerned with having everything legal so otherwise identical houses, one with a legal basement rental and the other with an illegal basement rental can be valued a bit differently.. so it affects marketability.  Separate utility metering is another item that most basement rentals do not have but improves value if it does.

To legally rent out your basement apartment in DC, you’ll need two things:

1. **Basic Business License (BBL).** This is a document that basically ensures the safety of both you and your renter by giving you the right to do business (yes, even if you’re just operating as a landlord in your own home!).
2. **Certificate of Occupancy.** This is a document that verifies your unit is safe for renting. To obtain this certificate, you’ll need to have your basement pass inspection; otherwise, your rental will be considered illegal. You must have a Certificate of Occupancy before you can get a BBL.

To pass inspection, your basement apartment will need a few things. First, the ceilings will need to be at least seven feet high (for habitable spaces), have two ways of safely exiting the apartment, and have separate heating and cooling.

If the house is already leased then there is nothing to decide unless their lease expires as those do convey. In terms of topa that no longer applies if the landlord only manages a few units so not guaranteed. If you’re interested you should message the current owner as it might save them tens of thousands in realtor fees if they know you’re interested and could help with negotiations.

1) DC has a suite of first time homebuying programs with varying restrictions and hoops to jump through. I purchased through DC Open Doors about 5 years back. I've heard it isn't as great of a deal now, but I really don't know enough. Some banks also offer promotional, first-time home buyer loans that are portfolio loans (as opposed to conventional vs. FHA), depending on things like the census tract you're buying in. Talk to a mortgage lender who is familiar with all these programs-- I recommend someone at First Home Mortgage.

2) I don't think the tenant in your ADU actually qualifies for TOPA tenant rights, but I could be wrong here. I also rent a condo out and have talked to a realtor about selling it in the past; in my case, the tenant doesn't qualify for TOPA rights, but the realtor was concerned about the extra steps involved when selling a unit that's occupied-- particularly on the title side of things. 

3) Speaking of being a landlord, DC makes it rather easy to register as a business and be a single-unit landlord. It's not terribly expensive either. But it a whole extra set of things to care about-- from taxes to licensing to handling repairs, tenant issues, etc. YMMV renting out an ADU, but I really don't make much of anything on the condo I rent out after everything (HOA, insurance, savings for repairs, etc.) is all paid out.",1,2024,11,2,1,0

* Living in Georgetown proper is your best bet here, despite the cost, simply due to how difficult it is to commute

**University of the District of Columbia**

* Bethesda is a good option because of metro access

* Adams Morgan is a little pricy but could be a good place to look

Proximity to red line- NoMa, Cleveland Park, DuPont Circle, and Logan Circle are popular with young people with lively social scenes but are probably less racially and socially diverse.

She said no, and then Cooper shot a warning shot into the ceiling — which led to Mahoney running into the hall.

e17074z,8tcmdd,DCahhjeez,"I live right where your looking to buy. We have been renting around hill east and h street area for the past decade. I feel safer here then I did living directly behind h and 13th, mainly because theres less drunk foot traffic. The neighbors are friendly and a good mix of old and new, get to know them well. The police are actively showing much more presence, you will actually have a cop sitting on 18th and h just about all day and all night.  They also have two or three patrol cars sitting at the starburst corner just about every night and it’s made a significant difference in not just feeling safer but also much less trash flying around.  
One thing to consider though is  schooling especially if your looking to purchase. it’s less then desirable for your feed school. You could go through the lottery  but it’s no guarantee.

e19lowp,8tcmdd,Sonny_Phono,It's fine. It's a great geographic location and the neighborhood is only getting better. I bought in the 1900 block of H street 8 years ago this Fall and have never had any real problems. Every month there are more and more new residents moving in and quite a few of them pushing baby strollers. ,1,2018,6,2,1,"1, 8"
e19syj5,8tcmdd,bshamster1,"My wife and I purchased a home in Carver-Langston about 6 months ago, here is our take. The neighborhood is pretty quiet compared to where we used to live in Eckington. We live on 20th, and it is very, very quiet, hardly any foot or car traffic except for locals. 19th Street seems to be a little nosier since it is the entrance to the neighborhood from the bus and street car, it is also a through street up to Maryland avenue; also 19th and Benning is a pretty active corner. Our neighbors are very friendly and are mix of an older generation who have lived here for years and a younger generation moving in. 

We frequently go out on H street and feel safe walking to the street car or bus to go out. However like some already mentioned we almost always grab an uber/lyft home instead of walking home from the street car when we stay out late at night.

We do hear the occasional gun shots at night, but they are usually east on 21st Street. We feel we got good value for the home we bought compared to similar size houses in neighborhoods we could no longer afford. One thing I could not recommend enough for any neighborhood you choose to move to, get active in the ANC.

Still, while I can almost guarantee I’ll go to B&W the next time I’m in DC, the following scenario doesn’t seem very reasonable:

On 8/31/2021 I paid $4.40 for a strawberry cupcake at B&W, excluding tax (verified by an emailed receipt).  Today, that same cupcake costs $5.80—which represents a 32% increase in less than a year.",3,2022,8,2,1,0
