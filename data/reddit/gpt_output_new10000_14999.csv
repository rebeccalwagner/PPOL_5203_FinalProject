>Abstract

>Noise is unwanted and/or harmful sound, first recognized as a public health hazard in 1968. The Noise Control Act of 1972 declared that ‚Äúit is the policy of the United States to promote an environment for all Americans free from noise that jeopardizes their health or welfare.‚Äù The promise of that legislation remains unfulfilled 50 years later. Human exposure to harmful noise levels is widespread. Major sources include transportation, military aircraft and combat operations, noisy recreational vehicles, industrial machinery, recreational and leisure activities, outdoor power equipment, consumer products, and, possibly, wind turbines. Loud noise causes hearing loss and tinnitus and can contribute to non-auditory health problems. Chronic noise, even at low levels, can cause annoyance, sleep disruption, and stress that contribute to cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, metabolic disturbances, exacerbation of psychological disorders, and premature mortality. Noise interferes with cognition and learning, contributes to behavior problems, and reduces achievement and productivity. The health of more than 100 million Americans is at risk, with children among the most vulnerable. Noise-related costs range in the hundreds of billions of dollars per year. Yet, the United States has no federal standards for non-occupational noise exposure. Federal standards for occupational noise exposure from the 1970s address only hearing loss as an adverse health effect and do not apply to all workers (e.g., those in agriculture and construction). Calls for action have gone largely unheeded.",24,2022,3,2,1,0

i1vkvjd,tkyf41,saltyjohnson,"I agree with you generally, except FAA regs tend to avoid the word ""shall"" when it comes to dictating how a pilot operates their aircraft. FAA regs are very clear that the [pilot in command is the final authority as to the operation of their aircraft](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-91#p-91.3(a)). Even if a pilot deviates from a direct instruction from ATC, the only thing that the pilot ""shall"" do is notify ATC of the deviation and their next intentions as soon as possible. That's not to say that there won't be disciplinary actions taken against the pilot if an investigation finds that the deviation wasn't prudent, but that stuff waits until the pilot is on the ground so they can focus on operating their aircraft.

Thus, ""expected to"" is nearly equivalent to the word ""shall"" except that it leaves the window open for the pilot to deviate if they feel it's necessary. ""Expected to"" means that if ATC clears you to operate along a given route and does not state a specific altitude, you are cleared to operate at the maximum altitude charted. Again, if the pilot feels they must deviate for some reason, they are within their rights to do so. ""Shall"" would be more appropriate in the case of ""A pilot shall not enter prohibited area P-56"" because if you violate that direction, you're liable to be subject to lethal force. However, 14 CFR 73 still doesn't even say ""shall not"", rather sticking with what I'd think to be less severe [""you may not""](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-E/part-73/subpart-C/section-73.83) language.",4,2022,3,2,1,0

We included some of your comments in this story. Here's a little preview of our list, written by Sophia Solano:***

Perhaps more than anything else in this fractured world, pizza is a point of consensus. It‚Äôs perfect for a kid‚Äôs birthday bash or an on-the-go lunch between calls, as well-suited to grace a silver platter at a fancy cocktail party as it is plopped on a paper towel for a whirl in the microwave. Everyone, it seems, can agree on pizza.

Unless you live in D.C.

Around here, pizza is very, very divisive.

Our city ‚Äî littered with New York and Midwestern transplants who have strong opinions on what makes a respectable pie ‚Äî has never gained a reputation as a great pizza town. While other cities get entire styles named in their honor, we get the crumbs.

Despite all that, there is truly great pizza in the DMV ‚Äî if you know where to look. We set out on a journey to find it, with our readers at the wheel.

What follows is a list of the best pizza joints in the Washington area, based on the opinions that matter most: those of our readers. Next time you‚Äôre hungry for pizza, seek out one of these shops. Their pies are as delicious as they come; we‚Äôre sure you‚Äôll agree.

***20: We, the Pizza***

The original Capitol Hill shop, frequented by school and tour groups, has grown to include We, the Pizza locations as near as Arlington and as far as Clearwater Beach, Fla. In addition to dozens of dining options (including a divisive honey ham and pineapple pie), the sodas are crafted with homemade syrups, and the Ballston location offers gelato shakes.

‚ÄúWe The Pizza is my favorite,‚Äù wrote one Reddit user. ‚ÄúTheir Ultimate Cheese \[tomato sauce, fontina, taleggio and mozzarella\] with the pesto oil drizzle makes my heart all a-flutter.‚Äù

***19: Jumbo Slice Pizza Mart***

There‚Äôs a misconception among the young and, well, drunk that ‚Äújumbo slice‚Äù refers to any of the several pizza joints dotting the streets of Adams Morgan after midnight on a weekend. It‚Äôs no wonder ‚Äî the term even has its own Wikipedia page. But only one restaurant, if you‚Äôre kind enough to call it so, actually holds the name ‚ÄúJumbo Slice.‚Äù Whether our polled readers referred to that stop or its greasily delicious posers remains a mystery. Even those who jumped into a discussion on the best Washington pizza expressed some ambiguity: ‚ÄúI think Jumbo Slice, right?‚Äù wrote a Reddit user who asked to be identified as Mike D. ‚ÄúOr is it just because it‚Äôs usually 2 a.m. when I‚Äôm eating it? I don‚Äôt really know.‚Äù

***18: Della Barba***

Most pizzerias stick to making just one or two styles of pie. But Della Barba, a former Union Kitchen start-up, proves that more options does not mean less attention to detail. Founder (and former defense attorney) Joey Barber offers four types of pies in the styles native to Detroit, New York, Chicago and your own oven, otherwise known as ‚Äúnonna‚Äù or ‚Äúgrandma-style.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt sleep on the nonna crust,‚Äù wrote Post reader Karen Wilson Roman. ‚ÄúBut all the crusts are delicious.‚Äù

jyp8stt,1678db3,Additional-Tap8907,I think comparing New York slice joints to Neapolitan wood-fired is an apples and oranges comparison.

jyp3wp3,1678db3,,"Thoughts as a self-professed pizza guy who's had most of the pizza on this list at one time or another:

1. Omission of Slice Joint undermines the credibility of the list (disclaimer: I've never had it, but everyone I know that has had said it's #2 after Andy's in DC, if not #1).
2. Omission of Red Light (over Emmy Squared) for their Detroit Style pizza is a subjective borderline objective mistake.
3. 2 Amy's is overrated but good Neapolitan.
4. Pupatella at 6th is (I think pretty subjectively) baffling, just cannot understand why people like Pupatella it's been extremely mediocre and floppy every time I've had it.
5. Ledo's deserves to be 7th.

I think the main issue with DC bagels is that they are often too white in appearance (whether that is them being under baked or not boiled long enough, IDK).\* Other minor differences I've noticed is that maybe ours are too dry as dough - the best NYC bagels I've had are still very good untoasted b/c the interior is moist and plump. The latter is maybe the only other difference I've noticed - some of our bagels are somewhat flat and look like there's a combination of too little dough and/or not enough leavening. People there also think the specific water they use is a big deal, but my palate isn't sensitive enough to detect that subtle of a difference.

\*Exception here is maybe Bagel Uprising in Del Ray, which has more like a bread crust exterior, but that's also different from what I'm talking about.

I know miami has ‚Äúa ton of black people‚Äù, but with neighborhoods and sprawl, it can easily feel different on the ground (where I was, for more than three straight months, living in Brickell and Little Havana). In DC, African American / Black demo is 41%, and in Miami it is 16%. That is‚Ä¶ not a significant share. Black population in miami is usually carribean immigrant communities that settled in the north of the metro area.

Miami isn‚Äôt even ON THIS LIST. There‚Äôs one Miami Dade County suburb, 18 miles north of Miami. But that‚Äôs not what you were saying.

Does this mean that it's okay to hurl racial epithets at Asian folks? No, it doesn't. But racism or more precisely white supremacy attempts to leverage Asians against Black folks through the ""model minority"" myth and seeks to play us off of each other. 

In this way, a number of Asian folks (not all) are able to benefit from their relative proximity to whiteness and as part of this tradeoff frequently dabble in antiblackness. 

I suggest the folks in this thread talking about how in DC Black folks are ""the most racist"" would learn a lot from actually reading social science research/theory on white supremacy and bias instead of parroting the white supremacist talking points that come so easily to mind.

It's not an argument, the fact of the matter is DCs population, particularly the non black population has surged in the past 15 years, and the black population has declined substantially. It is literally a bunch of outsiders moving in and you can tell by half the posts on reddit. 85% of them is people talking about how they have trouble meeting new people, how everyone they meet is in politics, how the people they know also moved here from somewhere else, or asking questions about basic DC things that natives and non-outsiders find obvious.

I had a similar incident when a man started to speed walk down the escalator to stand just right beside me. He then tried to raise his arm in front of me, holding a bag of some sort in his hand. When I noticed this I took a quick look back only to see him staring at me without saying a single word. Creepy as fuck.

I'm sure now that it's probably a case of mental illness, and really god knows what he would've done if I waited any longer. I threw away all pretext of civility and just booked it down the escalator and reported him to the first station agent I saw. The guy then finally started talking and raised a huge attitude about ""whatever the hell"" I had told the station agent. 

I managed to slip away as the station agent tried to calm down the man in order to defuse the situation, but it was very disturbing. I never thought that I'd have to run away from something while living in DC, makes me glad that I was wearing running shoes as I was on my way for a jog around the Mall.

Regardless, the person who scratched the car showed lack of respect for another persons property. Why not just leave a note venting whatever they have to say instead of etching in their car?

What ProTimFanning said is exactly what I was going to say to your question. With body panels being made out of fiberglass, aluminum, and carbon fiber (such as Z06) it is a much tougher process to correct dents and scratches. Sometimes when dealing with things like carbon fiber it just is not fixable.  Also, nowadays most body shops just replace the whole body panel instead of trying to do paint correction for deep scratches to bare metal or really bad dents.

If you want to learn more about the process of fixing a keyed car this video is very in depth and good. If you don't watch the whole video the first two mins should give you an idea the labor intensive process of fixing something like this.

hs8t0qu,s1dcqo,ManitouWakinyan,"The specificity is important - to some degree, it makes sense that a decision-maker might be biased against pursuing charges because an institution they are deeply connected to is at risk. As we start getting farther away from that, the bias starts to make less sense, or be less impactful. Are you really saying that Kanter is refusing to pursue charges because some of his staff are alumni of the institutions that are breaking the law? And if so, who is that? His deputies? One of them has a UPenn degree, sure - but the one in charge of criminal enforcement has his JD from the University of Alabama. Maybe his Director of Enforcement. She got her BA from UPenn, yes - but her JD is from Tulane. Or maybe the chief of the Civil Operations unit, who has degrees from Catholic and Trinity. 

Basically:

1. Civil servants have a lower rate of top-ranked universities than you'd expect (most of those graduates go into the private sector)
2. Contrary to what you said, not every relevant leader here went to an elite university - relatively few of them did, particularly in this administration
3. Even as we consider that there might be a lot of staff, kids, etc. who go or went to Ivy Leagues, the proposed bias gets weaker and weaker. I don't know about you, but if I were a lawyer in the antitrust division, and we were pursuing a lawsuit against the alma mater that I owed a few grand in student loans to, I wouldn't hesitate to bring the hammer down. Of course, I doubt my boss or bosses' boss would care. And given ethical rules, I'd expect that if my son went to a university we were targeting, I wouldn't be placed on that case. 
4. This doesn't mean that universities don't know how to protect themselves, or that they don't have powerful lobbyists. I think the basic point that elite universities are well-connected and resourced, and that helps protect them is a good one. But I think you can make that point without resorting to sweeping generalizations and untrue claims. My hope is that this pushback lets you strengthen your point in future, and helps sharpen the case against the kind of behavior these schools are being sued over.",6,2022,1,2,1,0
hsac1iv,s1dcqo,superdookietoiletexp,"I would be interested in seeing it play out. There is a very cosy relationship between the upper echelons of the US government and elite universities, particularly the policy schools that routinely hand out sinecures to newly unemployed politicians and their advisors between cycles. Whether that affects decisions made at DoJ is a moot point, I agree. The lobbying is probably more of a factor; another perhaps even more powerful is the role that HYPS et al. (and their reputation) serve in the projection of American soft power. Ultimately, it would be a very brave prosecutor in any administration other than Trump's that decided to take down their false claims to some meritocratic ideal.

> ""We feel that we ... have been absolutely abandoned by the city,"" McDonnell had written in his email. ""The crime and safety issues in that neighborhood are out of control.""
***
> In the original email, McDonnell detailed how his employees had been punched, pepper sprayed, had guns and knives pulled on them, spit on, and had to watch as ""customers have literally tried to kill each other."" He added that one of their employee's sons, who worked nearby, was robbed and murdered ‚Äì leaving his team distraught about the loss and about the situation in the neighborhood.

> ""All of the above needs to be understood in the context of the lack of police presence. There is none,"" McDonnell wrote. ""Once upon a time there was. 911 calls, if they come at all, take 15-20 minutes. When they do arrive, it seems as if they feel they can‚Äôt do anything.""

After WUSA9 found out about this and contacted the management, the management released a public letter saying it was happy with how it's addressing this. In the best case scenario, crime was actually terrible but Clyde's is genuinely happy with the efforts to address that. In the worst, the private communication is how Clyde's actually feels, and the statement of praise that was released immediately after the September letter was a face saving measure (perhaps not to upset the government, perhaps not to scare away patrons). If you're going by the idea that we can't trust what corporations are saying publicly, as it's just a way for them to get public opinion to go in the direction they want, I'm not sure why you'd trust the public letter over the private communication.

Chokeholds have always been against MPD policy but the most recent policy re-iterating that has made it against the law to have incidental neck touches. This doesn‚Äôt specify an intended neck touch, but instead, any touch of the neck inducing pressure on them with no measure of degree. This includes pulling of a shirt, brushing against the neck, or any other incidental action causing contact with the neck. This results in an administrative actions putting the members career at risk, a trial board, the member at possibility of criminal charges, and more. A lot of members have already faced suspension over such incidental touches while this most recent policy has been enacted. So why put hands on anyone to effect an arrest or a stop? Why risk your life when almost every other bit of the system is working against law and order?

People have been suspended for this left and right, and it‚Äôs not for what you claim. People get fired or charged for that kind of negligence resulting in death in DC.

The current owner, a speculator, probably snatched this house up for, maybe, $100 grand and hasn't looked at it since.  It's in a not-bad neighborhood, just off S. Dakota Ave., 3 blocks from RI Ave.  It's on a huge lot. It has the potential for adding up and out. The owner is obviously open to offers but Zillow says the payments on the asking price would run $2,300 a month for a two bedroom, two bath house. If it was pretty that would be an attractive purchase for a rental. Except it's not pretty. But I don't see deterioration, just, so far, neglect.

The tipping factor is, of course, the down payment. For the sake of argument lets say the seller will take $400 grand. If so, there's your 20%, on paper, down payment.

If the current market could be considered constant this might be a good investment at $400 grand. But, in my opinion, it's not. The entire area is in a bubble. However, if I had bought it at $100 I'd feel safe as, well, houses.",2,2022,3,2,1,"1, 6"

i0i5rdt,tcxuqv,punkwalrus,"One of my old school chums lived on a property built in the 1920s-30s next to a farm. Back then, it was a cheap parcel of land, a fews acres at most. In the 1950s, the farm around them sold and was developed into a post-war suburban neighborhood, with the standard quarter acre lots. They were smack dab in the middle of where the development wanted to build a road, but they refused, and so one of our main neighborhood streets abruptly ended at the edge of of their property, now heavily wooded, and containing two houses. 

By the late 1980s, the neighborhood started to be gentrified, and as the homes sold off, were razed to the ground and McMansions put in their place. Now about half my old neighborhood are huge homes that are built almost right up to the property line with barely any yard space to speak of. My school chum's parents eventually sold off the property they lived on for some ungodly amount of money based on property alone.  I think several million per acre.

There is a huge drug problem in the homeless population on the west coast, the most vocal of the left spend their time campaigning that ""it is a health problem, not a crime problem.""

That is wearing a left-leaning idea as a fashion accessory, it's virtue signaling.

Maybe, stop closing down psychiatric institutions, possibly open more. What do we do if a person in clear ongoing distress refuses help? What do we do if they become a danger to society?

Where the fuck did I say that?  I'm just not stupid enough to think that giving a junkie a minimum wage job will magically cure them of addiction.  For a lot of people, they're homeless precisely because they're addicts and can't hold a job.  These are the same sort of people who need free narcan that the city provides.

>Do you have semblance of an idea on what personal responsibility means in this world? On what being an adult is? And that yes, eventually, decisions have consequences?

I think you're inferring something from my post that I never said nor ever meant.

My point was that giving a junkie a job and a roof over their head won't do anything.  Junkies either are homeless because they became too addicted and couldn't hold a job or they became homeless through other factors, became addicted to drugs to cope and now can't hold a job.  A lot of these addicts likely don't even want a job, you can't give someone something they don't even want.  I don't know what the solution is because I don't care enough to figure one out, if I had one, I'd run for office.

These people won't become productive members of society until they get clean and/or get treated for their severe mental illness (a person who yells and talks to themselves can't hold a job either...also, and I'm going on a hunch here, they likely wouldn't want a job anyway).

&#x200B;

*""new traffic laws (such as installing speed bumps, police checkpoints at entry/exit points during busy hours, slow zones or pedestrian-only zones)""*

&#x200B;

That solves no problems if anything it would slow down this already slow ass city, we need to create solutions not just put more obstacles down.

If you're mad enough to write about how much you hate it, you're mad enough to email Bowser and tell her there needs to be a park so kids can play on their dirt bikes and get off the city roads.

I've seen kids ride on with their dirt bikes in  BOTH of our neighboring states, both in the streets as well in dirt parks but here in the city they're automatically criminals for doing the same, except while actively being told ""no you can't have the thing you want that would also make smoother traffic while giving these kids somewhere safe for them to ride off city streets.

It's about a constant stream of it over a significant period of time. They themselves are blocking and slowing down traffic, while also endangering every car, driver, cyclist, and pedestrian near them.

Agree that traffic sucks, but there have already been proposals to regulate/charge a toll for access to downtown DC, like they do for central London, to reduce traffic and promote pedestrian access/bicycle usage. So that's why I suggested those options.

Yes, police chases have caused rider deaths, which is why police chases were banned.

But since the car chase ban, there have been multiple incidents of pedestrians being killed or maimed as well as car accidents all caused by illegal off-road vehicle drivers.

The case law that decided this was US v. Antoine Jones and was based on a D.C. case.  The takeaway from that case is that warrants are required to attach a GPS to a suspect vehicle.

I agree with you about the chaos aspect. I don't think they would get as much joy from this if there wasn't the potential danger of getting arrested or intimidating/interrupting other people.

Unfortunately, after all the articles/posts I've read about this issue, I actually do not think that people smarter than us, lawmakers or otherwise, have actually tried to do anything about this. That's what I'm particularly incensed about.

Regarding the traffic cameras, it's the only way that MPD can track down the offenders because of the no chase policy. From what I've read, around 50%+ of these off road vehicles are actually stolen, so it's the only way they can enforce the law. The act of riding illegally in DC streets is a misdemeanor and carries up to a $250 fine (but no one's ever been fined that much), and if they can't pay the $50-$150 that they're typically fined, then it comes with up to a 12 day stint in DC jail, which is again waived because it's a misdemeanor and DC Jails are way overstuffed.

So, if we had the cameras, at minimum we can hope to confiscate illegal/stolen off-roading vehicles.

Or if someone tries to pass a counterfeit $50 bill, a cop being called means they might be shot when the situation escalates.  As a society, we often default to police-based policies, but there are many other options that could help address people's issues without introducing a cop that often defaults to escalation and violence.

It's been rising for a decade now.  226 last year and this year looks to be worse.  So the rate is definitely trending in the wrong direction.  Could it be safe again in 10 years?  Absolutely.

I don't know too much about police assignments, as I'm on the fire side.  In fire, we have no choice on where we are placed, but  we can request transfers.  This results in a lot of younger guys transferring to fire houses east of the river, Trinidad, Shaw, Columbia Heights, Petworth, or where the action is.  They want the experience and are very excited about their job.  Areas in upper NW, like Georgetown or the Palisades, are commonly filled with older guys trying to slow down.

I‚Äôve also done similar activities organized by hostels etc while traveling (for example, a combination bar crawl and scavenger hunt) and I‚Äôve seen bachelorette parties do them as well, but I‚Äôm going to assume neither of these options are correct given the people who approached your friend were sober.

hkvf6du,qv8awv,newredditryyy,"My attempt at comparing neighborhoods in London to DC:

‚Äî Dupont/Kalorama ‚âà Kensington/Notting Hill. With upscale row houses and home to most of the embassies, this is a relatively peaceful/upscale area. Tons of restaurants, bars, shops, and a weekly farmers market kinda gives DuPont a notting hill vibe.

‚Äî Adams Morgan (AdMo) ‚âà Camden. AdMo is pretty hipster/offbeat for DC standards (though not at the level of Takoma Park), with its main stretch on 18th street featuring a wide mix of shops, restaurants, and nightlife. 

‚Äî U Street/Shaw ‚âà Shoredtich. Lots of bars. Like AdMo, this is a top destination for young people to go out on weekends. Good place for live music as well with several of DC‚Äôs top venues (9:30 club, Lincoln Theater).

‚Äî Georgetown ‚âà Knightsbridge. Very posh, known for the University and it being DC‚Äôs shopping hub. With its variety of stores, also reminiscent of SoHo.

‚Äî NoMa/H Street Cordidor ‚âà Brixton. An interesting mix of grit with new developments. Street art and interesting restaurants give the area a creative energy. Also home to Union Market (the closest thing DC has to Borough/Camden). 

‚Äî Navy Yard ‚âà Canary Wharf. Brand new and a little ways out, feels very different from the rest of DC. Surging in development of apartment complexes and restaurants/bars. Not known for being a business hub like Canary Wharf, though; it‚Äôs the home to the Washington Nationals (city‚Äôs baseball team)",56,2021,11,2,1,
hkvn0ha,qv8awv,leffbehind,"Hi OP! As someone who moved from London to DC after grad school I hope I can give you a good perspective of everything here in DC. 

1. DC is *significantly smaller* than London. Anyone who has been to NYC/LA/SF will also tell you this, but from one seat of government to another, you will quickly realize that DC is a tiny fraction of the size of London. However, what's nice is that DC (in some areas) actually seems quite dense and slightly similar to European cities.
2. Public Transit will be good - in the context of transit in the US. European cities have decades of developed infrastructure for folks who don't have cars and the US is very much the opposite. DC however is one of the most walkable cities in the US and there are a host of different public transit options, as long as you are not to snobby to ride the bus (Moving from London where I bussed or tube everywhere I never understood some DC residents' need to turn their nose up at the busses.)
3. For your budget you will have plenty of options and, I would also aim for the West End (not much there, and a bit too close to college students at GW)/Dupont/Kalorama/Adam's Morgan/west of Logan Circle axis. These areas are *relatively* low crime, quiet, walkable, have plenty of shoppes and eateries, and you can meet new people. **However, noise level varies extremely based on the individual unit and the street(s) that it faces.** This is not satisfying, unless you have a buddy here already, but if you can - **tour the unit and linger as long as you can** ***in the unit*** **to accurately gauge the noise level of the individual unit.** I currently live in a building with a gorgeous unit that faces one of the loudest street corners in DC and will be moving next month out of Columbia Heights because of it - yet folks who live on the other side of the building have quiet and serene living spaces.
4. What may appear odd to you and will seem normal to most Americans is how DC, an urban city, has a *completely random arrangement of completely residential blocks* interspersed throughout the city (things like Swann St. NW). These are very cute and if you can manage to find a ground floor (not basement) unit in one of these in your price range, that is the golden ticket.
5. The weather is similar, but on the whole, better than London. The amount of days where it just lightly rains all day long (my most hated part of London) is relatively small. Summers in DC will be more humid and a bit hotter, and I'd actually say the winters are comparable. In general about 15-30% less rain and it's usually harder and quicker in duration.
6. Lots of churches, like, a lot, even considering that London has been inhabited since Roman times, DC has probably 20x the churches of London
7. Dogs Dogs Dogs - DC has very quickly become a city of dog-owners. This is I think a relatively recent advent in DC greatly accelerated by COVID, but there will be many many more dogs here, which I as a pet owner, love.
8. DC residents think they have a lot of rats/mice - they have never lived in London :D.
9. Do not believe anyone who says an ""Irish Bar/pub"" is good in DC, I am yet to find one.
10. U St. is generally too loud and busy, but there are quiet bubbles to be found. 
11. NoMa is still being gentrified/redeveloped in a piecemeal fashion so certain parts of it are very modern (and people love it) and other parts are very urban blight/empty lots/crime - and *it is far from the various other centers of DC young/exciting/interesting life except for the H St. corridor/Eastern Market.* 
12. Now I'll also give you an additional random list of trade offs:
   1. Higher Priced items in DC: 
      1. Theatre/Events tickets - Yes there are opportunities to get free/cheap tickets with good seats, but I went to a massive amount of plays, ballets, musicals, concerts, etc. in London for a nice chunk cheaper than here in DC. 
      2. Gym memberships - These are treated like a luxury good in DC and while there are some that have various tiers of pricing, you will likely get a bit of sticker shock - When I lived in London a new gym opened within 1-3 tube stops every 4-5 months, making pricing competitive. Gyms in DC are run/owned by about 4-6 companies who have no incentive to have competitive pricing (Avoid WSC if you can) -
      3. Healthcare - I will not bore you with the details, but it's a lot more expensive and it's something **you will need to budget for** unless you work at a tech company that pays all your premiums (this is rare, but happens)
   2. Cheaper items in DC
      1. Museums - London is good, but I'd argue that DC's got it beat on the massive volume of free museums/art galleries and the like
      2. **Housing - what you can afford for 2500 in DC will be palatial, modern, clean and in a great neighborhood compared to London flats.**
      3. Groceries - The difference here is not large, but it is enough that you will notice your spend at Harris Teeter/Safeway/Giant is probably slightly cheaper than your standard London Tesco. This scales so M&S prices>Trader Joes, Waitrose prices>Whole Foods
      4. **Utilities - these bills are A LOT cheaper in the US**

Also, yes some of the buildings might appear ‚Äúold‚Äù, but it‚Äôs perfectly fine because most of the apartments are clean and refurbished inside with all the modern equipments.

hkvdv7e,qv8awv,emcee_gee,"I'm the same age as you are. I moved here in August and had the same budget. I do have a car, but I only use it on road trips; not for commuting or other regular activities. I bike and walk a lot and take the Metro when I go in to work. I had visited DC a handful of times over the last decade or so, so I already had a decent idea of the neighborhood vibes.

I chose the U Street area. Not _on_ U Street -- that would be too crazy/loud for me at this point in my life. But close enough that I still get the benefit of all the businesses and nightlife when I want to go out. I chose a condo building that wasn't _super_ new and didn't have all the flashy amenities, but had a relatively strong community of grown adults.

I'd recommend finding a Realtor to help you find a place. They don't generally work with the big property management firms; instead, they help you find individual condos listed by smaller landlords usually with only one or two units (often, places they themselves used to live). I've always been happier renting from individuals than companies; plus, with a Realtor, you get the benefit of having someone who takes the time to get to know you and what you're looking for, rather than having a bunch of 15-minute tours with different listing agents where you've got to ask all the same questions every time and you never really know how honest they're being. Realtors work on commission, generally taking the first month's rent from the landlord, so it doesn't cost you anything.

I work 3 blocks over (Farragut Square area). It's not feasible by walking, but I recommend Alexandria Old Town if bicycling is an option. Has metro access direct to DC, is very, very safe, cute cafes, gorgeous Old Town that reminds me a lot of the U.K. (it was a British colonial city after all), vibrant King Street with lots of restaurants and rowhomes. It's an urban city and feels like an extension of Washington, D.C., but still has that ""Hot Fuzz"" charm. It's the crown jewel of the metro area imo (though I moved out since it was getting DC-levels of expensive).

Honestly, Mount Vernon Triangle, U Street, and Noma are all recently-converted-transitional neighborhoods, so the ""urban frontier"" won't be too far away at any given point. So they may feel sketchy if you turn the wrong corner. Logan Circle is the gay district of D.C. It's a small cute district, but very expensive. Not sure if you swing that way, but if so, it's a great place to be (Dupont Circle is the former LGBT district, but now is for older gays + diplomats - since it abuts Embassy Row).

Another option for you could be to look to rent from someone who owns a condo, often you get a better price that way.   I am over in Friendship Heights now which is way far for  you, but I am boring and old now :).   But I have lived all over this city.   I went to law school over my NoMa.

I avoid Uber like the plague unless a dire situation (and because two drivers pulled up, my teen daughter put her hand on the door handle - I was behind her - and the driver sped off and cancelled the ride. Couldn't even complain.)

I figured out - and might be dissimilar to your situation - that Lyft has this ""priority service"" that is an outright scam. 

* For example, ""Pick up in 5 minutes, $17. Pick up in 10, $14. Pick up in 20, $10."" Except that if I pick 5 minutes, it can still take 15 and they charge me $20. If I pick 10 minutes, it can come in 5 minutes for $15...or in 20 minutes and they charge $15. Or I pick $20 and it comes in 5 minutes and I'm charged $17. There is absolutely no rhyme or reason. To me, this seems like it is against contract law. Can a store say, ""1 pound of tomatos for $5"" then you get to the cash register and it's $10?? No, that's illegal. Advertised price is advertised price. 
* The ride cancelling is RIFE. Sometimes I have had my ride cancelled 2-3 times before a driver actually comes. And I still pay more than advertised!  A couple years ago I missed two planes because of this. I left 2.5 hours before my flight at DCA and twice didn't make it because of the cancelled rides! Zero possibility to complain as there is no ride or driver to link the complaint to.

Another reason I am straight up Empower, Curb or regular taxi now. Empower might take a bit longer, but the drivers keep all fares except like $100 subscription fee a month.

The other thing is that a couple times I treated myself to a ""Luxury"" Lyft driver and they were all the worst, rudest drivers I ever had on Lyft. Who cares what they car was. One was so comical, I felt like I had been kidnapped my Russian mafia. And not like in a funny way.",25,2023,5,2,1,

>The Connecticut Avenue Multimodal Safety Improvement Project (originally named Connecticut Avenue NW Reversible Lane Safety and Operations Study) was initiated in December 2019. Data analysis, concept development and evaluation, traffic forecasts, and operations analysis were conducted between Spring 2020 and Fall 2020. Between March 2020 and January 2023 approximately 70 stakeholder and agency presentations/events have taken place.

>**During 2021, four Advisory Neighborhood Commissions- ANC 3C, 3E, 3F and 3/4G -and numerous organizations provided resolutions to DDOT requesting that ‚ÄúConcept C‚Äù be advanced. On December 15, 2021, Mayor Bowser and DDOT requested the project staff to move forward with Concept C. Concept C includes the removal of the reversible lanes and the addition of one-way protected bicycle lanes on the east and west sides of Connecticut Avenue.** The project also adds other safety improvements, including the addition of left and right turn lanes at intersections, pedestrian refuge islands and curb extensions, intersection realignments, prohibition of Right Turn on Reds, reducing the posted speed limit from 30 mph to 25 mph, and other features.

>On March 19, 2020, the official start of the Covid-19 pandemic, the District Department of Transportation deactivated the operation of the Connecticut Avenue NW peak hour reversible lanes. A decision was subsequently made to permanently remove the peak hour reversible lanes. Removal of the reversible lanes‚Äô signs and markings were completed in the summer 2022. In addition, one of the Concept C recommendations was to reduce the Connecticut Avenue speed limit from 30 mph to 25 mph. This action was also completed in summer 2022.

>**In early 2023, the DDOT leadership has requested that project staff take a fresh look at all of the concepts that were considered, including a reassessment of Concept C. DDOT has received a considerable number of comments during this past year related to the parking removals required to implement Concept C. This reassessment currently is occurring as of August 2023.**

>DDOT has recently reformulated our Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) for the project. This reformulation of the CAC has occurred because the boundaries of the Advisory Neighborhood Commissions and Single-member Districts have changed based on redistricting and the results of the latest decennial census. We expect that the first meeting of this reformulated CAC will occur in fall 2023.

lzlzwyq,1h2s4bl,rachelella04,"Hey, I lived in rosslyn three years. To preface, I love DC and would live there over Rosslyn if the price and logistics were right for me. Noma might be a better fit for you, but I‚Äôll share my experience in rosslyn at least: 

I loved taking the metro 10 mins or less to Soundcheck for EDM shows, to Metro Center and a short walk to Capitol One arena for bigger concerts or sporting events, or to Warner Theatre and DC improv for comedy shows. Also very convenient for events at the Kennedy Center. Look up the other music venues in DC like The Anthem (at the wharf), 930 club, Atlantis, songbyrd, echostage, flash, capitol one arena, Lincoln theatre, union stage, merriweather post pavilion, etc. Will help you see what the commute would be like to each (the Moovit app is good for public transit estimations).  Songbyrd would be right in your neighborhood in Noma, and Noma has an outdoor free concert series in the summer. Need to take a couple legs to get to several of the venues from rosslyn (eg need to transfer on metro from O/B/S to green line north to get to U st venues of 930 and Atlantis, or to green line south to get to wharf venues of Anthem and Union stage). But honestly when shows get out after 1 AM you‚Äôre likely going to have to uber/lyft home to noma or to rosslyn either way for most of these venues since our metro system doesn‚Äôt run too late here. I find Ubers/lyfts home to rosslyn decently affordable since by mileage it‚Äôs not far from DC proper. If there‚Äôs surge pricing, I just e-bike home instead ‚Äî it‚Äôs honestly my fave mode of getting around DC since we have such robust bike lanes.

There‚Äôs a small social scene in Rosslyn if you‚Äôre looking to grab a beer right after work - there‚Äôs a neighborhood bar called Quinn‚Äôs that‚Äôs always busy.  Open road is also always busy during HH as is continental beer garden in warm months. Salt cocktail bar for something fancier. But as a whole like others have said, don‚Äôt expect any nightlife here or extensive restaurant and bar options. You can walk to  Clarendon for more restaurant and bar options, but lots of basic early 20 years old there, I always personally prefer the venture into DC proper for the actual DC cultural experience. So yes, you‚Äôll have more options in noma. 

Re social clubs and sports, will prob have better access in Noma. I have friends on intramural teams that are based in noma, and my bf‚Äôs soccer teams are often in the district in navy yard or Shaw. 

Also re social life, I commented on someone else‚Äôs post that almost all my friends are in DC because I made an effort to spend time in DC, not Arlington. I have a single friend in Arlington and countless friends in DC. Its certainly helpful when my DC friends live or enjoy hanging out in neighborhoods most convenient for me to get to from rosslyn, such as DuPont circle, Georgetown, west end, foggy bottom, Chinatown, Logan circle. When I‚Äôve had friends up in Columbia heights, petworth, Adams Morgan, or Mount Pleasant it‚Äôs more of a PITA by public transit to get to them. Some friends are more willing than others to pick a meeting spot that‚Äôs a good middle ground for both parties. And as the other poster said, some people are a bit immature about crossing over the river despite rosslyn being one metro stop (three mins) from the district. Now if they don‚Äôt want to take multiple legs of transit to get to someone that‚Äôs one thing, but if they live in Capitol Hill and would be open to taking O/B/S lines to foggy bottom, but not rosslyn, that‚Äôs just asinine imo. I had a rooftop pool I invited my friends to in the summer, and one of them literally gave me that as her rationale for passing - just tell me you don‚Äôt wanna come‚Ä¶ But yeah, if you‚Äôre trying to date, I could potentially see it being an automatic swipe left when ppl see you‚Äôre in Arlington because of those mindsets, so to keep your options open, noma could be better in that sense (although I personally wouldn‚Äôt want to date someone so closed-minded lol)

Not sure how much crime matters to you, but noma‚Äôs is worse than rosslyn‚Äôs for sure. Nothing particularly wrong with that if you have a good head on your shoulders and have tolerance for some grunginess and sketchiness - chance of being assaulted is higher but many prefer neighborhoods with character and more crime over a bland area like rosslyn. The vibes in the two neighborhoods couldn‚Äôt be more different - night and day.
 
For me, I fly a lot - so I love that rosslyn gets me metro access to both DCA and IAD easily without transfers.  I value commute to work, airport access, safety, and love walking home from the metro late at night alone. So I accept that rosslyn itself doesn‚Äôt have a vibrant social life for me, and that there is an additional hassle of having to take the metro or bike to have access to DC vibes that I love, rather than being able to walk to them (cannot afford to live in DC / I don‚Äôt like the neighborhoods that I can afford).

As for the bus, I think buses are great! I've never had any major issues and any time someone has gotten out of hand (such as shouting or swearing a lot) the bus driver told the person to knock it off or they would kick them off. 

Or consider getting a bike or Capital Bikeshare membership - I use bikeshare to get from the metro to work (about 1 mile) and it is great!

Three thoughts:

1. Do not get into a set routine - leaving and/or coming home at the same time every day and taking the same exact route every day is a mistake anywhere. I feel very safe where I live (and my fiance is a 6' tall big guy with a beard) but I still make a point to vary my routine one day every week or two - leave 15 minutes earlier, come home slightly later, stop at the grocery store randomly, etc.

2. Consider carrying pepper spray or some other similar option. I used to in college, don't feel the need to anymore. I never needed it but it made me feel safer at the time. It also gave me more confidence and a better ""don't fuck with me"" attitude. Which leads me to ... 

3. If you walk around like you know where you are going and do not want anyone to mess with you most people will leave you alone. If you are staring at your phone (or otherwise distracted), looking around like you are lost, or are just generally unsure then it draws more attention.

I don't disagree with points 1-3 (even thought point 2 is the most applicable to the situation) and point 4 is exactly what I am asking about in this post. I don't want to just act on my own feelings and end up making the situation worse.

I think the spirit of this post is essentially asking how do you act as a good bystander in these situations especially when it's a male shouting at a female. I don't think this is a simple question to answer because we are constantly told to ""see something say something"" but then also ""mind your business"" in cities. This feels like a clear contradiction to me. I obviously would say asking for advice is a reasonable thing to do because not everyone grows up in a city and there is no manual on how one should act in a city before moving here. 

I get that there are concerns about astroturfing on the sub and I don't really know how to fix that. As a result, I get the hostility you showed off the bat. All I can share is what I went through and have questions/concerns about that it seems many other people also think about.",4,2023,5,2,1,

Event planners, venues, and caterers all hate these gigs for a reason. Even the parties that are well-organized, with good contracts and insurance and enough security/bartenders, are drunkfests.

I was actually at the non-NYE venue the year the Building Museum incident happened - we were horrified and it 100% reinforced our decision not to sell that date. (Late Night Shots was also effectively blacklisted from the industry.) 

That same year the Harman Center (Shakespeare Theatre) ended an NYE party early and kicked everyone out of the venue after a guest got shitfaced and smashed a sculpture in the lobby :(

They'll temporarily credit you back the amount and take the money out of the business's account while a fraud investigator investigates. The investigator may or may not reach out to you. The offending party/business has 60 (or 90, I don't remember) days to dispute the chargeback and provide evidence that you should have to pay (e.g., services were rendered). If they don't respond, or you're clearly in the right, the credit will stay on your account (aka refund) and the business doesn't get it back.

Also, a reason for the move away from this was the rampant corruption of those foot patrol officers who either was paid off to elected to turn a blind eye to a lot of the organized crime in their areas.  

Interestingly enough, our operations in Iraq up to 2007-2008 surge was very much like our police, we'd drive around in our humvees looking for or in many cases waiting for insurgents to engage us while conducting soft/hard knock searches at night. During the surge we conducted more foot patrols, integrated into our local areas in small COPs with local Iraqi police or Iraqi army units and created a much bigger and sustained presence versus daily patrols from our FOB. This marked at first large incidents of fighting because we were not embedded in our AOs but dropped shortly as we denied the insurgents freedom of movement and ability to operate within the local population.

kjewb6w,19el7l2,thebarkingdog,"MPD here.

First answer: We don't have the officers. 

We're so short most Districts are holding over officers from the previous shift nearly every day to make minimum staffing. We weren't defunded, but the freeze in hiring by the council in 2020 will be felt for another decade. And we HAVE to staff the patrol cars first, and we can barely do that. 

Ex. 5 years ago, Adams Morgan and U Street had two units, 40 officers, 20 for each location in addition to regular patrol. That unit is now down to 15 officers for both locations.

Second Answer: Resource allocation. 

Contee made the news when he consolidated and made the all bike patrol unit a few years ago. Except it wasn't made up of new officers but instead, officers he pulled from the Districts. So those Districts lost their officers to other parts of the city.

Third: Practicality. 

Putting someone on a foot beat for 40 hours a week, wears on them. Now factor in weather, call volume, duties, training, etc. And you can see where it can go wrong. Also, for all the criticism of cops simply sitting in their cars, cars provide a safe place to sit, place to store food, gear, paperwork, a computer, and when an emergency comes out, nearby or across the District, officers need cars to get there faster than feet can.",32,2024,1,2,1,

As your USA Today piece points out, white police officers tend to live in the cities where they worked when those cities were majority-white and white officers were also more likely to reside outside the city than their Black or Latino counterparts.

The piece also includes the argument that residency requirements should be more specific in order to be effective and require officers to live in the neighborhoods where they work. 

I don‚Äôt know if any program has included that much specificity or been enforced with any kind of effort beyond a cursory check of a provided address.

Someone was just robbed at gunpoint on the front stoop of my apartment building LAST NIGHT. A terrifying experience, no doubt. However, I give you my cost benefit analysis of why it's still worth it to live in the hood.

Let's say you get mugged, and give them what they want, immediately (which, for the record, you should ALWAYS DO, without question). You'll end up losing your cash, nothing on credit if you call your company soon enough, and probably the fees to get a new license/ID, maybe your Smartrip, etc. Maybe you also lose your nice purse or wallet, but we'll say all of that is worth around $250. The biggest ""cost"" you'll face is the fear of being mugged. Say that is $1000 worth of fear to you (weird concept, but humor me here - this is how cost benefit analysis works). If you move to Near NE, KNOWING that you will get mugged, it becomes something that you're prepared for, and slightly less scared of. The cost of doing business, so to speak. You know it's going to happen, you're not going to get hurt if you hurry up and give the money and don't argue, and you have come to terms with that. And then it becomes a little less scary, and maybe you're only facing $500 of fear. That is now only $750 you're going to lose by being mugged. If it happens once a year (WAY more often than real life), that is a lot less than you're saving on rent by living in the hood. Of course, realizing all this and internalizing it makes the idea even less scary (although guns are still REALLY scary in person) so it's an even better deal.

I've lived around H st for 2 years and never had a problem. I've seen problems, and heard of them, and had them happen to my friends, but it hasn't happened to me yet. I'm prepared for it though, by assuming it WILL eventually happen. If the area gentrifies even more (which it appears to be doing), bonus! In fact, chances are you may never be mugged. But if you do get mugged, you ""knew"" it going in, so it will be manageable.",1,2010,11,2,1,

c15xusg,e7axk,awshux,"Agree on the very loose definition of Capitol Hill - I live SE of there, and I would say that while you're fine in general, it might be a good idea to do common sense things, like not brandishing a smart phone (if you have one), having a not-obvious laptop bag (ditto), cuffs over your watch (if it's nice), etc.  Be eyes up, and making friends with neighbors also helps tremendously.",1,2010,11,2,1,

WASHINGTON (NNS) -- An active shooter was reported inside the Naval Sea Systems Command Headquarters building (Bldg. 197) on the Washington Navy Yard at 8:20 a.m. (Eastern Time).

There is one confirmed injury. Emergency personnel are on scene and a ""shelter in place"" order has been issued for Navy Yard personnel.

The Naval Sea Systems Command's headquartes is the work place for about 3,000 people.

The organization is comprised of command staff, headquarters directorates, affiliated Program Executive Offices (PEOs) and numerous field activities. Together, we engineer, build, buy and maintain ships, submarines and combat systems that meet the Fleet's current and future operational requirements.

Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) is the largest of the Navy's five system commands. With a fiscal year budget of nearly $30 billion, NAVSEA accounts for one quarter of the Navy's entire budget. With a force of 60,000 civilian, military and contract support personnel, NAVSEA engineers, builds, buys and maintains the Navy's ships and submarines and their combat systems.",11,2013,9,2,1,

cc9g072,1mhwjr,maker86,"I'm going to assume he has a few issues here.  First, the guy probably isn't using an assault rifle as most people define it.  The distinction has to do with whether the rifle can fire more than one bullet with a pull of the trigger.  It's unlikely that an automatic weapon would be used in a crime as they're fairly expensive and hard to come by.  If this is just a standard AR-15 type weapon, and that's what it sounds like, it would be more appropriately defined as an assault weapon (as opposed to assault rifle), though that term is often also met with hostility as it classes a weapon based more on appearance than functionality.

The other possible issue is that if this were instead an automatic rifle, say an M4 or M16, that fact wouldn't really matter much.  Automatic fire is seldom useful for anything but suppression, which means keeping the enemy under cover while friendlies reposition or evacuate.  It's true that automatic gun fire can kill many people quickly if they're all grouped together and not expecting it, but this situation has evolved past that now.

More useful information would be a whether its a standard rifle or a carbine, the caliber of the rifle, what kind of optics he has, does it look like he's carrying a lot of extra magazines, does he have any sidearms or specialty weapons like a shotgun for breeching, any kind of grenades, what other gear is he wearing, and does he have any kind of communication equipment.  I'm not saying that knowing if the rifle is capable of full auto is not useful information, but it is not as useful as the other information I've noted.  Additionally, the media has proven themselves unreliable in determining weapon types, so there's absolutely no reason to take them seriously in this regard.",5,2013,9,2,1,
cc9fyiq,1mhwjr,,"The ""assault"" designator can be useful assuming we know enough about the rifle. It has a specific definition relating to the caliber and action type. If we don't know the caliber or whether it is fully-automatic, ""automatic rifle"" is the preferred nomenclature (automatic can be semi or fully). 

In the case of, say, an M-16 vs. AR-15, the M-16 is an assault rifle whereas the AR-15 is a ""modern sporting rifle"" or simply ""[semi-]automatic rifle"".",2,2013,9,2,1,

They bought it in the mid-80s with less than 3% down and the thing has gone up in value over 12x since they bought it and they‚Äôve done relatively minimal improvements since the mid 90s. 

Until the last 5 years, many of their neighbors were 9-5 public sector employees or worked at NGOs or other non-profits. Most but not all were college educated with bachelors degrees but were not lobbyists or ‚ÄúBig Law‚Äù lawyers or anything. The woman who lived next door worked at the DC public library and her husband was an HVAC technician before he retired. 

Recently, many longtime residents have retired and sold their houses to the folks many other commenters will assume already owned these houses. Some have been forced to sell because they couldn‚Äôt afford the real estate taxes on their dramatically appreciated houses.

While the new buyers today quite wealthy in many west-of-park neighborhoods, this was not always the case. The city was very different back when my parents bought their place in a whole host of ways. The dramatic appreciation in real estate values since the mid-90s, and the post-08 change in the mortgage process, has completely changed the profile of people who can buy here. 

Those younger buyers replacing my childhood neighbors are of course in the stereotypical industries. Those are the only people who can afford to buy those houses at market these days. Many of these folks are transient DC residents and not native Washingtonians who bought way before the housing market became what it is today. There‚Äôs no issue with new people moving here, it‚Äôs just that those folks are the only ones who can buy at market. 

Tl;dr: lots of the transient folks in those areas are wealthy, many of the long time residents bought in a different era when it was much easier to buy a place to live here. The number LTRs declines every year because by definition they are all old and aging.",70,2021,10,2,1,

But still, tell me in what world someone is able to pay for housing and save the  equivalent value of the equity they gain on their home each month.

Yes there are upfront and backend costs to sale. Yes there is tax and insurance and interest costs. But all these exist in commercial real estate as well and are passed on to the renter. 

Also to describe a mortgage as not owning the house until the end of the mortgage is totally inaccurate. If that were the case you wouldn't see a dime selling the house before the mortgage was up. You own the value of the house minus the amount owed to the mortgage lender. 

The premise of your point is still faulty. There is no where I've lived where renting an equivalent property cost less than a mortgage including property tax, interest and insurance.

The problem is not that you still pay for housing when you purchase your home because those costs are explicitly laid out when you buy the house. The problem is indeed that if you invest your down-payment and don't buy a house, you still have to pay the equivalent of a mortgage and all related costs to house yourself. There isn't magic extra money to invest.

Must be in shape, clean the apartment, cook me three meals, and share my bed‚Äù style bullshit. 

If we are going to look past that, here are a few thoughts:

Have you ever shared a studio before? I know you said you‚Äôre fine with it, but until you‚Äôve done it you might not be thinking about some of the practical challenges it entails. I shared a studio with my now husband when I first moved here and we were waiting for his lease to run out. Sharing a space with no walls can be awkward even if you are in a relationship with the person. I can‚Äôt imagine sharing one with someone I didn‚Äôt know.

Think about things like sleep habits, different levels of cleanliness, etc. When you have a roommate but each have your own bedroom it creates the idea of private vs. shared space. The general consensus among every roommate I‚Äôve ever had is that your bedroom can be as messy as you want but the common space is to be kept clean as a courtesy to your roommates. A studio, even a large one, could create an environment where one of you wants to be awake when the other wants to be asleep, or where one person keeps things very tidy and the other person lets their ‚Äúbedroom‚Äù area king of take over.

This isn‚Äôt to say dude is a bad guy‚Äîalthough of course you are correct to be wary of assault, sexual violence, theft, etc when moving in with anyone‚Äîbut someone‚Äôs annoying habits become a lot more annoying when you can‚Äôt get away from them. Additionally, it will likely always feel like his space and not your home. What happens if one of you meets and brings them home or someone wants to entertain? 

If you do go for it, I‚Äôd definitely take the small dressing room area and put a single bed in there, lock the door and be done with it. That said, it could produce its own challenges, if you‚Äôre in the dressing room that means he now needs to get dressed and ready entirely in the bathroom, or else he‚Äôs just naked in the common space, which is awkward.

This is a vibrant city full of amazing, ambitious, smart, and interesting folks, some of whom you will form deep friendships and bonds with at this time in your life -- if you put yourself in the right situations. Sharing a studio with anyone, let alone a much older stranger, would have a strongly negative impact on your social life in myriad ways, which is not at all worth any potential financial savings IMO.

If this were a 2nd bedroom and it were reasonably priced, there would be fewer red flags for me. But you need to ask yourself what does he gain from this? Why would a grown ass man, who likely makes six figures, want to rent out part of his studio apartment for someone much younger? Let's just be real here. When I was younger, I definitely saw housing posts from older men who were offering a place for obscenely low rent. And that's because you'd be paying the rest of the rent in sexual favors.
