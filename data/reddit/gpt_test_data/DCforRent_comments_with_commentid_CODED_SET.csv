2,i9csov5,utr8aw,Ok_Priority_1534,"Downtown/Central DC.

As I'm looking at different neighborhood's there are correlations made between prices and reported crime rates. 
There are definitely patterns, it's just not entirely clear what they mean beyond statistics. 
I currently live in a city that supposedly high crime. There have been three homicides within a half mile of my home in the last 6 months but I'm in a quiet little pocket that gets no traffic and has little to no crime.",1,2022,5,1

4,io5bcjq,xciciq,cheesyuser,"Thats a difficult ask. The 2000 range may be doable in some outskirts and once you get out into Fairfax County. If you want popular locations in DC for the higher end of your range look into *possibly* private english basements, decreasing your rent by grabbing a roommate(s) or giving up your car to increase your rent costs. 

To put it into perspective I think a traditional 500 sq foot 1 br/1 ba in central areas of DC/Arlington/Alexandria (also keep in mind yellow/blue lines are cut off from Alexandria for the forseeable future) go for about 2400/2500 and maybe a jr 1 br for 2200.

Edit: a studio may also be your friend in the areas you seek for the top end of your budget.",2,2022,9,0

Personally I love that area. I can't speak to the actual crime levels, but when I lived in that area, it felt safe. Follow all the standard recommendations for maintaining awareness in a city and you should be fine. If I could afford it, I'd live on Lanier Place in a heartbeat.",6,2023,5,1

I have a place available in Pentagon City. Very safe walkable neighborhood in Arlington with everything you can need within about 3 blocks. Blue line goes straight to GW. Monthly budget would come to a little under $1400 however.

21,c9h5qox,1chwv9,meelar,"That particular stretch is kind of dicey (I live at 4th and O SW, and the three blocks makes a big difference).  I would recommend coming down there at night and checking it out before signing a contract--it's a higher-crime area than the stuff immediately around it.  That said, the area is changing rapidly--they just opened a new building at O and South Capitol, so that may impact the feel of the area.",2,2013,4,1

I love the neighborhood and feel pretty safe walking around, but I wouldn't stumble home drunk from the bar or anything like that. There is a lot of low-income housing in the blocks around 1st and O (that can freak out some people), but people in the neighborhood are generally friendly. I've been proactive about saying hello when walking/running/biking nearby and have never had any trouble.",1,2013,4,1

Anyways, if you're male, above 6', and don't dress preppy you should be OK.

81,iczh6sc,vg2hi9,PeterBeHangin,"I moved to DC back in March and wasn’t very familiar with any of the neighborhoods. I chose H St NE (AKA the Atlas District, AKA Near Northeast) and so far love it. There’s everything I need right on H. Capitol Hill is a fantastic area, especially for taking my pup on longer walks. There’s a couple nearby dog parks. And most importantly it’s a more affordable area in DC with no serious crime issues. (There’s crime, but it’s mostly theft and carjackings)",4,2022,6,1
