There definitely is a culture here of minding your own business, but people also DO help each other out (if they think they can without making the situation worse). Clearly not every time though. Agree it is exhausting to be on high alert, but as for advice from another petite woman who lived in admo- trust your gut. Go to a different bus stop if needed. Eye contact with no one. Duck into a shop (many people know they will get hit w a trespass if they go into the businesses), wave at another woman down the street to make it look like you’re meeting someone.

Also, I hate to say this, but  the chance that someone will help you while being harassed seems to be pretty slim. I had a man who kept screaming at me and pushing me/laying on me on the metro and I was actively yelling at him to get away from me, and there were 4 other grown men literally right in front of me and they all just stared while it happened.

When walking through cities you gotta spot the weirdos like 50+ feet away and make a beeline around them. Pick them out of the crowd at a distance and you won’t have to deal with them up close.

Cross the street if you have to to avoid them and don’t feel ashamed. I see people all the time casually walk within arms length of severely mentally ill people while they’re having an episode- screaming, pants down, flailing — You’re never to blame in those scenarios if accosted, but *don’t* put that risk upon yourself, that’s 101. 

Don’t speak to those people, don’t make eye contact, don’t go anywhere near someone while they’re having a psychotic episode. This has always been the golden rule from multiple psychiatrists in my family and it’s proven true, having growing up in 1990s NYC.

I’m sorry this has happened to you. There’s little doubt the streets have gotten far messier in DC since the pandemic. If anyone *ever* touches you or threatens you on the street in public, make a scene, call 911 and don’t feel embarrassed.

By the way, 911 here is very unreliable. But if you “go loud” in a public place, you will in most scenarios attract attention - the good kind.

1865,lp3l0xj,1fpo3o7,under_psychoanalyzer,"Take people who are obviously have paranoid delusionals off the streets. I don't actually know why its worse in DC than a lot of other US cities. I'm not a expert on vulnerable communities. Like yes we let juveniles go a lot. Part of it could be that we actually do what is *supposed* to be good in terms of public housing, and we dont put it all in one area. Even though EOTR is certainly higher in certain crime, Adams morgan, foggy bottom, etc. all have public housing where as other cities administration would just building public housing EOTR happily segregating it.


The US in general has a very large problem where we simply don't have mental aslyums anymore. We ran them very poorly until we stopped having them altogether around the time of Nixon IIRC. Bush also cut of a bunch of funding IIRC because at some point in the 2000s if you tried to commit suicide it went from actual inpatient psychiatric care in hospitals to being handcuffed to a bed for 72 hours then kicked to the curb. That's the same place funding for these people on the streets would come from. Then on top of that the ACLU argued a case that set a precedent that makes it *incredibly* difficult to commit someone without their own or their families consent. So across all of America, if someone needs to be taken off the street because they're having a mental psych episode, if they dont want to go, the only option is jail. 


In DC this is probably, as a guess, not an expert, compounded because we don't have a place to put even people doing criminal acts. One of the perks of no statehood is we don't even have much of a jail. Like think about if we actually arrested every person walking around the city right now obviously out of their mind and who has threatened somebody recently? We don't have the resources to process, hold, and transport all those people. 


With all fentanyl and all the other crazy shit going on this country needs to get over its aversion to long term psychiatric holds. But Republicans don't want to pay for ""freeloaders"" and Democrats dont want to ""marginalize"" already downtrodden people, even if long term care is literally someone's only hope. 


If it had an easy solution we'd do it. But the answer like a lot of DC problems is: we're not a state and we're afraid to jail people, even though the latter happened as a result of good intentions we swung the pendulum too far imho. But what the fuck do I know.",10,2024,9,2,1

Lol, if you were interested in having a good faith discussion, you would bring the statistics you allude to rather than assume my level of awareness and invite me to ""look up the stats."" And very specifically, please provide evidence of correlation of the other crime to the harassment of women, since you make that claim. I would love to see how car theft is correlated to harassment. 

You moved the goalpost and are now speaking of evidence based discussion but originally used an unfalsifiable claim of your own experience living in several areas. But you seem happy to discount the anecdotes of others and require stats when you receive pushback. ""Normal"" isn't an evidence based term, by the way. It's very subjective and relies on individual perspective. Which is basically my whole point. Someone like my wife who grew up in small town America and has been harassed and assaulted numerous times in her small town life, but has experienced zero of the same since moving to NYC or DC is a great example of of what I'm saying.

I agree that Atlanta has lost its southern hospitality years ago after so many transplants moved here. People are still nice though… until they get in their cars and they are downright nasty. I laugh at dmv drivers when I’m there bc Atlanta drivers are so much worse in many ways. When I moved to Atlanta, a southern woman gave me her bed after she found out that I had nowhere to stay that night. Can’t get more kind and trusting than that, but that was 30 years ago. People are not that way anymore in many areas all over the US. I still do think people are more warm in Atlanta though in general. 

In DC metro, there are so many people who are mostly there for government work, like lobbyists, politicians, politician’s interns, diplomats, attorneys, etc and they don’t feel a sense of wanting to belong the way true residents do. My mom had a lobbyist neighbor and he was one of the nastiest people I’ve ever met. Her other neighbor worked for the World Bank and while they were nice, they kept to themselves and their Bangladeshi friends. Also in the 20ish years I lived in dc metro, I don’t recall anyone randomly being friendly as I walked down the street. When I moved to Atlanta and people started saying hi and waving, I was immediately suspicious and grumpy, at first thinking they weren’t greeting me and then “what do they want from me?”  because even though I knew people in my MD neighborhood, no one ever said hi. We definitely didn’t know anyone in my grandparents neighborhood even though they lived there for 30-40 years. And no one ever said hi in the district when walking down the street that I recall. People were usually busy rushing doing whatever they doing. 

I am happy that you are enjoying the DMV though, considering I love it there and miss it a lot. I’ve thought about moving back so many times, but the cost of buying a house and other living expenses there is so much more expensive than it is in Atlanta. DC has so much more going for it, although Atlanta metro is more livable from my pov. I know Atlanta is catching up in terms of cost of living but I still think it’s cheaper here overall, even living in the city. I also miss the intelligence and culture of the people in DC metro.

1930,htjh7lc,s8cihs,classicalL,"So you are mostly spot on in my opinion. I'm a native but I have lived elsewhere. Frankly LA driving style is far worse than the constant complaints about MD drivers by the region...

WMATA is great, second honestly only to living in NYC (which I have done). LA, Boston, Chicago, SF. I've uses these systems (not MARTA though), and DC's transport system is better than pretty much all of those. Maybe SF is close, NYC is better. Right now though it is very empty so. Hopefully that will change. But right now the headways are bad. In the 90s and 00s WMATA was AMAZING. It turned out that was deferring tons of maintenance. But they ran trains to super late with low headways and nothing was broken. We are paying for those days now. Nevertheless it is still a really good system. Go to Europe and have the transit workers all go on strike. The union has problems and the org needs to fix some structural problems but it will get better. If gas prices go up enough ridership will return if people either get used to COVID or it dies back.

DC is largely gentrified out. That's a very different feel than it was in the 90s. Some old timers don't like that, but the city is on the whole a lot safer and cleaner than it was in NE in particular but also near the waterfront.

DC has so many cultural things and many of them free, it spoils you. Again if COVID would just get a lid on things even more stuff about the city would come back and be enjoyed. The region is ridiculously educated. Amazon didn't site HQ2 here just for money reasons... I honestly thing DC was hitting a critical size where it would grow from regional demand rather than just Fed money. 

DC feels more like a city than LA does honestly but less like a city sometimes than even Baltimore because it doesn't have that high rise center that so many cities have with the taller buildings near Union Station or in VA. Hopefully any zoning will be removed and we can have the stuff behind Union Station get really tall and it will feel like that is the city center. I don't know. Berlin has a pretty low rise spread out feel also but it is way dirtier and gritter like parts of NYC and not the good ones.

I guess I have gone on my own tangent but DC's region is one of the best in the country and the best for certain specific things. People are far to enamored with the west coast cities which honestly aren't that interesting for the most part.",2,2022,1,2,1

If/when DC goes back to normal, traffic will become horrific and so will the metro 😭. Metro is much more expensive than Marta but is way more useful - I used to live in Brookhaven and the only reason why I used Marta was to get to the airport. 

Some advice - when using the metro escalators, left side of the step = walking side & right side = standing side! Don’t ever stand on the left side of escalator steps, even when it isn’t packed. Everyone’s in a rush & you will probably get run over.

I lived in Atlanta for 12 years and never, ever had people do the downright weird things they'll do here, going out of their way to avoid interacting with me or even having to acknowledge my presence. In both apartments I've lived in and both buildings I've worked in here, I've had people literally stare at the floor, the wall or the ceiling as they walk by me in a hallway, to avoid looking at me or having to say any sort of hello. This has happened at least a dozen times, with different people in different placesso I know I'm not imagining it. 

People will either rush to get into their apartment and shut the door if they see you coming, or if they're halfway out the door, will go back inside and shut the door until you pass. This behavior was all happening pre-Covid so I can't blame it on that.

I've said ""Hello"" to people when we passed by a foot from each other on the sidewalk in a residential area and had them just look at me like I was a tree or a car and not say a word. I'd say there's a 50/50 chance of that happening vs getting a response.",27,2022,1,2,1

I thought of Atlanta because it's close to family, but I don't like the lower salaries, crime, or traffic. I've had the same weird experiences as you in apartment complexes too. One day I was just chillin at the mailbox on a bluetooth call. There was this one lady who I sorta liked, but never got to talk to that was my neighbor. She just sat there waiting for me to get out, like she wanted me to go first so she didn't have to say anything to me. It was weird.

I've noticed dating is hard too there in that in Atlanta it seemed like people only talk to groups of people that they grew up with. The cost of living worries me with DC though. Some of the suburbs of Atlanta like Alpharetta, Sandy Springs, and Roswell have homes that are 600k+, which don't make sense considering most jobs only pay 40 to 60k.

Agreed about the Beltline! It will be wonderful when that's completed. Unincorporated DeKalb County is awful for sidewalks IMHO, though, while unincorporated Montgomery County has trails connecting cul-de-sacs in remote parts of the county per Google Maps. Holy shit.

Tbh DC IMHO beats the Buford Highway because so many different avenues are like it. Check out Honduran eats on Huntington Avenue, Vietnamese on Wilson/Clarendon, Ethiopian on Georgia Avenue, Salvadoran on Columbia Pike and Baltimore Avenue, if you haven't already. Peruvian of course, everywhere, plus Iranian. Buford Highway was good but there is so much inexpensive international food everywhere here. I get ehhh pupusas for $3 in my home burb in Cincinnati and amazing carefully prepared ones here for $2 in College Park or Arlington. Idk, just stating this if you haven't explored the hole in the wall food scene. Oh I forgot about Colombian food in Silver Spring (Arepas Pues).

Lol, I think we have opposite feelings about weather. It beats Philly (less cold/windy/super rainy) and Atlanta (skull slapping humidity, thunderstorms, and frequent power outages). Frankly even Cincy and Cincinnati weather is pretty reasonable. The summer was nowhere near as miserable as Atlanta and the winter is not like Philly or even Cincinnati, where it can reach 0°F with no humidity. Nose bleed time lol. Philly I think is the worst because it's hot and humid or cold, rainy, humid, and windy. Here gets hot and cold but I don't have rain flying into my bones through three layers like Philly.

* Alexandria housed the largest human trafficking (slave-trading) company in the US. A major factor in retrocession of DC land to VA was to try to protect this slave trade from a potential abolitionist majority in Congress, which could end slavery in DC.

2426,jwady54,15qu0ac,,"My answer to 4 is that D.C. is actually pretty terrible at producing public space to *dwell*, for hours. Users often (correctly) praise the city’s walkability, but we don’t tend to converse about that other crucial part of any urban environment: the ability to dwell. Every time people bring up the urbanist wet-dream cities like Barcelona, they tend to talk about walkability, commerce, sustainability, etc. All of these are important, but one crucial aspect missed is that Barcelona, Madrid, Amsterdam, etc, have different *spatial imperatives*. Put simply, there’s a difference in what a body is obliged to do. 

In Washington, D.C., a body is obliged to walk, but only walk. Parks are pretty far apart, and many don’t offer much beyond the ability to sit on a hard bench that may or may not have a curved back to prevent napping (yay, anti-homeless architecture). The action, for example, of stopping and chilling on a certain sidewalk will earn you some dirty looks and maybe some dirty words. Most of this city is a sidewalk. This never became more apparent than when I had to walk with my elderly father to the Optometrist’s. He could obviously have benefited from a place to chill at certain points, but even those terrible benches are not so populated within the city. I’ve seen many people sit on those sidewalk-level window sills of stores, just to catch a break from the incessant movement our design commands. Watch one 4K walking tour of these European cities that we want to emulate: they just congregate wherever the fuck they want. It’s seen as normal to just stand, to lean on things, to exist as you feel comfortable. They don’t need a designated space. Hell, we need that designated space more than the Europeans, and we don’t even have as many! We don’t have those wonderful, directionless squares/piazzas they do. 

There will probably be some able-bodied, young to middle-aged Redditors that contest what I’m saying, but as the great sociologist Richard Sennett says, most cities aren’t built for seniors. Really, you could expand that and say most American cities aren’t built for anyone outside of a particularly envisioned urban subject, one who is either physically indefatigable, or a driver.",1,2023,8,2,1

My father, a machinist-turned-electrical-engineer, spent his career at metro developing these signs.  I remember dinner table conversations about realtime computing and how to reconcile the train schedule with actuaI location readings.  And how to do it all within the constraints of legacy hardware with limited memory and bitrates.  I remember his consideration on displaying train length on the board.  Or whether reclaiming some space with an abbreviation would create confusion.  I remember when he took me to see the sign prototypes in the lab several levels below ground in the Jackson building.  And when he started to get sick, pushing him to work in his wheelchair to that same basement.  He described working for metro as passion, not a job.  I'm reminded of that passion every time I wait for the train and see one of these signs.  Eight months into the quarantine and i suppse that's been a while.  So seeing yours hit me like an emotional ton of bricks.

I miss him so much.  I love your project and I'd have loved to show it to him.  I know he'd have appreciated your work and i know hed have loved the signs too.

For now, if you’re interested in getting started with Home Assistant, here’s how I did the WMATA integration:

1.	I used Node-RED to handle the WMATA API requests. There was a lot response parsing with the WMATA API, so Node-RED made it easier to manipulate the payloads.
2.	Node-RED, after parsing the API responses, creates a sensor in Home Assistant - one for each station/track combo based on the stations monitored in the Node-RED flow.
3.	The sensor contains attributes for the response values, as well as a formatted HTML attribute for use in the Home Assistant front-end.
4.	I’m using Home Assistant custom secondary-info card to display the formatted HTML below the sensor value.

Happy to help you or anyone else who would be interested in setting this up in Home Assistant. Definitely was a fun project to do!

The same goes for the anti suburban stance— it is a poor use of space to spread people out that way when they could be concentrated closer to the places they work. Again, environmental. 

On the other hand the “crime is a reality of city living” view is not environmentally motivated at all— that perspective is socioeconomically motivated (and often race plays a role as well). 

The belief there is generally that crime is an artifact of poverty, lack of opportunity, community conflict, and the trauma of institutional racism which are disproportionately experienced by poor and minority populations. In this sense it is seen as a social injustice to “eradicate crime” from the city because in order to do so one would either have to:

- eliminate poverty
- remove the poor  

And generally the latter ends up being easier to accomplish than the former (and more widely supported by the folks that feel that poor people deserve to be punished; or those that simply don’t want to acknowledge their existence).

It’s not all about environmentalism, though.

It’s important to note that advocates for urban living and alternative modes of transport (besides just cars) see great value in the fiscal efficency that is gained from increased density. The idea is to build a society where there is enough cash in the coffers to offer robust social programs to abate tendencies towards socioeconomically motivated crime *and* the city budget actually balances out. 

This is because it’s insanely expensive to offer city amenities to near-rural population densities, and these expenses sap a great deal of money from tax revenue which is mostly generated in urban areas. Combine that with the fact that it’s expensive and time consuming for an individual to get anywhere with the costly car that’s required to exist and it’s a lose-lose situation. Society and the individual are fiscally worse off. 

I would go so far as to say that the environmental impact is actually considered a nice but incidental knock-on effect to the “car < bike” people.

If humans simply went into stasis or something for the other 16 hours of the day, maybe that would be valid... but that line of thinking seems to result in the idea that the _best_ way to live would be for everyone to move into holes dug around the equator.

And even better, more feasible option would be to petition for permanent WFH.  Let companies get tax breaks for allowing WFH.  (mostly hypothetical argument).

The problem I have with just “throw them in jail” is that doesn’t rehabilitate them! As it relates to argument (a) they do have PLENTY of opportunity but you do know how intellectually disability/lack of education  creates low self confidence. Self-efficacy is needed to get and keep a job. To learn, to Adapt, and have other skills necessary for all job stability. It’s non empathic to just say, people don’t want to work; they might have mental barriers to getting and/or keeping a job; (2) likely those who are worse off, have strong family support. Think about it, tons of folks live with their supportive parents until they find a job, save for a house, and move out. Heck, now, even folks who get degrees often have to move back home. Not everyone has that family support. Let’s be real. 

Ah, yes, you could give these some folks free money. They’d blow it because their morals/values align with materialism. Often, those folks don’t realize they have low self-confidence and buy expensive things as a proxy for self-worth. Social media has heightened folks lack of self confidence with ignorant folks liking someone wearing designers clothes; when in reality, people should be saying, “why do you value designer clothes more than education, charity for others, and/or your relationships?

> Ward 7 faces a similar problem with the lack of sit-down eateries and proliferation of plexiglass, which can make customers feel like they’re being suspected as criminals. Thai Orchid’s Kitchen was originally supposed to open in Ward 7 as a carryout joint, plexiglass and all (co-owner Ramaesh Bhagirat of Guyana has lived in Ward 7 for 20 years). But neighbors reached out to the owners, and D.C officials enforced zoning rules. The restaurant opened sans glass, with chairs.

> But what happens when such pioneers get robbed? In the case of Thai Orchid’s Kitchen, neighbors rallied around the owners after an armed robbery, spawning regular, large dinners and convinced Bhagirat to stay put.

So the community was opposed to the bulletproof glass and [the city forced the the restauant to not have bulletproof glass, and then after they opened the owner and his family found themselves robbed at gunpoint](https://dcspotlight.com/features/metro-link/southeast-restaurant-robbed-community-rallies-support/):

> Thai Orchid’s Kitchen offers a peaceful environment and good food, but on December 28, 2010 at around 7:50 p.m., three unidentified men terrorized Bhagirat and his family, robbing them at gunpoint.  The experience threatened Bhagirat and the safety of his family.

But! That doesn't mean it's not happening either. If I were a local DC reporter (which I'm not), I'd look at data over time. How many teens committed violent crimes each year since, let's say, 1990? How many teens committed violent crimes in similar-sized cities (or using other comparable variables) this year, or in years past? A big one: *who* are the most likely victims of these types of crimes (for example: Are other teens the victims? Are people who live in a certain ZIP more likely to be the victims? Etc.)?

First off, the ""courtroom"" operates just like with adults, except the sentence upon conviction is ""services.""

In egregious cases like this, unless they're charged as an adult, they're not getting ""locked up,"" at most, they'll go to a camp for a year or so, focused on rehabilitation

Think about that for a second. Services are a penalty to be enforced after ""conviction"".

So then you have public defenders fighting to get the kids off applying the same notion of due process, proof beyond a reasonable doubt, preservation of liberty etc. that we do in adult cases. Except no one's going to jail or paying fines. They're receiving treatment. And we deprive kids of their liberties for their own good all the time, (e.g., mandatory school attendance)

So imagine you're this victim. Possible outcomes are 1) Public defender is successful, nothing happens 2) Kid is ""convicted"" (it's not called that)  and maybe he gets ""services,"" and at most, he goes away to a facility for a year.

I am super strict at home, as are my friends, and yet.....the crap they see on the internet is terrifying and normalized. 3.) The amount of mentally ill people out there is huge and there are virtually zero resources. Therapists and psychiatrists are at least a 12 month waiting list, sometimes 18 months. Parents who were abused and might be battling addictions or have other bad coping skills cannot break free without help. Then their kids enter the same vicious circle.  CPTSD requires years and years of intense therapy and appx. zero people in society are willing to get that for all the poor and homeless that require it. 4.) There are kids out there with bipolar, ADHD, ASD, schizophrenia, et al and they cannot get help - no matter how hard the parents try. Schools just do not care at all.

You might be super fit for an older man but the human body ages no matter what and you're still way more likely than a teenager to blow out your knee, tear a ligament or break a bone in a tussle. That's why the army likes 18 year olds more than 35 year olds. If you plan on battling a teenager you best hope you decisively win the fight in the first 30 seconds cuz after that the teenager will have the advantage.",6,2022,4,2,1

And the real issue is numbers, intervening by yourself against a group is dangerous. Pretty much no one is going to be able to fight 6+ kids, even fucking 13 year olds, without getting beat a bit or worse.

It's not preposterous that everyone around that area is masked up, and you would know this if you commute there. 

At the end of the day masking has nothing to do with being liberal or conservative, it's about protecting your hygiene. Mask wearing is prominent in Asian countries for this reason. If you want to be maskless outside where people can freely move that's fine, but in a tightly enclosed space like the metro I believe wearing a mask is the decent thing to do. It's also the absolute bare minimum -- I'm not even saying everyone needs to be vaccinated or boosted.

I'm not a cynic, and I believe people can change. If you're one of those who think masks can't mitigate the spread of covid, studies indicate the opposite. [The CDC states that cloth masks can block over 80% of fine particles and droplets.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/science-briefs/masking-science-sars-cov2.html) There is also a list of several other studies on this page backing the efficacy of masks.

I'm not sure why I'm being downvoted in my previous comment, but I'm speaking from my experience where I knew when I was hired and accepted the job that my position was classified to get PTO rather than sick and vacation leave. It was commensurate with the total amount of leave provided to coworkers who had sick leave separate and was considered (by me at least) as an advantage to have this flexibility. This classification is made for positions with greater responsibilities, some of which are going to accrue while you are away and be your responsibility when you return from illness or vacation.

I have had very little opportunity to take vacation the past two years and fortunately have avoided illness, and now have a good amount of PTO saved up and hoping for several extended vacations in the next year or so.

The reason the police give for staying in their cars is that it speeds up response times. If you notice cops are also alone, they are rarely paired up. These are all signs of insufficient numbers of patrol officers. 

You are right about NYC its a much safer feeling city despite having about 10 times more people. Flooding the zone visibly does seem to have a deterrence effect also (like in the subways)

I think a solution is going to involve both more visible police presence between u st and shaw in particular and cracking down on establishments that are serving minors, over serving people or allowing for unsafe patrons to go wild, as well as stopping those patrons when they DUI up georgia avenue back to Maryland or down 9th back to Virginia.

In 2004 the neighborhood was THE going out scene, 18th Street would be so crowded that vehicles the road would be clogged with pedestrian traffic.   At last call it was pandemonium.  In the summer muggings of drunk people was a daily occurrence.  

That year an officer was shot pursuing a criminal.  After that there were large amounts of police, at least 20 officers on the street at night on the weekends.   That continued but gradually lessened until COVID... then BLM.

It is shocking to me that during drinking hours there are not more officers out.  

The police nationwide have changed their approach to policing post BLM.  In my humble opinion police are not paid by the arrest, and I think DC metro decided that they are going to not try as hard to arrest and detain suspects, as well as simply not put themselves in harms way.  Why?  because they don't have to - they get paid regardless. 

Every time and officer tries to arrest someone several of those outcomes result in the officer being fired, suspended, killed, or hurt. Only one is good, the suspect surrenders peacefully, and as I said before they aren't being paid a bonus for that.  

You have to really consider what that job is like and how you as a taxpayer and a citizen want them to do their jobs.

Additionally, police should be educated on the law (at least criminal) in a similar manner to law school and undergo deescalation and social service training. Take that 9-18 month police training and and turn it into 2.5 years imo.

Anyways, I do think *some* cops are good and deserve positive recognition. And those cops absolutely do risk their lives if they’re actually doing their jobs. 

Whether it’s traffic management (a Maryland driver could strike at any time), riot control (the ones that defended the Capital from Jan. 6th traitors not the ones that let them in), gang investigation (undercovers could be killed if discovered - we **know** it’s gangs bringing fent into our communities), confronting someone with unlawful use of a gun, saving someone from an abuser, or even some simple traffic stops, the *good* police officers are entering a situation that other professions may lack - an unpredictable and frequently unaccountable variable - other humans.

I’m not going to post clips as proof (they’re on the internet if you’re so desperate to see for yourself), but believe me when I say I have seen bodycam footage of officers responding to situations that should be otherwise safe and peaceful only for the person they are interacting with to suddenly stab or shoot them.

With jobs in agriculture and - to a lesser degree - small engine mechanics, many of the the factors which are dangerous *are* predictable and should be properly accounted for if the job is being performed correctly - many deaths can be avoided by simply paying attention. When you interact with other humans you just have no way of truly knowing how they will react and what their plan is. 

Underwater welders, electrical linesman, and oil-rig workers, however, can prep and account for all they want and they will still frequently die. THOSE are jobs that really truly risk their lives on a day-to-day basis.

Anyways please don’t call me a bootlicker, that’ll hurt my feelings, just trying to offer up another way of looking at it but please understand that I also believe that our country’s current police systems 100% need to be overhauled lol.",2,2024,8,2,1

I have no idea what “sketchy people” means, but this city is pretty homeless friendly and every area of the city has their resident crazies. You will have to learn to get along or ignore these folk or insulate yourself in VA or Cleveland Park. 99% of them don’t mean harm and are just trying to get along. Anywhere that is accessible or fun will have groups of homeless folks for the same reason you want to be there - for your friends, and because it’s fun. 

If you are west of North Cap, basically all parts of DC are as safe as a city with 500k+ people can get. Frankly, East of NOrth Cap isn’t bad once you learn the pockets to avoid. I’ve had more issues in Georgetown, TenleyTown, and Farragut than I have in any other part of the city. 

No one can tell you where you should feel safe, but if you cannot deal with the stranger part of city life than VA is where you want to be.

Mt Pleasant and Columbia Heights anf Cleveland Park are all close to where I grew up especially the first two.

I also don't think it's a good idea to be alone in Malcolm X Park along 16th st after dark either unless you got people with you.  

There is a certain lady that got upset when I told her that months back but hey she is new to the neighborhood and doesn't know what she is talking about.

3500,e14pa7x,8t46ru,Bongo-Fury,"Yes, Mt. Pleasant is more “dangerous” than Cleveland Park. But the statistics don’t do the area justice. Mount Pleasant has a larger population and has greater connection to the rest of the city (it really bleeds into Columbia Heights and Petworth) so it will attract more crime. But really MP is more suburban than most parts of the district; more so than Cleveland Park/TenleyTown which is more gated diplomatic mansions flanked by apartments.  MP is poorer and more diverse, and with that comes more crime, but it also has a stronger community spirit that makes most people I know who live there feel safer than the coldness and isolation of some of DC’s western suburbs.

Cleveland Park is safer mostly because it is in the middle of nowhere with little accessibility, and there is practically no nightlife to speak of. For many people this isn’t a drawback. If you are looking for someplace that is simply safer, it’s a better pick. But aside from some nice restaurants and a (really!) great Italian deli, there is not much of a draw to the area.

Cleveland Park is up a hill, making biking no easy feat.

When I said it was too cold out as a way of indicating I needed to leave and held up my hand to show my fingers were white, he reached out to feel them then asked if I drank coffee or tea. Not wanting to be hit on by someone 10-15 years older I said no. He then asked if we could go for a walk later and I gave a noncommittal response and made my escape.

He was probably late 30s, graying dark hair (don't remember if I saw hair or if he was in a hat and I saw a short beard) between 5'9"" and 6'0"", medium build. Mentioned he had just moved from New York and that he was taking care of his parents, I think.

One day this man and I walked past each other and he asked if there was a good Mexican restaurant nearby. We got to talking, he seemed super normal/respectful/cute and we exchanged numbers. He hugged me goodbye and kissed me on the cheek.

  
He asked me out for a midday walk date the next day. On the walk, he spoke almost entirely in sexual innuendos, said that my dress would be sexy if it flew up and proceeded to lift it up in the back on a very populated street. He ended our walk outside his apartment. He kept talking about different entrances to get in. I went to leave, and he pulled me in to kiss me. I turned and said “not on a first date” and he proceeded to kiss my neck — also on a very public street.

  
He texted later and said I had been a tease. I disengaged, but he kept texting me sexual things for a week. I finally lied and said I was seeing someone. He texted “I don’t give a fuck if you’re seeing someone, NYC girls say I’m the best pussy eater.”

  
Months later, we crossed paths in DC (I had sunglasses on, he didn’t recognize me). He asked “Hey, do you know if this building is really part of XX school?”, I pretended not to hear him. But he shouted, “ma’am? Excuse me?”

That's not how it works and your perspective is seriously warped.

3738,l292pgk,1cfy8o2,Joedirt112,"Cons:

* People on this sub like to tout how walkable/public transport friendly this city is. True, sometimes. But metro stops running super early. Where I live, it'd take me 45+ min to get to Union Station, despite being a 15 min drive. I went to Baltimore for an Oriole's game today - about an hour drive, Transit app estimated 2:25 hours with public transit.

* lack of convenience store/bodega culture. Yeah, there are a few places to grab a snack late-night. But a 15-20min walk each way is not convenient. In NYC, I can go ten steps any direction and find a bodega.

* alcohol laws are stupid as hell. You can't buy beer in gas stations/7-eleven... ok, fine. But not being able to buy a six-pack of beer on a Friday night after midnight is ridiculous.

* Lack of an artistic/creative subculture. Everyone got priced out and moved to Baltimore. Yeah, you can find indie or DIY shows here and there, but only if you actively seek it out and go to the one single place that is hosting something on a Friday night. I wish I could just pop into my neighborhood bar and experience a less square culture. I don't mean to sound like an asshole, but it seems to me that DC is generally much more of a straight-laced, squeeky-clean personality type town than any other city. A lot of my friends come from middle of nowhere Midwest.. Obviously this city is gonna seem incredible compared to that; but there is nothing artsy, punk, or rebellious readily available here, even if some people say there is

* food sucks. There's a lot of good restaurants apparently - I don't know, I can't afford to go to them. There is a SEVERE lack of cheap eats/street food here. The halal place by my house in Columbia Heights charges over $15 for a chicken over rice platter. That's fucking insane!!!! Even with prices going up in NY, I still have never paid more than $8 for the same shit that tastes better and has more food

* Niche, but its too flat and the weather sucks. I want snow in the winter. I want to snowboard in the winter. Closest option? 4 hours to a shit hill in PA or WV. I'm admittedly salty here, but I wish I had more readily accessible cold climates/mountains here.

*No dive bars, no Irish pubs, no neighborhood haunts. Yeah, there are some, but it's just not the same here.


Pros:
* lots of space. More greenery. An average block here is much more open, spacious, and breathable than a random block in Brooklyn. 

* Interesting people - not to contradict myself earlier, but there is something about a city of transplants. I've learned more about the rest of the country than I ever have otherwise since I moved here. I find that amazing. There are also generally a lot of opportunities to experience a different culture here - I didn't know what Malort was before I moved here, but I could go with some midwest friends to Ivy and Coney and get a small taste of their regional culture.

* Sports venues are super easy to get to

* museums, obviously",1,2024,5,2,1

Bought 2 boxes tissues, 1 pack of floss picks, 1 container of vaseline, (1) am/pm combo pack of store brand cold/flu syrup, and (1) container of contact solution. Total came to $60.....$60 fucking dollars for less than a bag full of basic items.

the name brand Dayquil am/pm cold and flu was $40 alone....seriously. 

I completely understand why people are robbing these places and reselling, the corporation is straight up robbing consumers.

I suspect that number is inflated and/or represents total lost products due to shoplifting or other factors (such as accidental damage, etc.). CVS has an incentive to inflate that number to make the problem look worse in order to pressure local governments to subsidize their security. If you think otherwise feel free to check the annual report.

CVS has been penalized over $100 million for wage theft violations over the past 20 years and studies show wage theft is typically recovered at a rate of around 1-2%.  So that works out to $250M - $500M annually. And that’s probably a conservative estimate.

Wage theft is so commonplace and employees are so powerless to fight it, that we often don’t even notice when it happens.

Dugan did not specify how much the casual shoplifters steal in a typical year.  Dugan also did not provide a figure for losses attributable to theft by CVS employees, but that's likely a large number as well.  See, for example:

(1) multiple arrests in DC

(2) an MPD SUV driving up behind a sedan with lights blazing, multiple cops jumping out with weapons and detaining all 4 occupants of the vehicle on the sidewalk

(3) MPD personnel kill someone just outside my apartment at night (I was asleep and did not witness, but could look out my apt window and see the spot a hundred feet away) - https://www.npr.org/local/305/2021/08/27/1031669151/d-c-police-release-footage-following-their-fatal-shooting-of-antwan-gilmore

Law enforcement has been alive and well here since the BLM protests. Traffic enforcement is a double-edged sword in DC because it’s very easy for more harm to come from a chase. Cops have to choose their battles too.

We do need better ticket enforcement for VA and MD drivers who drive here with no regard for safety. That’s a political/state issue though. We also need better technology for tracking stolen cars, or just to do a better job of discouraging driving in DC.

As far as metro jumpers, it’s likely not cost-effective to have police at every metro gate every day. A person jumping is a few dollars lost income. WMATA is now installing new fare gates which can’t be jumped though; you can see them at some stations.

Wage theft is likely the greater wrong in this case in pure dollar amount terms, for the reasons I’ve stated. But it’s also the greater moral wrong because the victim is a real person rather than corporate profits.

And if CVS closes stores in your area, blame CVS, not the thieves. CVS could choose to put people over profit and take measures to keep those stores open (or rather we could write laws that allow CVS to do that), but they don’t.

You can’t have a pharmacy with items to purchase because CVS has decided it’s not profitable to provide that. They’d rather force you to pay for their security.

The reason I harp on wage theft is because I think it matters which crimes we give our attention.  Media attention leads to public focus leads to politician priorities leads to police enforcement.

We spend half a billion per year on law enforcement and yet violent crime continues to rise. 

In my opinion we should focus exclusively on violent crime until that starts to reduce. We can then move to property crime targeted at individuals. If we get both of those under control then maybe we can help corporations protect their assets.

CVS shoplifting losses are less than a tenth of a percent of total revenue annually (.06% in 2022). That’s the equivalent of 60 bucks for someone making $100k.  It’s less than I lose on package theft most years.

You have 1/2 of the information.  Gross revenue.  Now look for ""Gross Losses."" and determine a percentage.  See if it jives what what \*you\* think is for that single store.

Example:

CVS Gross Revenue:

[https://investors.cvshealth.com/investors/newsroom/press-release-details/2023/CVS-HEALTH-REPORTS-STRONG-FOURTH-QUARTER-AND-FULL-YEAR-2022-RESULTS/default.aspx](https://investors.cvshealth.com/investors/newsroom/press-release-details/2023/CVS-HEALTH-REPORTS-STRONG-FOURTH-QUARTER-AND-FULL-YEAR-2022-RESULTS/default.aspx)

2022: $322 Billion

From Al Gore's Internet:

""The country’s largest retail industry group, the National Retail Federation, estimated in its latest report that losses from organized retail theft average $700,000 per $1 billion in sales — or 0.07% of total sales — an amount roughly 330 times lower than the CRA’s estimate.""

Let's check their math:

CVS Gross Sales 2021: $322 Billion

""Siri, how many $700,000's are there in 322 Billion?""

Answer: 322B/$700K = 460,000

""Siri, How much is $700,000? x 322?""

Answer: ""225,400,000.00""

""Siri, expressed as a percentage, how much is $225,400,000/$322 Billion?""

Answer: .07%

.07 % (or seven tenths of a percent) is the total theft loss for ALL of CVS.  Not just one store.  So their math checks out.

Siri: ""What is the slip rate (loss from theft) for the Columbia Heights CVS Store?""

Answer:

[https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/10/03/shoplifting-organized-retail-crime-theft/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/10/03/shoplifting-organized-retail-crime-theft/)

&#x200B;

""The closest tracking comes from NRF; according to its last annual survey, involving 177 retail brands, shrink was responsible for $112.1 billion in losses in 2022. That’s a 19.4 percent spike from the $93.9 billion reported in 2021. More than half of those losses were attributed to employee theft and operational and processing errors, which climbed 29 and 27 percent, respectively.""

Thefore:  If employee theft & operational/processing errors account for (29+27 = 56%) then theft (or ""slip"") accounted for 44% of losses.

$112B x 44% = \~50 Billion in losses in 2021 from people stealing who aren't employees.  And this is an \*industry\* estimate.  Not just CVS or all Pharmacies.

And if employee theft is estimated at 29% (\~$32 Billion) then it seems that corporate wage theft is pretty closely canceled by employee retail theft.",1,2023,10,2,1

I was at Slipstream on that same block around the time of the tweet and had not seen or heard anything; texted a friend who lives literally one building over from the one in De Souza’s picture (facing I St., incidentally), and my friend had similarly not heard or seen anything. Later turned out to be police coordinating for opening day traffic to the stadium, but De Souza never gave any context/update to her photo and the tweet is still up. So she must have been having a slow news day and decided to stir the pot a bit with some half-truths. And it kinda worked: the comments under her post are, of course, entirely unhelpful (about Navy Yard being a war zone), and feature one person blaming crime in the neighborhood on buildings taking renters with housing vouchers. Which, from what I can tell, is the kind of discourse De Souza is aiming to strike up whoever she posts. When again, no crime had occurred in the image she posted.

I don’t have anything against folks keeping their neighbors alert and aware to crime or potentially dangerous activities in their neighborhoods. Navy Yard’s had a few high-profile crimes happen over the last few years, and there’s nothing wrong with wanting to have conversations around what can be done to prevent further incidents. 

But De Souza considerably undermines whatever credibility she may have when she posts to generate fake outrage. As OP said, Yellow had been upfront about their reopening in Navy Yard being temporary because they were planning to open up a new spot elsewhere. Yellow’s own post, which De Souza quote tweeted, says as much.

It's a dumb strawman for people to focus on that derails the question of whether car free spaces is even possible in the first place. I could provide you with a whole list of [places where cars are banned](https://www.bobvila.com/slideshow/pedestrians-only-20-car-free-places-in-america-51840) and then you'd respond with a ""hurrr those places aren't REAL CITIES"" and you'd think you won your strawman.

One post up the person is complaining about driving downtown because there's now too many non car threats to them downtown. The person also responded to the concept of not driving at all in the city (which many commuters and residents do) as completely impracticable.

There are no shortage of cities [around the world](https://archive.curbed.com/2017/5/17/15649210/car-free-places-city-island) and now with the [US](https://www.amny.com/transit/times-square-car-free-1-31982299/) they are proving with proper planning and infrastructure car free/limited cars spaces are possible and practical in parts of cities. That is the point.

4645,h5tjyy6,onh55q,brendanode,"I know a lot of people have chipped in with useful advice but I thought I’d share my experience anyways because it feels relevant 

I was involved in a traffic accident where I wasn’t at fault. I t-boned a car as he tried to make a left turn in front of me and failed to yield. After getting out of my car (I was thankfully ok despite some whiplash) the driver of the car at fault decided to chase me down and attack me, unprovoked except being convinced I caused the crash. He grabbed me from behind and punched my head while I was face down on the ground. A traffic cop witnessed this and pulled him off of me. I was transported from the scene to a hospital and while in the ambulance a police officer asked if I wanted to press charges and I said yes - he shouldn’t get away with violently reacting like that. 

After several weeks of fear given he had my name and address from the citation I was finally able to get ahold of the detective assigned to my case who informed me they decided not to pursue charges. Despite a cop witnessing and this guy having a pretty long rap sheet they felt it wasn’t worth their time. When I asked why they weren’t pushing on prosecuting this guy who committed a violent crime they told me they “didn’t have an answer that would satisfy me”. My alternatives were to sue him myself or let it go, which I did since I just wanted the ordeal behind me. 

I’m not saying this will be your outcome but know they’re apparently working with such limited resources they can opt to not do anything, so just prepare for that possibility.

Policing across the US is pretty much down to video now.  We all like to think that ""detective"" means someone who will actually look for clues ala Sherlock Holmes.

How do I know? Three home invasions (back in my hometown) by the same gang of juveniles, already known to the police.  Lazy legwork by detectives who told me that if I'd had cameras on the property they'd be able to do something.

For a loose boundary, I am thinking of the blocks between Washington Circle and DuPont Circle and those between New Hampshire and Rock Creek Park.  Studios are common and may or may not come with a slightly higher price point than 2k, (for example, the Savoy apartments are packed with GW students who may sublease cheap).  But there is no better location than the West End to access all those things you want to do in that month.  

From the West End you can easily walk/bike to lots of food and drink options (restaurants, bars, Whole Foods, Trader Joe’s), different neighborhoods, including some that have been mentioned (Georgetown, Foggy Bottom, DuPont Circle),  Mother Nature (Rock Creek Park and the Potomac River), and major, must-see sites (The White House, the Kennedy Center, the Smithsonian Renwick Museum and the portion of the National Mall that has the Lincoln Memorial, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, the Korean Veterans Memorial, Constitutional Gardens and the Watergate Steps that overlook the Potomac River).  

For everything else, metro.  You have easy access to all the train lines except for the green and yellow lines.  But those are only a few stops away and you are unlikely to use them much.  It’s better to be close to the orange/blue/silver lines to not only access places in DC that you may want to see, like the Capitol building, National Zoo, and other Smithsonian museums, but you can also easily visit places in Virginia, like Arlington Cemetery, the Pentagon, the Iwo Jima memorial, and the Pentagon City Costco.

If you try to negotiate you’ll hit a brick wall: “the algorithm” rules all.

Every year has been huge increases. Next, there’s been a few security situations in the building and most the front desk people just don’t pay attention, don’t look up from their desk, leave the door unlocked. Their advertised fire places have never been functional in the nearly four years I’ve been here. They’ve seemingly started cutting on costs and the hallways elevators have basically no AC. The gym has been left on heat just about every day since spring and gets to like 80 degrees. They replaced the perfectly fine pool chairs with these orange shit ones that don’t recline because the orange ones look better in photos.

228,l7qorl2,1dafcrg,kneeonball,"Depending on what it is, the most they can reasonably do in most cases is make sure they’re following the law. Anything further can legitimately just be a budget issue that they have to bring up with ownership and the owner can either decide to pay for it or not. Typically budgets are done yearly though, so if it’s a request that has a significant cost, the chances of it being done until that next budget year are lower. 

It’s not necessarily Bozzuto’s fault in this case as a lot of times management companies don’t hold enough power to reasonably change anything. 

Now having a good staff that can relay that to owners is a different question, but it’s still on that owner to okay it or not really. Different ownership groups care different amounts about “extra” things. Your mileage will vary across groups. 

If the ownership group doesn’t want to pay for things, the management group then becomes the “bad guy” and that’s part of what they’re paid for.

If JP Morgan Chase managed all their own buildings, their brand and image get tarnished if things go wrong or they make shitty decisions, but a management company being in the middle takes that off of them for the most part.

The amount of aggression in the DMV area lately seems to be off the charts; aggression, in addition to incompetent, willfully-reckless, driving. 

I have to pull evasive maneuvers multiple times a day, *every day*, just to avoid accidents. Today around Hyattsville, I hit the jackpot as I had to slam my brakes to avoid being side-swiped, then the gas to avoid being rear-ended by the person who hadn’t paid attention to the whole scene. No more than 10 mins later, I had to slam my brakes again to avoid being side-swiped by someone who seemed to be attempting an insurance scam. Drove suspiciously slow, then veered in the lane I traveled as I tried to pass them (their car already had damage on the side that would be impacted if we’d collided).

So far I seem to be able to leave the stress of it all once I’m off the roads, but I wonder if all of this is sustainable for me at all

I’ve already tried to leave the house between 11a and 2:30p (or 7:15p onwards at night), but it hinders me a lot. And even then, traffic seems to creep up into the times I used to be able to drive without too many cars on the road",1,2023,5,2,1

OK, and where do you think the culture part comes from?

When Irish and Italian immigrants had little opportunity for big money jobs in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, they tended to join gangs. They decided at a young age that those gangs were the only realistic opportunities they had to acquire a position of status in their society.

The material conditions have a direct effect on a group's culture in a given community. The culture doesn't magically spring up out of nowhere.

When a 14 year old grows up in an area with a lot of asbestos ridden projects, bad schools, and drive-by shootings, THEN they are more likely to think that they have no chance to make it. If they see older siblings or role models not doing well, THEN there will be a greater tendency for them to think they have should just join a gang.

>According to the 2019 New York City NYC Government Poverty Measure, 23.8% of Asians are in poverty by municipal standards. This is the highest rate of all racial/ethnic groupings, which include White, Black, and Hispanic/Any.

Asian immigrants have a history of finding great success in the U.S. The parents persuade their children to believe that they can make it, and they have figures they can point to in order to prove their point. From a young age it's pretty easy for them to understand that they are a more highly regarded minority and that white students tend to see them as stereotypically smart.

I don't think it's particularly relevant to compare a smaller, self-selected subset of immigrants with broader racial groups. Undocumented immigrants have come specifically to work, and that's at great risk if they commit crimes.

What do you mean by disparity? Again your argument isn't very clear. If you're suggesting Asian Americans have better outcomes than African Americans because they work harder and have better cultural norms, then I disagree. First, ""[a substantial cohort of Asian Americans chose to come here and entered the United States with advanced degrees](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2017/04/andrew-sullivans-perpetuation-of-model-minority-and-black-pathology-myths-is-pretty-boring-at-this-point.html)."" This is a significant factor in the disparity.

Second, Asian Americans and African Americans have not had similar experiences in this country over the past 80 years or so. The premise of your argument seems to be that both have faced the same broad economic disadvantages, and therefore you can't blame economic factors when there's a disparity. However, isn't true. [For example](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2017/04/andrew-sullivans-perpetuation-of-model-minority-and-black-pathology-myths-is-pretty-boring-at-this-point.html):

>""During World War II, the media created the idea that the Japanese were rising up out of the ashes \[after being held in incarceration camps\] and proving that they had the right cultural stuff,"" said Claire Jean Kim, a professor at the University of California, Irvine. ""And it was immediately a reflection on black people: Now why weren't black people making it, but Asians were?""  
>  
>These arguments falsely conflate anti-Asian racism with anti-black racism, according to Kim. ""Racism that Asian-Americans have experienced is not what black people have experienced,"" Kim said. ""Sullivan is right that Asians have faced various forms of discrimination, but never the systematic dehumanization that black people have faced during slavery and continue to face today."" Asians have been barred from entering the U.S. and gaining citizenship and have been sent to incarceration camps, Kim pointed out, but all that is different than the segregation, police brutality and discrimination that African-Americans have endured.

Right now there is a lot of demand for house because people want single family homes out of harms way (if they have a job and the means) but that pool is limited so its reasonable to expect a big housing contraction in next year or so when things shake out but unemployment remains high. The real eviction crisis is only just starting given all the freezes. The landlords who are greedy and kick out all their tenants are going to find they have no way to fill their empty units; better to get an IOU that is enforceable at a lower rate than to have a empty unit now. If we are all lucky we might get a vaccine in Dec/Jan and really see it take hold by March and as the spring comes we might see things starting to return to normal and with that a big boom in jobs in the service sectors that got shut down if enough capital can be put out to jump start all those businesses.

Namely, from a business perspective, if you can swing debt service/maintenance/etc, especially for luxury/new construction, it usually makes sense to leave property empty than to rent for less.

One of the main reasons (and this is likely some of the fallout from DC's even more tenant friendly than normal actions during all of this), is that it's worth staying empty to find the right tenant.

It's rampant in the housing market as well. You can't buy places with formica countertops and that plastic laminate flooring that was easy to clean anymore, everything is granite this and cheap ""snap-together"" flooring that warps easily as soon as a drop of water gets on it. Underneath that the workmanship is shoddy and these units are being cranked out by the lowest bidding subs. I've seen these ""luxury"" homes under construction and they're manufactured like crap. There are a few homes here that were built in the 1700's that would take a colossal amount of money to restore them.

Everyone knows that a civil war is the worst outcome, but lack of trust can make steps toward it rational, until oops, both sides have gone too far and it happens.  

Relying on greed to stop the right is nuts.  In a disputed election neither rightwing leaders, nor, more importantly, their voters (whose opinions you are completely discounting - and most of them are not rich), are going to just roll over and let the Democrats have power.  Particularly when their leader, who has cult-like support from 40% of the country tells them they're being robbed.  So, Republican leaders will line up behind him, hoping that Dems roll over.  But Dems will actually be being robbed (if it comes to this) and their supporters will be outraged also, so they won't roll over.  The radical left will take to the streets, supported by protests the size of which dwarf anything this country has ever seen.  The radical right, armed, will come out in opposition to them, people will die, and the police and the military will get involved to try to quell the disturbances engulfing any place with large populations, or divided populations.  Given the degree the far right has infiltrated and co-opted many police departments and the military, they'll have a natural advantage.

But if Trump is ahead on election night (because tons of Dems vote absentee), and there are some vote counting errors/disputes/very close key areas/credible allegations of hacking (in either direction), etc. - something that makes the election plausibly disputable, even if it's likely Biden won, then think what will happen:  Liberals will take to the streets, and some of them will be angry enough to break things, riot, etc. (a small minority probably, but it will be played up the Republicans and in media).  Trump will order the military out to restore order, and...MAYBE... a few military leaders will resign, but the military as a whole won't refuse to obey orders, because they won't clearly be illegal, unconstitutional, or an outright attempt to illegally hold on to power.  So the military will turn out.  That will enrage liberals more, and certain pro-violence types on all sides (not just liberals, but boogaloos, and rightwing terrorists) will either turn out to combat each other or as a false flag to increase support for a crackdown on liberal protestors.  Republicans will at the same time go to work in the courts to try to shutdown counting in a way that favors them, and their judicial appointees, already biased in favor of Republicans, and feeling the pressure of a nation in incredibly serious crisis will favor them with radical decisions that the judges justify to themselves with the need to resolve this quickly and decisively.

Democrats won't take this lying down, because, objectively, while the counts have not been completed or completed fairly, so no one knows for 100% who won the election, math suggests that Biden very likely did in the electoral college and did decisively in the popular vote.  Nancy Pelosi declares herself the legitimate President as of Jan. 21 until and if the vote counting can be fairly completed.  Trump and the Republicans have already claimed he won, or that, at a minimum, the House must decide the election between Trump and Biden, using the Constitutional procedure where each state gets one vote (and thus Trump would win, despite Dems having a majority of representatives).  

The idea that the military would definitely say with one voice ""Biden is President"" or ""Pelosi is President"" or ""Trump is President"" is wrong.  The situation I described is muddled and anyone can make an argument for their side.  The military doesn't simply go with Biden because he would be a better President - they've stumbled into a situation that they didn't want to be in, don't know what to do, don't know what orders are legitimate, don't know who should legitimately be giving them orders, and don't agree with themselves on any of it.",1,2020,9,2,1

On Neighborhood Scout’s website, you can see the exact numbers they’re using (or at least the numbers they would be using if they made the map today). [Neighborhood Scout reports a violent crime rate of 9.84 per 1,000 people in DC.](https://www.neighborhoodscout.com/dc/washington/crime) It’s hard to tell from the map which city is supposed to be #50, but looking at some of the lighter yellow points on the map, we have:

- [Stockton](https://www.neighborhoodscout.com/ca/stockton/crime) (12.59)

It’s interesting to note that DC is in the list of top 100 most dangerous, at #80. If you want to know how the data is sourced + analyzed, there is an explanation here - https://www.neighborhoodscout.com/faq/top100dangerous

I think it’s important to look at statistics instead of gut feelings when looking for the truth. I’ve lived in 2 of the cities in the top 50 most dangerous (from 2022) for 20+ years and while I knew there were “bad areas of town” in both places, I never felt unsafe living there.

2) extreme dysfunction. different prosecutors for juveniles/adults. no functioning crime lab. no functioning 911 system. no monitoring of people on GPS monitors. people bailing on bonds and getting away with it. no monitoring of probation. no enforcement of illegal car tags. no consequences of students being truant. etc",70,2023,12,2,1

DC comes in at 140 with a violent crime rate of 7.45 per 1000 population.

That said, I'm getting a different list than they did because they used 2021 data. Which is why, when using UCR data, you typically want to pull five years of UCR data and average over the five years, because especially in smaller jurisdictions (which you'll note make up a lot of the cities listed) one year of higher crime due to some non-repeating factor (burglary spree, etc) can drive a city up in the rankings beyond its typical spot.

1224,kcuwhod,18ewlpw,harkuponthegay,"It depends on what you mean by “size”.

According to the census bureau Richmond has a total area of 62 sq mi (160 km2), of which 60 sq mi (160 km2) is land and 2.7 sq mi (7.0 km2) (4.3%) is water. Meanwhile, DC has a total area of 68.34 square miles (177 km2), of which 61.05 square miles (158.1 km2) is land and 7.29 square miles (18.9 km2) (10.67%) is water. 

So both places are almost identical in terms of square miles of land— now take Richmond’s murders and spread them over that space and you get about 1 murder per square mile. But if you take DC’s murders and spread them over its space you get 4.20 murders per square mile. 

Meaning that in DC you are much more likely to have had a murder committed within one square mile of where you live during the year than if you lived in Richmond. Which makes it feel far less safe to some people. 

And that brings up an interesting distinction— which city feels less safe and which city actually is less safe? The answer is not as obvious as dividing murders by population— because in reality it is highly dependent upon who you are. 

The people that are being murdered are overwhelmingly young black men of lower socioeconomic status. So if you are a black man living in wards 7 or 8 these numbers mean something different to you than if you are a white woman living in ward 2.",-3,2023,12,2,1

I personally don’t think the DC housing market is as stable as everyone thinks, especially in developing areas without strong schools, so there is a chance that your home value could drop. 5 years is usually the amount of time it takes for homeownership to be better financially than renting. Are you going to be/do you want to be in DC for 5 more years? Do you want children? If so when and how is the school in your area? What I am saying is that homeownership plants you there for much longer than renting does. 

You will now be responsible for renting out the basement and maintaining to a higher standard than what the previous owners had since you will literally lord over the tenant. DC tenant laws are very strict. You will need to set up a business to rent out to tenants, it isn’t particularly difficult but it does cost money. You will also need to set up a way to process their rent, which unless they are paying check or cash, usually involves another cost. Since they are in your basement, be prepared to deal with them over every minor issue and be absolutely sure that you want to rent to them. Because they will walk up and knock on your door if there is a problem. Remember, you can’t just leave the apartment now and move to another place if you don’t like your neighbors.

1238,ly8xbqu,1gvokxm,Independent_One2052,"Hello, I’m a DC realtor, lender, homeowner, and landlord.

First, TOPA - no it does not fall under TOPA anymore unless there are 4+ units or someone is elderly or disabled.  The law changed, whereas every tenant used to have topa rights and there was a bit of a process to comply with the law it is pretty simple now. You are required to send them a form notifying them if they are elderly or disabled they have TOPA rights but assuming they are not, that is all and as long as they do not assert their rights as elderly or disabled TOPA Is moot.

Second, programs.. yes the most common is DC’s HPAP .. however it is income restricted so if you make too much it would not be available.  The max income for a 2 person household to receive any assistance is $136,100 so if you gross over that it’s out.  If you are DC government employees there is the EAHP which offers less assistance but otherwise is the same program for DC employees and can be combined with HPAP.  The big downside to the HPAP is that it comes with the stipulation that the home remains your primary residence so if you want to upgrade or move away, selling is your only option to keep things on the up and up vs a normal loan you can move out and rent it and make it an investment property in the future.  The HPAP is also not a grant, but a deferred no interest loan so your initial payment will go up once the deferral period ends.  There are other programs out there, DC open doors, lender sponsored DPA, etc but what I tell people is generally there’s no free lunch.  If you have a minimum down payment and decent credit a traditional loan is usually the way to go.  The only exception to that “no free lunch” rule is sometimes there are actual grants, they typically come with stipulations such as you must buy in certain zip codes, make under certain incomes etc to where they don’t work for most people.

FHA loans - generally the main downside of the FHA loans are the up front mortgage insurance which I tell clients “are essentially points”.  The upfront premium is 1.75% and the minimum down payment for a standard fha loan is 3.5% so you put down 3.5% but initially owe 98.25%.  (There are 0% down options that come with lender overlays but the interest rate gets jacked up so most people find them unattractive unless the minimum down payment is truly not doable) Another downside is you cannot get rid of the monthly mortgage insurance without doing a refinance (unlike conventional loans).  This aspect is less of a detractor now than it was a couple years ago as everyone is expecting rates to drop and bring able to refinance, however, no guarantees .  Generally FHA loans are best for buyers with sub-700 credit that can’t get approved for conventional loans or where the rate is too high on conventional due to their fico or dti.

In terms of being a landlord DC Is very tenant friendly so my best advice is to always screen, screen, and screen some more for good tenants because a bad tenant can be a nightmare and nearly impossible to get out quickly and affordably.     It is far better to leave the rental vacant for a couple months and continue searching for a quality tenant than to rent it to the first sub par applicant that comes along IMO.  

 In terms of keeping everything on the “up and up” you will need a rental license (BBL) from the city if the basement is an entirely separate unit.  If it is a completely separate unit and the current owner does not have a BBL it’s an “illegal rental” which sounds scary but honestly the city generally is not cracking down on them, however it could still bite you if you need to take the tenant to court.  In fact since it appears the whole house is rented there really should be a minimum of 1 BBL, if not 2 depending how the house and leases are configured.  There could be a reason such as ceiling height below 7’, lack of egress or another reason it can’t be approved.. just so you’re aware.  A lot of government/military are very concerned with having everything legal so otherwise identical houses, one with a legal basement rental and the other with an illegal basement rental can be valued a bit differently.. so it affects marketability.  Separate utility metering is another item that most basement rentals do not have but improves value if it does.

1244,ly46c31,1gvokxm,Bennieboop99,"""Second category, what do I need to know before taking on being a DC landlord to my basement neighbor""?

To legally rent out your basement apartment in DC, you’ll need two things:

1. **Basic Business License (BBL).** This is a document that basically ensures the safety of both you and your renter by giving you the right to do business (yes, even if you’re just operating as a landlord in your own home!).
2. **Certificate of Occupancy.** This is a document that verifies your unit is safe for renting. To obtain this certificate, you’ll need to have your basement pass inspection; otherwise, your rental will be considered illegal. You must have a Certificate of Occupancy before you can get a BBL.

To pass inspection, your basement apartment will need a few things. First, the ceilings will need to be at least seven feet high (for habitable spaces), have two ways of safely exiting the apartment, and have separate heating and cooling.

As you can see, renting your basement in DC isn’t quite as simple as giving it a new coat of paint and putting an ad online!",2,2024,11,2,1

It takes some work and common sense but most people who do it like myself figure it out. My recommendation is to find an amazing realtor, that’s a great first step. If the house is already leased then there is nothing to decide unless their lease expires as those do convey. In terms of topa that no longer applies if the landlord only manages a few units so not guaranteed. If you’re interested you should message the current owner as it might save them tens of thousands in realtor fees if they know you’re interested and could help with negotiations.

1) DC has a suite of first time homebuying programs with varying restrictions and hoops to jump through. I purchased through DC Open Doors about 5 years back. I've heard it isn't as great of a deal now, but I really don't know enough. Some banks also offer promotional, first-time home buyer loans that are portfolio loans (as opposed to conventional vs. FHA), depending on things like the census tract you're buying in. Talk to a mortgage lender who is familiar with all these programs-- I recommend someone at First Home Mortgage.

2) I don't think the tenant in your ADU actually qualifies for TOPA tenant rights, but I could be wrong here. I also rent a condo out and have talked to a realtor about selling it in the past; in my case, the tenant doesn't qualify for TOPA rights, but the realtor was concerned about the extra steps involved when selling a unit that's occupied-- particularly on the title side of things. 

3) Speaking of being a landlord, DC makes it rather easy to register as a business and be a single-unit landlord. It's not terribly expensive either. But it a whole extra set of things to care about-- from taxes to licensing to handling repairs, tenant issues, etc. YMMV renting out an ADU, but I really don't make much of anything on the condo I rent out after everything (HOA, insurance, savings for repairs, etc.) is all paid out.",1,2024,11,2,1

**Howard University**

* Shaw is walkable, but it can be hard to find something affordable

* Columbia Heights is vibrant and more affordable, but it’s a bit of a walk to campus

**Catholic University of America**

* Silver Spring is just up the Red Line and has a lot of what you’re looking for

* NoMa is the same in the opposite direction, but is a little more connected to the rest of the city

**George Washington University**

* Foggy Bottom has lots of good housing options

* West End is basically overflow for Foggy Bottom, so check there too

* I know people who go to GW and live in Crystal City, Rosslyn, or even Tysons for the cost and community, so if commuting is your thing then maybe consider those

**Georgetown University**

* Foxhall Village is close if you can find a place

* Living in Georgetown proper is your best bet here, despite the cost, simply due to how difficult it is to commute

**University of the District of Columbia**

* Bethesda is a good option because of metro access

* Adams Morgan is a little pricy but could be a good place to look

**Gallaudet University**

* NoMa is super close and a nice place

* Near Northeast has a bunch of stuff, and the closer to H Street or 8th Street the better

She said no, and then Cooper shot a warning shot into the ceiling — which led to Mahoney running into the hall.

The neighborhood is pretty quiet compared to where we used to live in Eckington. We live on 20th, and it is very, very quiet, hardly any foot or car traffic except for locals. 19th Street seems to be a little nosier since it is the entrance to the neighborhood from the bus and street car, it is also a through street up to Maryland avenue; also 19th and Benning is a pretty active corner. Our neighbors are very friendly and are mix of an older generation who have lived here for years and a younger generation moving in. 

We frequently go out on H street and feel safe walking to the street car or bus to go out. However like some already mentioned we almost always grab an uber/lyft home instead of walking home from the street car when we stay out late at night.

We do hear the occasional gun shots at night, but they are usually east on 21st Street. We feel we got good value for the home we bought compared to similar size houses in neighborhoods we could no longer afford.

>Abstract

>Noise is unwanted and/or harmful sound, first recognized as a public health hazard in 1968. The Noise Control Act of 1972 declared that “it is the policy of the United States to promote an environment for all Americans free from noise that jeopardizes their health or welfare.” The promise of that legislation remains unfulfilled 50 years later. Human exposure to harmful noise levels is widespread. Major sources include transportation, military aircraft and combat operations, noisy recreational vehicles, industrial machinery, recreational and leisure activities, outdoor power equipment, consumer products, and, possibly, wind turbines. Loud noise causes hearing loss and tinnitus and can contribute to non-auditory health problems. Chronic noise, even at low levels, can cause annoyance, sleep disruption, and stress that contribute to cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, metabolic disturbances, exacerbation of psychological disorders, and premature mortality. Noise interferes with cognition and learning, contributes to behavior problems, and reduces achievement and productivity. The health of more than 100 million Americans is at risk, with children among the most vulnerable. Noise-related costs range in the hundreds of billions of dollars per year. Yet, the United States has no federal standards for non-occupational noise exposure. Federal standards for occupational noise exposure from the 1970s address only hearing loss as an adverse health effect and do not apply to all workers (e.g., those in agriculture and construction). Calls for action have gone largely unheeded.",24,2022,3,2,1

2151,i1vkvjd,tkyf41,saltyjohnson,"I agree with you generally, except FAA regs tend to avoid the word ""shall"" when it comes to dictating how a pilot operates their aircraft. FAA regs are very clear that the [pilot in command is the final authority as to the operation of their aircraft](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-91#p-91.3(a)). Even if a pilot deviates from a direct instruction from ATC, the only thing that the pilot ""shall"" do is notify ATC of the deviation and their next intentions as soon as possible. That's not to say that there won't be disciplinary actions taken against the pilot if an investigation finds that the deviation wasn't prudent, but that stuff waits until the pilot is on the ground so they can focus on operating their aircraft.

Thus, ""expected to"" is nearly equivalent to the word ""shall"" except that it leaves the window open for the pilot to deviate if they feel it's necessary. ""Expected to"" means that if ATC clears you to operate along a given route and does not state a specific altitude, you are cleared to operate at the maximum altitude charted. Again, if the pilot feels they must deviate for some reason, they are within their rights to do so. ""Shall"" would be more appropriate in the case of ""A pilot shall not enter prohibited area P-56"" because if you violate that direction, you're liable to be subject to lethal force. However, 14 CFR 73 still doesn't even say ""shall not"", rather sticking with what I'd think to be less severe [""you may not""](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-E/part-73/subpart-C/section-73.83) language.",4,2022,3,2,1

And, this would require helicopters to fly at say 1000 feet instead of the say around 300 or 400 feet they must be at when I can, from my 10th floor apartment, look almost directly into the face of the pilot of a passing First Squadron Huey purchased during the Vietnam War.

We included some of your comments in this story. Here's a little preview of our list, written by Sophia Solano:***

Perhaps more than anything else in this fractured world, pizza is a point of consensus. It’s perfect for a kid’s birthday bash or an on-the-go lunch between calls, as well-suited to grace a silver platter at a fancy cocktail party as it is plopped on a paper towel for a whirl in the microwave. Everyone, it seems, can agree on pizza.

Unless you live in D.C.

Around here, pizza is very, very divisive.

Our city — littered with New York and Midwestern transplants who have strong opinions on what makes a respectable pie — has never gained a reputation as a great pizza town. While other cities get entire styles named in their honor, we get the crumbs.

Despite all that, there is truly great pizza in the DMV — if you know where to look. We set out on a journey to find it, with our readers at the wheel.

What follows is a list of the best pizza joints in the Washington area, based on the opinions that matter most: those of our readers. Next time you’re hungry for pizza, seek out one of these shops. Their pies are as delicious as they come; we’re sure you’ll agree.

***20: We, the Pizza***

The original Capitol Hill shop, frequented by school and tour groups, has grown to include We, the Pizza locations as near as Arlington and as far as Clearwater Beach, Fla. In addition to dozens of dining options (including a divisive honey ham and pineapple pie), the sodas are crafted with homemade syrups, and the Ballston location offers gelato shakes.

“We The Pizza is my favorite,” wrote one Reddit user. “Their Ultimate Cheese \[tomato sauce, fontina, taleggio and mozzarella\] with the pesto oil drizzle makes my heart all a-flutter.”

***19: Jumbo Slice Pizza Mart***

There’s a misconception among the young and, well, drunk that “jumbo slice” refers to any of the several pizza joints dotting the streets of Adams Morgan after midnight on a weekend. It’s no wonder — the term even has its own Wikipedia page. But only one restaurant, if you’re kind enough to call it so, actually holds the name “Jumbo Slice.” Whether our polled readers referred to that stop or its greasily delicious posers remains a mystery. Even those who jumped into a discussion on the best Washington pizza expressed some ambiguity: “I think Jumbo Slice, right?” wrote a Reddit user who asked to be identified as Mike D. “Or is it just because it’s usually 2 a.m. when I’m eating it? I don’t really know.”

***18: Della Barba***

Most pizzerias stick to making just one or two styles of pie. But Della Barba, a former Union Kitchen start-up, proves that more options does not mean less attention to detail. Founder (and former defense attorney) Joey Barber offers four types of pies in the styles native to Detroit, New York, Chicago and your own oven, otherwise known as “nonna” or “grandma-style.”

“Don’t sleep on the nonna crust,” wrote Post reader Karen Wilson Roman. “But all the crusts are delicious.”

I think the main issue with DC bagels is that they are often too white in appearance (whether that is them being under baked or not boiled long enough, IDK).\* Other minor differences I've noticed is that maybe ours are too dry as dough - the best NYC bagels I've had are still very good untoasted b/c the interior is moist and plump.

I had a similar incident when a man started to speed walk down the escalator to stand just right beside me. He then tried to raise his arm in front of me, holding a bag of some sort in his hand. When I noticed this I took a quick look back only to see him staring at me without saying a single word. Creepy as fuck.

I'm sure now that it's probably a case of mental illness, and really god knows what he would've done if I waited any longer. I threw away all pretext of civility and just booked it down the escalator and reported him to the first station agent I saw. The guy then finally started talking and raised a huge attitude about ""whatever the hell"" I had told the station agent. 

I managed to slip away as the station agent tried to calm down the man in order to defuse the situation, but it was very disturbing.

Regardless, the person who scratched the car showed lack of respect for another persons property. Why not just leave a note venting whatever they have to say instead of etching in their car?

What ProTimFanning said is exactly what I was going to say to your question. With body panels being made out of fiberglass, aluminum, and carbon fiber (such as Z06) it is a much tougher process to correct dents and scratches. Sometimes when dealing with things like carbon fiber it just is not fixable.  Also, nowadays most body shops just replace the whole body panel instead of trying to do paint correction for deep scratches to bare metal or really bad dents.

If you want to learn more about the process of fixing a keyed car this video is very in depth and good. If you don't watch the whole video the first two mins should give you an idea the labor intensive process of fixing something like this.

1. Civil servants have a lower rate of top-ranked universities than you'd expect (most of those graduates go into the private sector)
2. Contrary to what you said, not every relevant leader here went to an elite university - relatively few of them did, particularly in this administration

I used to go out 2-3x/week for dinner, drinks, etc; now it’s once every 4-6 months. It’s just not worth it anymore between the lower quality food, service, and insulting service fees. And the fear of walking outside in this city is a clincher for me. I recently walked to get take out and had two guys following me. I had to literally run away. This was on a well lit Main Street too. 

 My favorite thing about DC is how walkable it is. I used to feel I could safely walk home late at night, even if it was 2-3 miles, pretty much any hour of the evening. Now I don’t feel safe walking outside at night for more than a block or two. It’s not just the violent crime. It’s also that people drive so recklessly. I’ve seen people speed 60 MPH on my neighborhood street. I’ve had my car hit by a reckless speeder going 50 in a 25 (maryland plates of course). And the city refuses to crack down.

> ""We feel that we ... have been absolutely abandoned by the city,"" McDonnell had written in his email. ""The crime and safety issues in that neighborhood are out of control.""
***
> In the original email, McDonnell detailed how his employees had been punched, pepper sprayed, had guns and knives pulled on them, spit on, and had to watch as ""customers have literally tried to kill each other."" He added that one of their employee's sons, who worked nearby, was robbed and murdered – leaving his team distraught about the loss and about the situation in the neighborhood.

> ""All of the above needs to be understood in the context of the lack of police presence. There is none,"" McDonnell wrote. ""Once upon a time there was. 911 calls, if they come at all, take 15-20 minutes. When they do arrive, it seems as if they feel they can’t do anything.""

After WUSA9 found out about this and contacted the management, the management released a public letter saying it was happy with how it's addressing this. In the best case scenario, crime was actually terrible but Clyde's is genuinely happy with the efforts to address that. In the worst, the private communication is how Clyde's actually feels, and the statement of praise that was released immediately after the September letter was a face saving measure (perhaps not to upset the government, perhaps not to scare away patrons). If you're going by the idea that we can't trust what corporations are saying publicly, as it's just a way for them to get public opinion to go in the direction they want, I'm not sure why you'd trust the public letter over the private communication.

Chokeholds have always been against MPD policy but the most recent policy re-iterating that has made it against the law to have incidental neck touches. This doesn’t specify an intended neck touch, but instead, any touch of the neck inducing pressure on them with no measure of degree. This includes pulling of a shirt, brushing against the neck, or any other incidental action causing contact with the neck. This results in an administrative actions putting the members career at risk, a trial board, the member at possibility of criminal charges, and more. A lot of members have already faced suspension over such incidental touches while this most recent policy has been enacted. So why put hands on anyone to effect an arrest or a stop? Why risk your life when almost every other bit of the system is working against law and order?

People have been suspended for this left and right, and it’s not for what you claim. People get fired or charged for that kind of negligence resulting in death in DC.

There have been several attorneys and prosecutors that I’ve spoken with that simply don’t feel comfortable with MPD because MPD has a reputation of pumping out poorly trained officers who can’t write, speak or testify well at all.

This included the Groups Save McMillan Park and Friends of McMillan Park. 


 This is unhinged: D.C. activist Adam Eidinger and anti-imperialist organization Code Pink planned the event in honor of Ariel Vegosen of Code Pink’s birthday. She travelled to Palestine, Turkey, France, Italy, Greece, and then back to Palestine before returning stateside on Friday. For Vegosen, the festivities were a way to culminate her time abroad, and draw connections between global struggles, whether “Palestinians working every day to overcome occupation” or the planned development of McMillan Park. “Our existence here is a form of resistance,” she says of the party’s location.


 Other brilliant ideas included turning the site into an underground concert venue 🤦‍♂️


Or this ""idea"":


Yet another group wants the site to be used for urban farming. The McMillan Coalition for Sustainable Agriculture, a “group of citizens living around the McMillan Reservoir,” wants to build a urban aquaponic farm in the caverns underneath the site to grow and harvest vegetables and seafood. In a release, the MSCA says that their campaign is at risk because of the city’s desire to turn the site into mixed-use development.",2,2024,7,2,1

And yes, some of our members DID oppose any development on the site, which I personally disagreed with, but diversity of thought and opinion was welcomed by all within the group, even the characters that frequently get made the face of the organization. But the one thing that ALL of us in Friends of McMillan wanted was a feasibility study conducted by a non-involved third party (the city conducted their own) and a design competition befitting the uniqueness of the site. I think the site has now, after many changes in design (again, hard won by the same people you denigrate) been developed beautifully and I’m excited to use it. But does it erase the fact that the city sole-sourced a massive project to a developer who created the most boring vision possible, losing 20 acres of undeveloped land at a pittance of $9M? No, nothing will ever change that and I still think it’s a disgrace. Ask 100 people who supported the as-proposed development at McMillan if they had any idea about the giveaway of public land and lack of competition and 98% of them had no idea, AND furthermore supported the idea of a competition.

Dakota Ave., 3 blocks from RI Ave.  It's on a huge lot. It has the potential for adding up and out.

If it was pretty that would be an attractive purchase for a rental. Except it's not pretty. But I don't see deterioration, just, so far, neglect.

The tipping factor is, of course, the down payment. For the sake of argument lets say the seller will take $400 grand. If so, there's your 20%, on paper, down payment.

In the 1950s, the farm around them sold and was developed into a post-war suburban neighborhood, with the standard quarter acre lots. They were smack dab in the middle of where the development wanted to build a road, but they refused, and so one of our main neighborhood streets abruptly ended at the edge of of their property, now heavily wooded, and containing two houses. 

By the late 1980s, the neighborhood started to be gentrified, and as the homes sold off, were razed to the ground and McMansions put in their place. Now about half my old neighborhood are huge homes that are built almost right up to the property line with barely any yard space to speak of. My school chum's parents eventually sold off the property they lived on for some ungodly amount of money based on property alone.  I think several million per acre. Now it's some ""luxury townhome"" complex with homes selling for 1-1.4 million a piece (according to Zillow, which might be overinflated).",14,2022,3,2,1

There is a huge drug problem in the homeless population on the west coast, the most vocal of the left spend their time campaigning that ""it is a health problem, not a crime problem."" And that is absolutely true, but they are advocating for a problem, not a solution. And they have successfully advocated for a problem, not a solution. That is wearing a left-leaning idea as a fashion accessory, it's virtue signaling. The real virtue would be to think hard about a real solution, the sacrifices that need to be made to get there, the grim and uneasy discussions about how to solve drug-related mental health issues. Maybe, stop closing down psychiatric institutions, possibly open more. What do we do if a person in clear ongoing distress refuses help? What do we do if they become a danger to society?

If you read the replies that the root commenter made, what are they? ""Well the system is too slow."" It's waxing lyric about problems.

Where the fuck did I say that?  I'm just not stupid enough to think that giving a junkie a minimum wage job will magically cure them of addiction.  For a lot of people, they're homeless precisely because they're addicts and can't hold a job.  These are the same sort of people who need free narcan that the city provides.

>Do you have semblance of an idea on what personal responsibility means in this world? On what being an adult is? And that yes, eventually, decisions have consequences?

I think you're inferring something from my post that I never said nor ever meant.

My point was that giving a junkie a job and a roof over their head won't do anything.  Junkies either are homeless because they became too addicted and couldn't hold a job or they became homeless through other factors, became addicted to drugs to cope and now can't hold a job.  A lot of these addicts likely don't even want a job, you can't give someone something they don't even want.  I don't know what the solution is because I don't care enough to figure one out, if I had one, I'd run for office.

These people won't become productive members of society until they get clean and/or get treated for their severe mental illness (a person who yells and talks to themselves can't hold a job either...also, and I'm going on a hunch here, they likely wouldn't want a job anyway).

Leave the kids alone and let them enjoy their summer. Its the city and there is no other space to ride. You should be cautious of your surroundings, period. You can’t lallygag mindlessly. 

Plus, this is a public policy thing. The city builds bike lanes and skate parks. Why isn’t there a designated area for them.

Tax money is taking and now builds random arches over bridges , new stadiums , bike lanes , and MORE buildings with 800 sq ft living space that’s cost $3000 a month. Instead of contributing to our schools and investing into the youth of the city they are knocking down historical land marks to the African American community.

At some point they are not going to give a damn ESPECIALLY with all the gentrification ,accommodating new comers and trying to push out its original citizens.

Wether the police can chase or not they will not let up and the mayor is smart for creating the no chase law. MPDC majority of the time enjoys the show , some are natives by the way and would rather this than violence. I would rather be annoyed in traffic then to hear yet another story of an African American male , woman , or child killed. I would rather sit in traffic on 295 because of bike life than it be because of a shooting on 295. People forget D.C is a city just like NY is a city !

This escalation of dangerous shit is why I'm posting, period. It's not about the occasional gang of atvs/dirt bikers that come through a few times a day. It's about a constant stream of it over a significant period of time. They themselves are blocking and slowing down traffic, while also endangering every car, driver, cyclist, and pedestrian near them.

Agree that traffic sucks, but there have already been proposals to regulate/charge a toll for access to downtown DC, like they do for central London, to reduce traffic and promote pedestrian access/bicycle usage. So that's why I suggested those options.

 In my post, I agree that DC needs to consider a designated location for these riders, but even if it exists, the thrill and joy comes from riding on the streets and posturing in front of pedestrians and yes, even the police. 

These kids are not DC kids enjoying their summer. These are kids driving in from MD, where there ARE designated dirt bike tracks, who come into DC to cause chaos and show off. 

Yes, police chases have caused rider deaths, which is why police chases were banned.

But since the car chase ban, there have been multiple incidents of pedestrians being killed or maimed as well as car accidents all caused by illegal off-road vehicle drivers.

Also no such agreement.  You might be thinking of the vehicle exception to the warrant requirement under case law.  PC is still needed.

The case law that decided this was US v. Antoine Jones and was based on a D.C. case.  The takeaway from that case is that warrants are required to attach a GPS to a suspect vehicle.  There are issues that were unanswered with the case but that’s how I interpret it and I’m sure how the US Attorney/OAG would too.

Unfortunately, after all the articles/posts I've read about this issue, I actually do not think that people smarter than us, lawmakers or otherwise, have actually tried to do anything about this. That's what I'm particularly incensed about.

Regarding the traffic cameras, it's the only way that MPD can track down the offenders because of the no chase policy. From what I've read, around 50%+ of these off road vehicles are actually stolen, so it's the only way they can enforce the law. The act of riding illegally in DC streets is a misdemeanor and carries up to a $250 fine (but no one's ever been fined that much), and if they can't pay the $50-$150 that they're typically fined, then it comes with up to a 12 day stint in DC jail, which is again waived because it's a misdemeanor and DC Jails are way overstuffed.

So, if we had the cameras, at minimum we can hope to confiscate illegal/stolen off-roading vehicles.

I’ve also done similar activities organized by hostels etc while traveling (for example, a combination bar crawl and scavenger hunt) and I’ve seen bachelorette parties do them as well, but I’m going to assume neither of these options are correct given the people who approached your friend were sober.

— Dupont/Kalorama ≈ Kensington/Notting Hill. With upscale row houses and home to most of the embassies, this is a relatively peaceful/upscale area. Tons of restaurants, bars, shops, and a weekly farmers market kinda gives DuPont a notting hill vibe.

— Adams Morgan (AdMo) ≈ Camden. AdMo is pretty hipster/offbeat for DC standards (though not at the level of Takoma Park), with its main stretch on 18th street featuring a wide mix of shops, restaurants, and nightlife. 

— U Street/Shaw ≈ Shoredtich. Lots of bars. Like AdMo, this is a top destination for young people to go out on weekends. Good place for live music as well with several of DC’s top venues (9:30 club, Lincoln Theater).

— Georgetown ≈ Knightsbridge. Very posh, known for the University and it being DC’s shopping hub. With its variety of stores, also reminiscent of SoHo.

— NoMa/H Street Cordidor ≈ Brixton. An interesting mix of grit with new developments. Street art and interesting restaurants give the area a creative energy. Also home to Union Market (the closest thing DC has to Borough/Camden). 

— Navy Yard ≈ Canary Wharf. Brand new and a little ways out, feels very different from the rest of DC. Surging in development of apartment complexes and restaurants/bars. Not known for being a business hub like Canary Wharf, though; it’s the home to the Washington Nationals (city’s baseball team)",56,2021,11,2,1
4505,hkvn0ha,qv8awv,leffbehind,"Hi OP! As someone who moved from London to DC after grad school I hope I can give you a good perspective of everything here in DC. 

1. DC is *significantly smaller* than London. Anyone who has been to NYC/LA/SF will also tell you this, but from one seat of government to another, you will quickly realize that DC is a tiny fraction of the size of London. However, what's nice is that DC (in some areas) actually seems quite dense and slightly similar to European cities.
2. Public Transit will be good - in the context of transit in the US. European cities have decades of developed infrastructure for folks who don't have cars and the US is very much the opposite. DC however is one of the most walkable cities in the US and there are a host of different public transit options, as long as you are not to snobby to ride the bus (Moving from London where I bussed or tube everywhere I never understood some DC residents' need to turn their nose up at the busses.)
3. For your budget you will have plenty of options and, I would also aim for the West End (not much there, and a bit too close to college students at GW)/Dupont/Kalorama/Adam's Morgan/west of Logan Circle axis. These areas are *relatively* low crime, quiet, walkable, have plenty of shoppes and eateries, and you can meet new people. **However, noise level varies extremely based on the individual unit and the street(s) that it faces.** This is not satisfying, unless you have a buddy here already, but if you can - **tour the unit and linger as long as you can** ***in the unit*** **to accurately gauge the noise level of the individual unit.** I currently live in a building with a gorgeous unit that faces one of the loudest street corners in DC and will be moving next month out of Columbia Heights because of it - yet folks who live on the other side of the building have quiet and serene living spaces.
4. What may appear odd to you and will seem normal to most Americans is how DC, an urban city, has a *completely random arrangement of completely residential blocks* interspersed throughout the city (things like Swann St. NW). These are very cute and if you can manage to find a ground floor (not basement) unit in one of these in your price range, that is the golden ticket.
5. The weather is similar, but on the whole, better than London. The amount of days where it just lightly rains all day long (my most hated part of London) is relatively small. Summers in DC will be more humid and a bit hotter, and I'd actually say the winters are comparable. In general about 15-30% less rain and it's usually harder and quicker in duration.
6. Lots of churches, like, a lot, even considering that London has been inhabited since Roman times, DC has probably 20x the churches of London
7. Dogs Dogs Dogs - DC has very quickly become a city of dog-owners. This is I think a relatively recent advent in DC greatly accelerated by COVID, but there will be many many more dogs here, which I as a pet owner, love.
8. DC residents think they have a lot of rats/mice - they have never lived in London :D.
9. Do not believe anyone who says an ""Irish Bar/pub"" is good in DC, I am yet to find one.
10. U St. is generally too loud and busy, but there are quiet bubbles to be found. 
11. NoMa is still being gentrified/redeveloped in a piecemeal fashion so certain parts of it are very modern (and people love it) and other parts are very urban blight/empty lots/crime - and *it is far from the various other centers of DC young/exciting/interesting life except for the H St. corridor/Eastern Market.* 
12. Now I'll also give you an additional random list of trade offs:
   1. Higher Priced items in DC: 
      1. Theatre/Events tickets - Yes there are opportunities to get free/cheap tickets with good seats, but I went to a massive amount of plays, ballets, musicals, concerts, etc. in London for a nice chunk cheaper than here in DC. 
      2. Gym memberships - These are treated like a luxury good in DC and while there are some that have various tiers of pricing, you will likely get a bit of sticker shock - When I lived in London a new gym opened within 1-3 tube stops every 4-5 months, making pricing competitive. Gyms in DC are run/owned by about 4-6 companies who have no incentive to have competitive pricing (Avoid WSC if you can) -
      3. Healthcare - I will not bore you with the details, but it's a lot more expensive and it's something **you will need to budget for** unless you work at a tech company that pays all your premiums (this is rare, but happens)
   2. Cheaper items in DC
      1. Museums - London is good, but I'd argue that DC's got it beat on the massive volume of free museums/art galleries and the like
      2. **Housing - what you can afford for 2500 in DC will be palatial, modern, clean and in a great neighborhood compared to London flats.**
      3. Groceries - The difference here is not large, but it is enough that you will notice your spend at Harris Teeter/Safeway/Giant is probably slightly cheaper than your standard London Tesco. This scales so M&S prices>Trader Joes, Waitrose prices>Whole Foods
      4. **Utilities - these bills are A LOT cheaper in the US**

I can assure, it’s one of the BEST neighborhoods in DC! $2500 is the perfect price for 1BR in the area. Also, yes some of the buildings might appear “old”, but it’s perfectly fine because most of the apartments are clean and refurbished inside with all the modern equipments. It’s not completely modern but that a trade off to live in the best area. Search for a preferably“rent control” building with a good rental management company. DuPont & kalorama neighborhoods are also close to Adams Morgan- the best party scene in dc. Georgetown is also close by.

4521,hkvdv7e,qv8awv,emcee_gee,"I'm the same age as you are. I moved here in August and had the same budget. I do have a car, but I only use it on road trips; not for commuting or other regular activities. I bike and walk a lot and take the Metro when I go in to work. I had visited DC a handful of times over the last decade or so, so I already had a decent idea of the neighborhood vibes.

I chose the U Street area. Not _on_ U Street -- that would be too crazy/loud for me at this point in my life. But close enough that I still get the benefit of all the businesses and nightlife when I want to go out. I chose a condo building that wasn't _super_ new and didn't have all the flashy amenities, but had a relatively strong community of grown adults.

I'd recommend finding a Realtor to help you find a place. They don't generally work with the big property management firms; instead, they help you find individual condos listed by smaller landlords usually with only one or two units (often, places they themselves used to live). I've always been happier renting from individuals than companies; plus, with a Realtor, you get the benefit of having someone who takes the time to get to know you and what you're looking for, rather than having a bunch of 15-minute tours with different listing agents where you've got to ask all the same questions every time and you never really know how honest they're being. Realtors work on commission, generally taking the first month's rent from the landlord, so it doesn't cost you anything.

Also look at West End, Dupont Circle. Navy Yard is nice too but might be a longer walk.

Logan Circle is nice but has a huge rat problem.",1,2021,11,2,1
4535,hkv6l7m,qv8awv,,"Logan Circle or Dupont.  It’s a very easy walk from both to K and 21.  I prefer Logan Circle over Dupont.  

Skip NoMa unless living in a cheap new-ish apartment is important above all else (location, safety, etc.).  I don’t care for Mount Vernon Triangle, but if living in a new-ish building is important then you should consider it.  U Street is ok depending on where you’re talking about specifically, but if you mean actually on  U street it can be loud because there’s a lot of bars.  If you mean on 14th north of U I suggest you walk around at night and decide if you feel safe.  It can be really sketchy at night and during the day, and there’s a surprising amount of crime.  14th below U is totally fine. If you mean Columbia Heights, I’d select your location very carefully.

Skip Foggy Bottom and also West End unless you’re fine living nearly exclusively with college and grad students.  Don’t think you can avoid college students by living in an expensive building.  Both areas are convenient to where you’ll be working but probably not what you’re looking for in terms of a neighborhood.  Also, a lot of West End is office space and pretty deserted on weekends or late at night.",1,2021,11,2,1

4541,hkvsvki,qv8awv,ehenning1537,I love my neighborhood. I’m right next to North Capitol and Rhode Island Avenue sort of in between Shaw and Brookland. I can walk to U street and the Shaw metro station is reasonably close. On nice days I walked to work on K street. I park on the street for free and the neighborhood has a little more of a residential feel. For your budget you can get a nice two bedroom if you want.

4545,hkxn31h,qv8awv,koolaid789,"I would recommend anywhere on 14th St NW spanning Thomas Circle to W St. There’s plenty of newer buildings that would fall into that $2500 per month range - either off of 14th St or in the surrounding cross streets. At 14th and W St, for example, you have the Trader Joe’s two blocks away and a *new* Whole Foods about 4 blocks away. The building on top of that Whole Foods is nice too, I believe it’s called The Wren. It’s also walking distance to your office downtown. Probably at least a 35 minute walk. 

Also would consider navy yard, wouldn’t be walkable per se, but you would be able to hop on metro. Navy yard is awesome and has just about all the same grocery stores and workout studios as are up here in NW :) plus the perk of having the ballpark and being walking distance to the Wharf and Capitol Hill!",1,2021,11,2,1

I walked regularly to GWU and Farragut area, but could also grab the metro easily, with easy access/transfers to all lines.  It was close to Chinatown and Logan circle, but far enough away that it wasn't a big bar scene.

You might also look at the area around 16th and Euclid ... There are a number of apt buildings around there with decent 1BR apts and good amenities. And it's right near a grocery (Harris teeter) and on a good bus route that runs straight down 16th to k street.  It's also close to Adams Morgan, U street, Columbia Heights, and Mt.

DuPont is a bit quiet as a fair few bars unfortunately have gone in the last few years.

Basically all of DC is pretty easily accessible and the row houses and town homes are cute to walk around. You can also easily get to National Airport and Virginia if you ever want.

I work 3 blocks over (Farragut Square area). It's not feasible by walking, but I recommend Alexandria Old Town if bicycling is an option. Has metro access direct to DC, is very, very safe, cute cafes, gorgeous Old Town that reminds me a lot of the U.K. (it was a British colonial city after all), vibrant King Street with lots of restaurants and rowhomes. It's an urban city and feels like an extension of Washington, D.C., but still has that ""Hot Fuzz"" charm. It's the crown jewel of the metro area imo (though I moved out since it was getting DC-levels of expensive).

Honestly, Mount Vernon Triangle, U Street, and Noma are all recently-converted-transitional neighborhoods, so the ""urban frontier"" won't be too far away at any given point. So they may feel sketchy if you turn the wrong corner. Logan Circle is the gay district of D.C. It's a small cute district, but very expensive. Not sure if you swing that way, but if so, it's a great place to be (Dupont Circle is the former LGBT district, but now is for older gays + diplomats - since it abuts Embassy Row).

That being said there are also plenty of new builds or renovations that have gone up in the past few years, but they may be above your budget once you add in utilities and expenses.   Another option for you could be to look to rent from someone who owns a condo, often you get a better price that way.

I avoid Uber like the plague unless a dire situation (and because two drivers pulled up, my teen daughter put her hand on the door handle - I was behind her - and the driver sped off and cancelled the ride. Couldn't even complain.)

I figured out - and might be dissimilar to your situation - that Lyft has this ""priority service"" that is an outright scam. 

* For example, ""Pick up in 5 minutes, $17. Pick up in 10, $14. Pick up in 20, $10."" Except that if I pick 5 minutes, it can still take 15 and they charge me $20. If I pick 10 minutes, it can come in 5 minutes for $15...or in 20 minutes and they charge $15. Or I pick $20 and it comes in 5 minutes and I'm charged $17. There is absolutely no rhyme or reason. To me, this seems like it is against contract law. Can a store say, ""1 pound of tomatos for $5"" then you get to the cash register and it's $10?? No, that's illegal. Advertised price is advertised price. 
* The ride cancelling is RIFE. Sometimes I have had my ride cancelled 2-3 times before a driver actually comes. And I still pay more than advertised!  A couple years ago I missed two planes because of this. I left 2.5 hours before my flight at DCA and twice didn't make it because of the cancelled rides! Zero possibility to complain as there is no ride or driver to link the complaint to.

Another reason I am straight up Empower, Curb or regular taxi now. Empower might take a bit longer, but the drivers keep all fares except like $100 subscription fee a month.

The other thing is that a couple times I treated myself to a ""Luxury"" Lyft driver and they were all the worst, rudest drivers I ever had on Lyft. Who cares what they car was. One was so comical, I felt like I had been kidnapped my Russian mafia. And not like in a funny way.",25,2023,5,2,1

I grew up in a big city in the 90s and remember when homicides were a lot higher than now. It’s not something we should aspire to. And there are clear national trends around policing and enforcement of laws that dictate whether crime rates and murder rates go up and down.

And, no, it’s not dense to study the long term trends around homicides. The graph from 1900 onward is at least worth considering when we try to understand what’s normal or not around homicides. It’s useful to compare to other industrialized countries as well.

>The Connecticut Avenue Multimodal Safety Improvement Project (originally named Connecticut Avenue NW Reversible Lane Safety and Operations Study) was initiated in December 2019. Data analysis, concept development and evaluation, traffic forecasts, and operations analysis were conducted between Spring 2020 and Fall 2020. Between March 2020 and January 2023 approximately 70 stakeholder and agency presentations/events have taken place.

>**During 2021, four Advisory Neighborhood Commissions- ANC 3C, 3E, 3F and 3/4G -and numerous organizations provided resolutions to DDOT requesting that “Concept C” be advanced. On December 15, 2021, Mayor Bowser and DDOT requested the project staff to move forward with Concept C. Concept C includes the removal of the reversible lanes and the addition of one-way protected bicycle lanes on the east and west sides of Connecticut Avenue.** The project also adds other safety improvements, including the addition of left and right turn lanes at intersections, pedestrian refuge islands and curb extensions, intersection realignments, prohibition of Right Turn on Reds, reducing the posted speed limit from 30 mph to 25 mph, and other features.

>On March 19, 2020, the official start of the Covid-19 pandemic, the District Department of Transportation deactivated the operation of the Connecticut Avenue NW peak hour reversible lanes. A decision was subsequently made to permanently remove the peak hour reversible lanes. Removal of the reversible lanes’ signs and markings were completed in the summer 2022. In addition, one of the Concept C recommendations was to reduce the Connecticut Avenue speed limit from 30 mph to 25 mph. This action was also completed in summer 2022.

>**In early 2023, the DDOT leadership has requested that project staff take a fresh look at all of the concepts that were considered, including a reassessment of Concept C. DDOT has received a considerable number of comments during this past year related to the parking removals required to implement Concept C. This reassessment currently is occurring as of August 2023.**

>DDOT has recently reformulated our Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) for the project. This reformulation of the CAC has occurred because the boundaries of the Advisory Neighborhood Commissions and Single-member Districts have changed based on redistricting and the results of the latest decennial census. We expect that the first meeting of this reformulated CAC will occur in fall 2023.

Rosslyn is also a close walk to Georgetown and is on 3 metro lines so you can get into the city or out to the burbs pretty easily. Just nothing going on in Rosslyn-proper",21,2024,11,2,1
514,lzlzwyq,1h2s4bl,rachelella04,"Hey, I lived in rosslyn three years. To preface, I love DC and would live there over Rosslyn if the price and logistics were right for me. Noma might be a better fit for you, but I’ll share my experience in rosslyn at least: 

I loved taking the metro 10 mins or less to Soundcheck for EDM shows, to Metro Center and a short walk to Capitol One arena for bigger concerts or sporting events, or to Warner Theatre and DC improv for comedy shows. Also very convenient for events at the Kennedy Center. Look up the other music venues in DC like The Anthem (at the wharf), 930 club, Atlantis, songbyrd, echostage, flash, capitol one arena, Lincoln theatre, union stage, merriweather post pavilion, etc. Will help you see what the commute would be like to each (the Moovit app is good for public transit estimations).  Songbyrd would be right in your neighborhood in Noma, and Noma has an outdoor free concert series in the summer. Need to take a couple legs to get to several of the venues from rosslyn (eg need to transfer on metro from O/B/S to green line north to get to U st venues of 930 and Atlantis, or to green line south to get to wharf venues of Anthem and Union stage). But honestly when shows get out after 1 AM you’re likely going to have to uber/lyft home to noma or to rosslyn either way for most of these venues since our metro system doesn’t run too late here. I find Ubers/lyfts home to rosslyn decently affordable since by mileage it’s not far from DC proper. If there’s surge pricing, I just e-bike home instead — it’s honestly my fave mode of getting around DC since we have such robust bike lanes.

There’s a small social scene in Rosslyn if you’re looking to grab a beer right after work - there’s a neighborhood bar called Quinn’s that’s always busy.  Open road is also always busy during HH as is continental beer garden in warm months. Salt cocktail bar for something fancier. But as a whole like others have said, don’t expect any nightlife here or extensive restaurant and bar options. You can walk to  Clarendon for more restaurant and bar options, but lots of basic early 20 years old there, I always personally prefer the venture into DC proper for the actual DC cultural experience. So yes, you’ll have more options in noma. 

Re social clubs and sports, will prob have better access in Noma. I have friends on intramural teams that are based in noma, and my bf’s soccer teams are often in the district in navy yard or Shaw. 

Also re social life, I commented on someone else’s post that almost all my friends are in DC because I made an effort to spend time in DC, not Arlington. I have a single friend in Arlington and countless friends in DC. Its certainly helpful when my DC friends live or enjoy hanging out in neighborhoods most convenient for me to get to from rosslyn, such as DuPont circle, Georgetown, west end, foggy bottom, Chinatown, Logan circle. When I’ve had friends up in Columbia heights, petworth, Adams Morgan, or Mount Pleasant it’s more of a PITA by public transit to get to them. Some friends are more willing than others to pick a meeting spot that’s a good middle ground for both parties. And as the other poster said, some people are a bit immature about crossing over the river despite rosslyn being one metro stop (three mins) from the district. Now if they don’t want to take multiple legs of transit to get to someone that’s one thing, but if they live in Capitol Hill and would be open to taking O/B/S lines to foggy bottom, but not rosslyn, that’s just asinine imo. I had a rooftop pool I invited my friends to in the summer, and one of them literally gave me that as her rationale for passing - just tell me you don’t wanna come… But yeah, if you’re trying to date, I could potentially see it being an automatic swipe left when ppl see you’re in Arlington because of those mindsets, so to keep your options open, noma could be better in that sense (although I personally wouldn’t want to date someone so closed-minded lol)

Not sure how much crime matters to you, but noma’s is worse than rosslyn’s for sure. Nothing particularly wrong with that if you have a good head on your shoulders and have tolerance for some grunginess and sketchiness - chance of being assaulted is higher but many prefer neighborhoods with character and more crime over a bland area like rosslyn. The vibes in the two neighborhoods couldn’t be more different - night and day.
 
For me, I fly a lot - so I love that rosslyn gets me metro access to both DCA and IAD easily without transfers.  I value commute to work, airport access, safety, and love walking home from the metro late at night alone. So I accept that rosslyn itself doesn’t have a vibrant social life for me, and that there is an additional hassle of having to take the metro or bike to have access to DC vibes that I love, rather than being able to walk to them (cannot afford to live in DC / I don’t like the neighborhoods that I can afford).

Feel free to dm me if you have any questions and good luck with the move!",9,2024,11,2,1

Then again, I didn't have an issue walking down North Capitol in NW/NE at night last year when I lived in the area or on H street a few years ago. 

As for the bus, I think buses are great! I've never had any major issues and any time someone has gotten out of hand (such as shouting or swearing a lot) the bus driver told the person to knock it off or they would kick them off. 

Or consider getting a bike or Capital Bikeshare membership - I use bikeshare to get from the metro to work (about 1 mile) and it is great!

Three thoughts:

1. Do not get into a set routine - leaving and/or coming home at the same time every day and taking the same exact route every day is a mistake anywhere. I feel very safe where I live (and my fiance is a 6' tall big guy with a beard) but I still make a point to vary my routine one day every week or two - leave 15 minutes earlier, come home slightly later, stop at the grocery store randomly, etc.

2. Consider carrying pepper spray or some other similar option. I used to in college, don't feel the need to anymore. I never needed it but it made me feel safer at the time. It also gave me more confidence and a better ""don't fuck with me"" attitude. Which leads me to ... 

3. If you walk around like you know where you are going and do not want anyone to mess with you most people will leave you alone. If you are staring at your phone (or otherwise distracted), looking around like you are lost, or are just generally unsure then it draws more attention.

Welcome to DC - I love it here, I've rarely have issues beyond someone being obnoxious/rude and a few car break-ins when I've done stupid shit like leave an empty backpack in the back seat.

First, if you have money to spare, help someone in need out. If not, you always have grace to spare. Take ten seconds to look a fellow human being in the eye, tell them you can’t help them right now, and wish them well.  

Second, if you have the time and skill to help someone who is clearly in trouble, do so. If the woman looked shaken up from being called a bitch, it’s ok to ask if she’s ok.

Third, have some empathy for people who are clearly having a tough day/week/month/year. You don’t have to excuse someone’s behavior in order to understand it.

Also, a reason for the move away from this was the rampant corruption of those foot patrol officers who either was paid off to elected to turn a blind eye to a lot of the organized crime in their areas.  

Interestingly enough, our operations in Iraq up to 2007-2008 surge was very much like our police, we'd drive around in our humvees looking for or in many cases waiting for insurgents to engage us while conducting soft/hard knock searches at night. During the surge we conducted more foot patrols, integrated into our local areas in small COPs with local Iraqi police or Iraqi army units and created a much bigger and sustained presence versus daily patrols from our FOB. This marked at first large incidents of fighting because we were not embedded in our AOs but dropped shortly as we denied the insurgents freedom of movement and ability to operate within the local population.

1078,kjewb6w,19el7l2,thebarkingdog,"MPD here.

First answer: We don't have the officers. 

We're so short most Districts are holding over officers from the previous shift nearly every day to make minimum staffing. We weren't defunded, but the freeze in hiring by the council in 2020 will be felt for another decade. And we HAVE to staff the patrol cars first, and we can barely do that. 

Ex. 5 years ago, Adams Morgan and U Street had two units, 40 officers, 20 for each location in addition to regular patrol. That unit is now down to 15 officers for both locations.

Second Answer: Resource allocation. 

Contee made the news when he consolidated and made the all bike patrol unit a few years ago. Except it wasn't made up of new officers but instead, officers he pulled from the Districts. So those Districts lost their officers to other parts of the city.

Third: Practicality. 

Putting someone on a foot beat for 40 hours a week, wears on them. Now factor in weather, call volume, duties, training, etc. And you can see where it can go wrong. Also, for all the criticism of cops simply sitting in their cars, cars provide a safe place to sit, place to store food, gear, paperwork, a computer, and when an emergency comes out, nearby or across the District, officers need cars to get there faster than feet can.",32,2024,1,2,1

It’s not just about quality of policing with residency requirements, it’s about 1) maintaining a tax base and 2) having a police force composed of the people who actually live in the community. 

As your USA Today piece points out, white police officers tend to live in the cities where they worked when those cities were majority-white and white officers were also more likely to reside outside the city than their Black or Latino counterparts.

The piece also includes the argument that residency requirements should be more specific in order to be effective and require officers to live in the neighborhoods where they work. 

I don’t know if any program has included that much specificity or been enforced with any kind of effort beyond a cursory check of a provided address.

Someone was just robbed at gunpoint on the front stoop of my apartment building LAST NIGHT. A terrifying experience, no doubt. However, I give you my cost benefit analysis of why it's still worth it to live in the hood.

Let's say you get mugged, and give them what they want, immediately (which, for the record, you should ALWAYS DO, without question). You'll end up losing your cash, nothing on credit if you call your company soon enough, and probably the fees to get a new license/ID, maybe your Smartrip, etc. Maybe you also lose your nice purse or wallet, but we'll say all of that is worth around $250. The biggest ""cost"" you'll face is the fear of being mugged. Say that is $1000 worth of fear to you (weird concept, but humor me here - this is how cost benefit analysis works). If you move to Near NE, KNOWING that you will get mugged, it becomes something that you're prepared for, and slightly less scared of. The cost of doing business, so to speak. You know it's going to happen, you're not going to get hurt if you hurry up and give the money and don't argue, and you have come to terms with that. And then it becomes a little less scary, and maybe you're only facing $500 of fear. That is now only $750 you're going to lose by being mugged. If it happens once a year (WAY more often than real life), that is a lot less than you're saving on rent by living in the hood. Of course, realizing all this and internalizing it makes the idea even less scary (although guns are still REALLY scary in person) so it's an even better deal.

I've lived around H st for 2 years and never had a problem. I've seen problems, and heard of them, and had them happen to my friends, but it hasn't happened to me yet. I'm prepared for it though, by assuming it WILL eventually happen. If the area gentrifies even more (which it appears to be doing), bonus! In fact, chances are you may never be mugged. But if you do get mugged, you ""knew"" it going in, so it will be manageable.",1,2010,11,2,1

1216,c15xusg,e7axk,awshux,"Agree on the very loose definition of Capitol Hill - I live SE of there, and I would say that while you're fine in general, it might be a good idea to do common sense things, like not brandishing a smart phone (if you have one), having a not-obvious laptop bag (ditto), cuffs over your watch (if it's nice), etc.  Be eyes up, and making friends with neighbors also helps tremendously.",1,2010,11,2,1

1218,c16i2qp,e7axk,drphungky,"Oh, but carry mace if you're a girl - illegal or not. I realized afterwards as a dude I only think about being mugged. Robbery is one thing - rape is something else.

1544,cc9g072,1mhwjr,maker86,"I'm going to assume he has a few issues here.  First, the guy probably isn't using an assault rifle as most people define it.  The distinction has to do with whether the rifle can fire more than one bullet with a pull of the trigger.  It's unlikely that an automatic weapon would be used in a crime as they're fairly expensive and hard to come by.  If this is just a standard AR-15 type weapon, and that's what it sounds like, it would be more appropriately defined as an assault weapon (as opposed to assault rifle), though that term is often also met with hostility as it classes a weapon based more on appearance than functionality.

The other possible issue is that if this were instead an automatic rifle, say an M4 or M16, that fact wouldn't really matter much.  Automatic fire is seldom useful for anything but suppression, which means keeping the enemy under cover while friendlies reposition or evacuate.  It's true that automatic gun fire can kill many people quickly if they're all grouped together and not expecting it, but this situation has evolved past that now.

More useful information would be a whether its a standard rifle or a carbine, the caliber of the rifle, what kind of optics he has, does it look like he's carrying a lot of extra magazines, does he have any sidearms or specialty weapons like a shotgun for breeching, any kind of grenades, what other gear is he wearing, and does he have any kind of communication equipment.  I'm not saying that knowing if the rifle is capable of full auto is not useful information, but it is not as useful as the other information I've noted.  Additionally, the media has proven themselves unreliable in determining weapon types, so there's absolutely no reason to take them seriously in this regard.",5,2013,9,2,1
1545,cc9fyiq,1mhwjr,,"The ""assault"" designator can be useful assuming we know enough about the rifle. It has a specific definition relating to the caliber and action type. If we don't know the caliber or whether it is fully-automatic, ""automatic rifle"" is the preferred nomenclature (automatic can be semi or fully). 

In the case of, say, an M-16 vs. AR-15, the M-16 is an assault rifle whereas the AR-15 is a ""modern sporting rifle"" or simply ""[semi-]automatic rifle"".",2,2013,9,2,1

They bought it in the mid-80s with less than 3% down and the thing has gone up in value over 12x since they bought it and they’ve done relatively minimal improvements since the mid 90s. 

Until the last 5 years, many of their neighbors were 9-5 public sector employees or worked at NGOs or other non-profits. Most but not all were college educated with bachelors degrees but were not lobbyists or “Big Law” lawyers or anything. The woman who lived next door worked at the DC public library and her husband was an HVAC technician before he retired. 

Recently, many longtime residents have retired and sold their houses to the folks many other commenters will assume already owned these houses. Some have been forced to sell because they couldn’t afford the real estate taxes on their dramatically appreciated houses.

While the new buyers today quite wealthy in many west-of-park neighborhoods, this was not always the case. The city was very different back when my parents bought their place in a whole host of ways. The dramatic appreciation in real estate values since the mid-90s, and the post-08 change in the mortgage process, has completely changed the profile of people who can buy here. 

Those younger buyers replacing my childhood neighbors are of course in the stereotypical industries. Those are the only people who can afford to buy those houses at market these days. Many of these folks are transient DC residents and not native Washingtonians who bought way before the housing market became what it is today. There’s no issue with new people moving here, it’s just that those folks are the only ones who can buy at market. 

Tl;dr: lots of the transient folks in those areas are wealthy, many of the long time residents bought in a different era when it was much easier to buy a place to live here. The number LTRs declines every year because by definition they are all old and aging.",70,2021,10,2,1

But still, tell me in what world someone is able to pay for housing and save the  equivalent value of the equity they gain on their home each month.

Yes there are upfront and backend costs to sale. Yes there is tax and insurance and interest costs. But all these exist in commercial real estate as well and are passed on to the renter. 

Also to describe a mortgage as not owning the house until the end of the mortgage is totally inaccurate. If that were the case you wouldn't see a dime selling the house before the mortgage was up. You own the value of the house minus the amount owed to the mortgage lender. 

The premise of your point is still faulty. There is no where I've lived where renting an equivalent property cost less than a mortgage including property tax, interest and insurance.

The problem is not that you still pay for housing when you purchase your home because those costs are explicitly laid out when you buy the house. The problem is indeed that if you invest your down-payment and don't buy a house, you still have to pay the equivalent of a mortgage and all related costs to house yourself. There isn't magic extra money to invest.

I shared a studio with my now husband when I first moved here and we were waiting for his lease to run out. Sharing a space with no walls can be awkward even if you are in a relationship with the person. I can’t imagine sharing one with someone I didn’t know.

Think about things like sleep habits, different levels of cleanliness, etc. When you have a roommate but each have your own bedroom it creates the idea of private vs. shared space. The general consensus among every roommate I’ve ever had is that your bedroom can be as messy as you want but the common space is to be kept clean as a courtesy to your roommates. A studio, even a large one, could create an environment where one of you wants to be awake when the other wants to be asleep, or where one person keeps things very tidy and the other person lets their “bedroom” area king of take over.

This isn’t to say dude is a bad guy—although of course you are correct to be wary of assault, sexual violence, theft, etc when moving in with anyone—but someone’s annoying habits become a lot more annoying when you can’t get away from them. Additionally, it will likely always feel like his space and not your home. What happens if one of you meets and brings them home or someone wants to entertain? 

If you do go for it, I’d definitely take the small dressing room area and put a single bed in there, lock the door and be done with it. That said, it could produce its own challenges, if you’re in the dressing room that means he now needs to get dressed and ready entirely in the bathroom, or else he’s just naked in the common space, which is awkward.

Did you get a chance to talk to him about his lifestyle at all? What hours he’s home, what time he needs to get ready for work, when/if he entertains at home, and the like?",3,2023,10,2,1

One day he said he was moving back to the states and that my roommate and I had, 15 days to vacate. And he could do that because there was no protection for us since we were subletting illegally. I ended up finding an apartment but couldn’t move in until the end of the month which meant moving all my shit to a storage unit and couch surfing for a few weeks then moving into the new place, which was very annoying.

As someone else responded, if the killing happened in the same unit where the repeated fighting happens, this problem may go away on its own, as one person involved may be deceased and the other on their way to jail.

NoMa gets a bad rep because of its past. Before the Harris Teeter, before the dog run, before the Metro was built there, before Tony Williams was mayor, the neighborhood wasn't great. In fact, it was quite shitty. But since those things above have happened the neighborhood have improved quite a bit. For one there are the apartments you're talking about moving into. On the east side of 2nd street there's a neighborhood full of long-term residents who've witnessed the bad and the good and they're happy that things are improving. There's a police sub-station on 2nd between M and Florida, too, with plenty of squad cars driving around throughout the day and night. Don't get me wrong, like any neighborhood east of the park, plenty of crimes are committed in the area. I wouldn't say it's any more or less than anywhere else though people might disagree (""But tummlr, NoMa is near North Capital Street!"" ""Tummlr you fool, NoMa is adjacent to the projects"" ""There are clubs in the area!"" etc.) It's crime, it's random, it happens everywhere, and you can protect yourself by being vigilant and using common sense. Even still, shit happens. Will you have to stay in your apartment when the sun goes down? No, there are no vampires in Northeast.

While economic prosperity tends to decrease violent crime, crime itself can depress community development, perpetuating a cycle of poverty and violence.

According to a 2014 United Nations report, Germany's (high gun ownership) murder rate of 0.8 killings per 100,000 inhabitants was identical to Luxembourg (low gun ownership), where the law prohibits civilian ownership of handguns and gun ownership is rare.

Request an officer to come to your house , and report a threats to do bodily harm (hate crime based on race, and color) provide the offender description to the officer.

The officer will provide you a report number also known as CCN .  The officer will advise you on second sighting.

The way second sighting  works, if you ever come across the offender again. You call 911 provide the call taker the CCN FOR THE THREATS TO DO BODILY HARM, and advise its a second sightin. Provide the  clothing description and the  location of the offender(EX. OUTSIDE LIQUOR STORE, OR STANDING WITH A GROUP OF PEOPLE  NEXT TO A WHITE FORD). 

Officers will respond and arrest him on scene without you having provide details about the crime, since the information will be in the intial report by the  officer who responded to you.

If the officer ask you why you didn't call at the time, advise them that you did call 911, and  you felt the need to report  it since there is a possibility you see him again. Also report that you belief he's capable of committing the threat.",25,2022,1,2,1

Racism?
Oh racism is really bad for the interracial folks. 

Death threats? It would be the everyday occurrence. We actually would bet what would be said or who was going to scream “Cracker” “white boy” or whatever racist term could be thought of.

It was daily life. From this post it’s still life in DC.

People think racism is rampant in the country in the red states.
It is.
But it’s also in our inner cities where white people are targeted for the color of their skin. I know I’ve been targeted many times on M street going home. A man threw firecrackers at me while I was walking and laughed. I’ve had boards thrown at my wheels as I was scootering.

One of the many reasons why we moved from DC.

The prosecutor (Asst AG for race-based incidents!) explained that because of the enhancement, the assailant will be psychologically evaluated and can receive affordable, timely anger management / mental health counseling. She also said that they will be detained until the detention hearing as a public safety concern if you are worried about your assailant threatening people in the area. If there is no outstanding criminal record, you can even ask for diversion, which means the charge will not go on their permanent record and they will instead do stuff like community service.

Never brandish a gun you don’t fully intend on using either, for starters it’s illegal and second it’s just reckless gun handling.

EDIT:  I see the wannabe badasses who have never actually used guns or know best practices are unhappy with this comment lol

These are the same types of people you see on the news who end up shooting their kid or leaving guns lying in the open around for kids to use should any of these people actually get a gun",-2,2022,1,2,1

I don't think there is good data on crime perpetrated by strangers against non-poor people (which I assume the average user of this subreddit to be). 

I am not trying to minimize and say any life is worth more than another. The murder rate is morally abhorrent. But I think what people are really worried about is the risk to themselves, and these overall murder rates are likely not a good indicator of that for a lot of people.  

For me the easy risk comparison is driving on a highway. My gut says that the risk you trade off of not getting randomly murdered in DC is probably around the risk you take on of dying in a car accident if you move to the burbs.

I understand those things; I understand that if you don't go to certain parts of the city, don't engage in crime or gang/crew related activities, and are generally self-aware, you're not likely to be a victim of violent crime in the city.

I'm also not new to this city. I've lived here for 10+ years. I used to rent a garage in an alley in Trinidad and saw some real sketchy shit. I worked for an electric scooter/moped company that sent me to parts of the city that likely very few people on reddit have ever experienced. In all that time, never experienced anything more than package theft and rarely felt unsafe. I'm male if that matters.

However, 3 weeks ago 2 men robbed me at gunpoint 2 blocks from my home, on a street where most of the homes are $1 million+ (no bragging here, I rent). This was at 3pm on a Sunday afternoon, literally in front of people pushing strollers. A week later, my wife was chased down the street by a man who physically tried to grab her. Same neighborhood; same 7 figure homes. Reiterating that I understand statistical probability, and that I'm unlikely to ever experience that again, the random nature of what happened to me is impossible to defend against.

Again, you're incoherent, but if you're trying to say that the drop in DC's prosecution rates was in line with national trends, then you're once again completely wrong. USAO's prosecution rates are abysmal in a comparative sense. [NYC on average declines to prosecute 11% of felonies and 17% of misdemeanors.

Search for DC Crime Cards and look at the map (for some reason the map doesn't work on Chrome, so you'll have to use Edge or Safari). Filter the map to show all violent crime with or without a gun in the last 2 years. It'll give you insight on the neighborhoods that are safest.

Generally speaking from hanging out there, and this could just be a pre versus post covid thing, you know where not to go in Chicago. Around here, I can be coming out of Comet and someone can hop out of a car and just start beating the shit out of someone at the bus stop. Tanner park had a damn drive by. I was in a liquor store- a pretty nice one in northwest- and 3 girls came in and ran away with a whole end cap. Walked into lost gen one time and a dude had been mugged on a run at 3:30 pm (that was the guy who mugged 18 or so people in a stretch of a week). That’s not happening on the lake trail in broad daylight out there, IIRC. There were a series of assaults and a murder at Catholic, I don’t think that’s happening at DePaul (though maybe it is, I dunno). Kids throwing rocks at people on a trail is just normalized here. Maybe it doesn’t percolate up into the news in other cities, but one city I lived in which people think of as much worse than DC one bad kid trying to fight a lady on a trail was in the news for a week, and here it’s just Tuesday. 

I haven’t lived anywhere where a universal piece of advice is “avoid transit when school gets out.”

These are all parts of town where, you know, generally they’re pretty nice- some were not nice not too long ago- but you will either witness some shit, or get there shortly after some shit has happened, and that’s just not very common in other cities in the US and we shouldn’t pretend it is. 

Maybe it’s just post COVID there’s a mean shift down everywhere, and bullshit is more likely to pop off everywhere, I dunno, I suspect that’s true. But people in DC normalize insane things as “city living” and as someone who has lived in medium to large US cities their entire adult life- and in some neighborhoods that still haven’t transitioned- that stuff just isn’t normal.

I still think crime is acceptably pretty rare. And I’m not going to be targeted or have family targeted, so I’m not too too worried. But it’s crazy to me how it pops up everywhere. This is before we get into the “dealing with the bullshit of everyday life” like interacting with city services- which can either go weirdly smoothly, or can… not.

NoMa, Navy Yard, and the Wharf all come to mind of mixed Office-Residential-Retail neighborhoods that, while they might not be 100% thriving post covid, are definitely doing WAY better than downtown. A Chinatown/Downtown that has BOTH that ratio of housing AND a capital one arena with the caps and wizards in it would probably be one of the most in demand neighborhoods in the region.

Creating more housing downtown solves a lot of problems. Creates a local customer base to better support retail, which was super dependent on the officer workers who aren’t coming back no matter how much Bowser whines about it. Busier streets are also less likely to fall into being hotspots for antisocial behavior like drug dealing. And obviously the region desperately needs more housing overall.

The trouble is in convincing the private market that a 95% leased residential building is better than a 60% full office building. Office rents are way higher per square foot.

Every one of the Downtown Zones has a housing requirement except D-7, which covers a couple blocks between the White House and 9th st. So if that’s the area you’re talking about then I guess you’re right but all the other D-XX zones have a housing requirement.

Because property managers typically don’t want to manage more than one kind of tenant, they’ll usually do “swaps” of the required residential and commercial space between properties in the same zone, so while the building itself might not be mixed, the area is. This is something that has to be OKd by the zoning commission (or maybe the zoning administrator? Don’t remember)

That said I do agree there’s not NEARLY enough housing downtown, and the housing ratio requirement for D zones and MU zones should be a lot higher IMO.

2827,kx0rm0r,1bpvvu3,The-20k-Step-Bastard,"It’s adjacency. Urban designers (especially Jane Jacobs who first documented this) assert that neighborhood vibrancy comes from mixed use at all times of day. 

If Chinatown ONLY exists for sports, and only like 100 nights a year, then the remaining 2/3rds of the time is just opportunity for it to spiral. 

You’ve got 395/395 tunnels and giant faceless government buildings to the east, the lawns to the south, and the White House to the west. The only truly healthy thing around it is Mt. Vernon/Logan circle to the north, and people aren’t often walking/biking from their homes in Logan circle to the NGA every day of the week. And L’Enfant station area is the worst example of well-planned urban design, it’s a dour and desolate area of just loading docks in the side of massive office buildings. And right after that? Another highway. And THEN the Wharf. And then the water. 

If Chinatown had the Logan Circle / Mt. Vernon stuff on all four sides of it it would be the best place in the city. But shitty urban design and urban highways constricts it. 

One way to fix this would be to build massive amounts of dense housing in both Chinatown and in the rest of the city. Neighborhood competition doesn’t really happen the way you describe. It’s like the Chum Bucket and the Crusty Crab, or Bob’s Burgers versus Jimmy Pesto. In real life, relationships between businesses and neighborhoods aren’t like that. An adjacent neighborhood improving will directly improve Chinatown, because now there are more people with adjacency who will walk or bike through Chinatown in their daily lives - instead of people in Bethesda taking the red line down to watch a basketball game. 

You want organic, mixed use street life that includes early morning joggers, then construction workers going to their pre-dawn starts, then white collar people going to work, then the people at home taking their toddlers to the parks, then the office people getting lunch, then the students walking home from school, then the office people walking home after work, then the couples getting dinner, then the youngsters meeting for dates, then the party guys hitting the bars, then the high school k’noodlers kissing in the park, then the next day it starts all over again. This requires density in adjacency, better walking/biking access, better safety (more patrols, more lighting), parks, mixed use developments, easily crossable streets, and more.

IMO, You also need a neighborhood to be able to stand on its own as a mixed use place, and not just be a hanger-on. So yeah you can do all those BIG changes to the city’s infrastructure, and they’d be worthy and worthwhile changes, but I do genuinely believe you need to change a lot of the building uses IN downtown and Chinatown as well.

DC is also very generous regarding property taxes to senior citizens and those facing hardship. And they limit how quickly taxes can be raised annually.

I just recently finished serving grand jury duty, and for the two months I served we heard over a hundred cases, and - while it's hard to remember precisely - more than a couple dozen were PCP cases. MPD is constantly doing buy/busts, sending undercovers in, doing patrols and sweeps. I know that they focus their limited resources where problems are the worst, and sometimes their hands are tied on how much they can legally do, but they aren't doing nothing.

I don't know what else to say or what the solution is, but I wouldn't blame MPD as the primary source of the problem.",59,2019,8,2,1

A lot of MPD officers are frustrated too. I was talking to a police officer the other day and he lamented to me that he keeps arresting the same people over and over again. One homeless man who habitually commits sexual assaults [has been arrested over 70 times and has been profiled by the Washington Post because of this.](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/suspect-in-attack-of-pregnant-woman-has-over-70-arrests)

DC has a bail system in which the City does not require people post cash bail. There is [research](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/incomejails.html) that points out that cash bail has a particularly hard hitting effect on racial minorities. Judge Morrison of DC Superior Court is a champion of this cause. He said in an interview with NPR that, [""[In 2017], we released 94 percent of all the people that we arrested without using money. Eighty-eight percent made every single court appearance, and 86 percent were never arrested for any criminal offense of any kind. And of the very small percent of people that were arrested in D.C. that we released, less than 2 percent were rearrested for a crime of violence.""](https://www.npr.org/2018/09/02/644085158/what-changed-after-d-c-ended-cash-bail) The thing I think that is interesting about his quote is that he says that ""less than 2 percent were rearrested for a crime of *violence.*"" In 2016 the Washington Post examined this and came up with the figure that [out of 100 released, 11 are rearrested, and 2 are rearrested for violent crimes,](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/when-it-comes-to-pretrial-release-few-other-jurisdictions-do-it-dcs-way/2016/07/04/8eb52134-e7d3-11e5-b0fd-073d5930a7b7_story.html) which is consistent with his claim, but more complete. That represents a 11% ~~recidivism~~ offense rate overall for those released. The data also may not paint full picture because just because someone commits a crime does not mean that they are going to get caught. It is worth noting that the same article notes that the Metro stabbing that occurred a few years ago involved a perpetrator who was released on bail 2 days prior on a misdemeanor charge. 

DC uses a computer system to calculate whether a person should be re-released or held with regard to bail. It looks at 70 factors and apparently, all things considered, operates on a presumption of release. I'd be interested in seeing what those factors are and if they are enough. It would also be interesting to see how many people are held pretrial in other jurisdictions versus DC's numbers. These incidents are really damaging to DC as a community and if this system is lax, then it needs to be ratcheted up.",48,2019,8,2,1

Yeah, you try it then come back and bitch about MPD giving no fuck's.  This case seems to be unusual in that this wasn't a career violent criminal perp who was on early parole release, probation before judgment, or some other form of justice ""reform"" bullshit where idealism is favored over the facts that early release of violent criminals oftentimes leads to those criminals physically assaulting or even murdering someone else, but we don't like to talk about those who were victims of violent criminals given third/fourth/tenth chances, nah, because there will always be collateral damage that can be justified by the end goal, right?  Nah, we just ignore people who were hurt/killed by idealism and emotional ""rationalizing,"" facts and logic be damned, and obviously the rights of a couple of violent criminals who might actually go on to not be violent again during the early release period is more important than the rights of the public who gets to deal with the violence of those who aren't going to live without being violent.  You want to stem violent crime?  Maybe get real with violent people.  Stop DAs from all these pleas to lesser charges, stop with probation before judgement on its face as the status quo, make this an offer ONLY after the violent criminal has proven they are very likely to not re-offend.

After that I kept my mace on my keychain, and walked with it already in my hand with safety off if I felt I was in an unsafe position.

I don't think people think these things through. Are you really gonna walk around with a loaded gun in your hand? Because if not, for *many* circumstances, you won't have time to grab it and flick the safety off. There are some circumstances where you could have it in your hand and not have enough response time to fire.

Your odds of getting stabbed by a stranger for no reason is infinitesimal.  I'm questioning how helpful your suggestion is.  If someone is close enough to stab you, they're too close to successfully shoot.  If I can stab you, I can also knock the gun out of your hand or stab your hand.

Yes, your counterpoint could be that all civilians go take Krav Maga training, specifically the ones for LEO, but then they don't really offer the LEO training to civilians so we're back to not having the proper training to disarm someone.

- How every neighborhood has a similar, but different vibe. Idk how to explain it but I mainly hang out at the wharf (near where I work), Capitol Hill, Dupont Circle and Shaw neighborhoods and I love them for different reasons.
- There are so many different cuisines to try! 

- The desire to support local businesses is strong.

- Communities are also really strong (i.e. the art community)

- The ability to participate in important, arguably historic protests or other types of moments is available to me at a leisure. For example, I’m able to pop over to the Supreme Court for a protest after work. This is something I really try not to take for granted.

- Cultural events! I am so, so grateful to be able to enjoy events by embassies, the Kennedy Center,  the Museums, etc. — and any other smaller events that bring communities together. 

- The recreation in this city is fantastic. Between what you can do on the Potomac to exploring Rock Creek Park or the arboretum to just hanging out on the National Mall on a nice summer day is perfection.

3315,j67beg4,10n3bb6,thekingoftherodeo,"Four things stand out as things I genuinely love about this area:

(1) DC has an incredible high end dining scene for its size. I'm relatively certain it has the most Michelin stars per capita in the US (if we generously associate the likes of the French Laundry with SF). The starred restaurants are also very varied in their speciality and price point, you can probably get out of Rooster & Owl with a tasting menu & a bottle of wine for ~$130pp all in while you could do Minibar and easily blow $500+ per person.

Even outside of the star circuit, you've got places like Marcel's which are superb.

(2) There are 3 relatively easily accessible airports with almost every major city covered with a direct flight. The competition also keeps a lid on prices, you'll find a flight you can afford even if you have to trek out to BWI (my least favorite of the 3 needless to say!), we aren't hub captive like folks in Charlotte would be to AA for example. 

For bonus points: you absolutely cannot beat a river visual approach into DCA sitting on the DC side on the plane, or indeed taking off to the north. A free sightseeing flight on every departure. Side note that for avgeeks here, Gravelly Point & Udvar-Hazy are fantastic to have accessible.

(3) The weather. Sure it gets hot in July/August, but we have relatively mild weather, mostly no significant disruptive events to worry about (one off derechos aside!) and a tangible 4 seasons, even if we're struggling for some powder this year.

(4) The ability to travel 3ish hours from here and get a completely different experience. NYC. Delaware/MD beaches. Shenandoah. VA vineyards. Snowshoe. Most places are lucky to have one of those things accessible.",43,2023,1,2,1

DC has a bit of Boston and NYC - not nearly as vibrant as NYV but far more so than almost anywhere in the US. Super livable (trees? Grocery stores nearby? Quiet spaces?) DC is a major city yet also it’s not so in your face you can’t meet and know your neighbors.",4,2023,1,2,1

As a southern person who lived in suburban or rural areas most of my life, I find NYC to be a bit too chaotic and impersonal to be appealing. I always wanted to live in a big, but not too big city, and D.C. is the happy middle ground.

There are four seasons but none are too extreme. It's super walkable with robust public transportation networks. You don't need a car, but a car can be helpful. Plus we have three airports and Amtrak to connect you to other cities on the East coast, which makes it a great launchpad for getting elsewhere in the country or around the world.

Much of the shopping, food, culture, sports, arts, activity, and nightlife that can be found in large cities can be found here to some extent. D.C. is expensive but, due to it's regional nature, there is more ""value"" to be found here in terms of trade offs that must be made for the sake of lifestyle vs cost of living.

Personality wise, D.C. is slightly less superficial than places like NYC, LA, and Miami. While people here are still status driven, and elitism and wealth culture still remains very much a part of D.C. social life, people do seem to genuinely value and appreciate intellect and career accomplishment a bit more than beauty and materialism.

3336,jzohdyh,10n3bb6,Euphoric_AlgaeGum,"Ok this is going to be a long one!  First let me speak on the crime:

YES there is crime.  These days certainly your demographic does not matter.  This is very interesting because there was a time when non-marginalized (YT) residents in DC felt they were above it all.  They could be living in a high-end neighborhoods walking there dog happily 2 blocks over from a marginalized (POC) neighborhood at 2:00 am and not worry if there was a shoot-out ensuing.  The knowing (privilege) that you would remain unharmed and protected by law enforcement because of the color the (YT) color of your  skin put these residents in box of safety.  Where crime response by law-enforcement remained biased, violent and unproductive in marginalized neighborhoods.

Today...it DONT MATTER who you are!  The color of your skin DONT MATTER!  You are not above what's going on now!   Most of the crimes are being perpetuated by youth ages 11-17.   Girls...especially are joining these crimes spree's alot more too.  And surprisely the local media are being un-biased finally in whose performing crimes in the city.  Alot of the adult robberies and murders in the DMV area are showing YT faces!  Robberies in stores, domestic violence murders, a drunken fight turned bad.  Finally, the truth, this is not new!  It's just now televised.

A large percentage of these children have been found also to be ""honor roll"" students or ""perfect attendance"" students performing crimes in their school uniforms just seeking a thrill.  Our city has been left scratching their head.  Not all of   
 these children are of marginalized backgrounds.  There is an uprise of fights and violence in the schools.  DC no longer carries the Mayor Barry Summer Youth program and the after-school working programs that was once a component to keep children off these streets and emploring values by means of employment.

This is not the old 90's crime... THIS is the new 2020's crime!

Now, other than that...  
DC is a VIBRANT CITY to live and play in.  Although the cost-of living is high as hell, but the opportunities here matches the lifestyle to afford it.  There is much gentrification taking place here but not without also adding some development value to some once marginalized areas and offering programs of living to these newly re-developed areas.  HOWEVER, it's affecting ELDERLY residents very badly with no resources to re-locate or afford what options they are being giving.  

DC has the sports, kick-ass music venues, museums, the shops, fun-bars, politics, casinos across the ways, clubs, parks, great family fun and just a wonderful diverse culture!  Marijuana can now be consumed publicly too-lol.  There is SO MUCH here.  

 We are the creators, heartbeat and home of GO-GO music! But that's another tread! lol.  New incoming residents tried to silence GO-GO music being played at city events and street corners...but that went badly!  DC Native's here that grew up on the music or are a part of the new and old bands will not be muted so they held a rally!  Another DC win!

Would i recommend moving here or visiting here from wherever you are coming from?...ABSOLUTELY!  The best knowledge is from the experience itself!  Please feel free to ask me any questions you'd like to know?  I've been here for 40 years, yes i've moved a few times before but DC keeps calling me back!",3,2023,9,2,1

Unfortunately lots of it, especially the wealthiest/nicest neighborhoods, are not very Metro-accessible or walkable. Neighborhoods on the Orange or Blue Lines would have the most Metro-accessible routes to Arlington for work. Along the Orange Line, Cheverly and New Carollton are nice areas, Cheverly in particular is very popular with young families wanting to live close to DC. It is unfortunately not walkable to much aside from the Metro station and the local parks. Maybe someone else can chime in with ideas on the Blue Line. 

Other communities in PG County on the Route 1 Corridor (Mount Rainier, Hyattsville, College Park/University Park) are diverse, welcoming and more walkable to businesses and restaurants. Many of them are walkable to the Green Line or MARC but that would be a complicated and long commute to Arlington.

This new neighborhood seems like 4/10 White, 4/10 Black, 2/10 other.  As an Asian-American, I'm pretty happy with this.  That neighborhood I used to live in actually was like 9/10 White in the 80s-90s but that gradually those White people moved into rural areas because of scary minorities (I know this personally because one of my best childhood friends moved down to the Eastern Shore.  His parents were cool but unfortunately they were pretty racist, even if they were always kind to me, a shy Asian kid).  

Welcome to NOVA I guess, we're a Northern city right on the edge of the South, so we get a good mix of people.  I used to really think the mix of Conservative and Liberals was a good thing but holy hell, the last 5 or so years makes me feel very differently about that.

3526,gr75j0v,m6nlgp,djk29a_,"FWIW, the reality to buy a house is things kinda suck until you can save up 20% down (kinda hard when I lost all my down payment in the last recession) and the NOVA real estate market is so inventory limited buyers are getting outbid on terrible junk 1950s houses with $800k+ in cash and offering zero contingencies so essentially you need ~$1MM in liquidity to comfortably buy a house here. Otherwise there’s a smattering of condos and townhouses with HOAs that are also quite expensive once total costs are factored in.

Instead, I bought in PWC a couple years ago, suck up the commute, and am saving money faster for our next house than if I rented or ate rice and beans for 6 years. In fact, probably never going to buy within the beltway. I lose out on the ridiculous appreciation there, but after I lost all money before with a house I’m not risking doing that crap again.",9,2021,3,2,1

Your commute would be fairly easy too since you can hop on the 395 if driving and cross the bridge quickly to Arlington, or take the metro. Some of the other neighborhoods I have seen recommended here are going to have much longer commutes. The easy access to the 395 from NOMA/Eckington can’t be overstated.

If it's any consolation:

* Re: safety - the vast majority of people who rob houses don't come back. Although of course your sense of security is shattered, many times these kinds of burglaries are almost professional. They come in, know exactly what they're looking for and leave the place trashed.
* Do you know what they took? Our burglars were focused on guns, jewelry and handbags. They could have totally taken our cars and we saw they opened the drawer with the keys in them, but the cars were untouched and all technology were untouched (didn't steal TVs - an ipad was laying on the coffee table and it was untouched.) Makes us feel a little better that they weren't going to come back and were definitely professional.
   * They even could tell the difference between the real and fake diamonds.
   * They were not interested in any identity theft type things
   * They stole small safes (pro-tip: put airtags in smaller safes that can be transported bc even if they can't access them immediately, they can take them and crack them later)
   * Knowing what they took can help sus out motives and likelihood that they'd be back
* Call the police. Although there's probably not a lot they can do, they can alert local pawn shops. They also brought in a person to sweep for prints (although they didn't find anything.) They also got a guy to come at 2am to board up our massive window that was shattered. Also they were helpful in reassuring us that most likely in our case 1) they wouldn't come back and 2) they were not looking for ID theft stuff and just wanted the guns and jewelry to sell. You will also need a police report for insurance. The cops in our case were also just super nice and understanding and gave us more info on the likely profile of the perpetrators.

For Prevention:

* alarm systems are great, even in apartment buildings. we were dumb and left ours off in a false sense of security so there was a week long window where this could have happened to us and we had no idea
* keep all receipts and list the value of any valuable items you have and would want to get insurance payouts from.
* Take pictures of jewelry/items if you have a lot of them so if it's taken you know. Sometimes you may forget what exactly was stolen
* Airtags in small safes, and understand that small safes are not a deterrent in these situations
* Be wary of who you notify when you're going out of town. People can definitely stalk but pretty much 95% of burglaries I've heard of happens when people are out of town.",18,2023,6,2,1

- have someone stay at your house if you plan on being away for more than couple days;
- install cameras 
- have a security alarm system (most connect to the police)
- avoid advertising your whereabouts - people may use this to know when to strike . Btw, not suggesting that you do

Plus they depreciate goods so like one of my handbags that I just got a month prior they were going to reimburse only like 75% so even with insurance you still have to prove a lot of stuff and that can be hard if you can't remember everything that was taken or have paper trails for everything.

We did have the serial numbers to the guns and reported them to the police so if a crime was committed with those guns they were listed as stolen.

The sucky thing was that passports were in the small safe they took, and honestly if they knew it was passports they probably wouldn't have taken it (based on what they did and didn't steal). But that was a NIGHTMARE because we were traveling internationally soon and the rush passport thing is a total shitshow right now.

We go up and stand to the side to take pictures. And suddenly my dad and his best friend coming running and are like “uh we gotta go”. They had tried to crash the wedding bar! These two boomers in their kahkis and sports coats tried to blend in at a black tie wedding. The bartender was like “name the bride and groom” and they were like “touché” 

So we go downstairs and get ready to call a million cabs bc it’s 2012 and Uber doesn’t exist. And my dad’s friend comes over and says “I got us a ride” and we go, “all of us?” And he goes “yea” 

Well, he had talked to the wedding limo and said “I’ll pay you $100 in cash if you drive us to our hotel and we promise not to touch anything” and the driver said “deal, the bride and groom don’t leave for another 2 hours”. So we took the limo back to the hotel.

You’d have to drive out about 2-3 hours to get to Delaware or Virginia Beach and even then it’s a totally different vibe. Tons of nice parks and forests in the DMV, though. Just look on maps for green, just outside the city; most of the time it’s a public park. 

There is not a lot of independent movie theaters like in SF, the two to four screen theaters that pepper the Richmond District, not really a thing in DC. But the museums are great and there is a lot of culture here, it’s just a different vibe—not necessarily better or worse, just different. I ended up settling down here, but still miss the west coast.

Oh and the drivers are much worse here than they are in the Bay Area but the traffic is not quite as bad. Public transportation is a million times better in DC, too. Rent is just as high in the Capitol Hill area as it is in SF.

Lots of great restaurants in the city proper but once you get to the suburbs it can drop off pretty quick. Bombay Street Food has the best Indian food, Rasika a close second. Good Mexican food is a bit harder to find, compared to SF; I love Surfside and El Bebe in SW/SE, close to Capitol Hill, but only discovered them the last year before moving to Silver Spring. Sanphan for Thai food in Capital Hill. Good Italian is oddly enough really hard to find. Il Radicchio in Arlington, VA is great, my favorite, but a bit of a drive or train ride from DC. 

Pizza doesn’t compare to San Francisco. There are great pizza places here but it’s a different style altogether. Not a lot of that sloppy molten-cheese-and-sauce SF pizza that I sometimes feel like I would kill for. I adjusted after a year or two, to the restaurants here and am of the opinion that there is quite a lot of great restaurants here.",8,2024,11,2,1

All three of those areas are pretty residential. So not too loud or crowded. Lincoln Park has the park lots of people like to walk or run around. I don't quite know what you mean by vibrant, but I like the Eastern Market farmers Market. And Eastern Market has lots of bars and restaurants, as does Barracks Row, and as I said before, all three neighborhoods are not that far from H Street which apparently you considered as meeting your requirements.

Keep in mind that, traditionally, law school classes are taught using the ""socratic method,"" which involves calling on people randomly (not waiting for a raise of hands), and then basically humiliating people who cannot answer the question correctly.  So, rough treatment is par for the course in law school.  
However, while law school professors may ridicule an unprepared student for being unprepared, they do not attack the person per se, so they don't regress to calling attention to the physical characteristics of the student.  
So, even in the context of a law school class, I think it is a mistake to call on people based on their physical characteristics (of the person themselves, not their clothes), but I suppose there is no bright line.  I think your examples of ""Mr. Black Person"" and ""Mr. Latino"" would be unacceptable, along with ""Mr. Gay Man,"" ""Ms. Short Lady,"" ""Mr. Missing Front Tooth,"" etc.  Referring to an article of clothing seems safe, ""Mr. Blue Shirt,"" ""Ms. Kate Spade Handbag.""",2,2022,2,2,1

It is widely recognized in the US as a slur because it was almost always used in a racist way. Obviously, this is US centric context, and I don’t expect a Swiss man to know it. I do expect a full fledged law professor to know better and be deliberate with his words, and to know that referring to people by their ethnic background is uncomfortable in the best of times.

Woodley/Cleveland Park are both metro accessible, but Glover Park/Cathedral Heights would require a longer walk and/or buses to get around. 

As for price, you're more likely to see studios in your price range in older buildings, but on the plus side they're likely to be rent controlled so your rent won't skyrocket after the first year. Some of the buildings in these areas tend to advertise vacant units with signs outside the building instead of a website, so it can be helpful to actually explore the area in person to see possibilities.",15,2024,4,2,1

You might not see the statistics (crime stats get juked) but my friends/neighbors see it all the time.

And please don't tell me it's not as bad as the 90s.  Even in this article, which sounded like a bullshit lede, there are facts:

\-32 percent increase in homicides from 2022

\-Property crime in D.C., however, has increased by 32 percent since last year — with a 109 percent increase in car thefts.

\- 2 in 3 D.C. residents (66 percent) are “very concerned” about gun violence in the area

\-Half (48 percent) say \[Very concerned\] about carjackings.

And that's whats reported. There's a lot that doesn't get reported because everybody wants things to look better.

&#x200B;

How the fuck do you not believe this? On Sunday, I saw young kids that I can only guess stole a stationary car or car jacked somebody  and they were going on a sweet ride with DC MPD police behind them (honestly, they shouldn't try to ram that car full of what looked like 10-14 year olds IMO).

Also heard semi-automatic fire three days ago and DC MPD basically said to my ANC that it sounded like semi-automatic fire but will never put that in a police report.

We had a shootout in the hallway. For months we’d been complaining about the stairwell being propped and random people coming and going but they ignored us. 

The story as relayed to me by a neighbor, while we were sitting on the street waiting for the police to finish clearing our floor and collecting evidence:

A local pharmaceutical retailer had his girlfriend rent a unit in the building which he then decked out with food, drinks, tvs and other amenities for his employees. They also lined the walk-in closet with multiple layers of plywood and replaced the closet door so that it could be used to securely store inventory and other supplies. To facilitate easy access to colleagues without keys or fobs they propped the doors and often also left the unit’s door slightly ajar. 

One evening, several employees were enjoying a family meal in the unit. Another employee came from the metro station to deliver inventory and collect the nightly deposit. Unarmed wholesale purchasers followed him up and, temporarily lacking funds, suggested that they take delivery of the just-delivered pharmaceuticals and cash. I’m sure they promised to send over a wire transfer just as soon as their AP department processed the correct forms. 

The delivery guy pulled out a firearm which he then promptly dropped. One of the wholesale purchasers picked up the weapon and promptly shot its owner in the ass for the discourteous behavior. The remainder of the staff then reached for whatever weapons they could find and rushed to empty them in the general direction of the fleeing wholesale buyers. 

The hallway was drenched in blood from the assless guy, who apparently was the only person hit. 

Bozzuto sent a note the next morning that “We were notified of a reported altercation that resulted in one male guest being shot at the property. We are certain you share our concern for this most unfortunate situation. We encourage you to call the police if you have any information related to this incident.” Management skipped the scheduled meeting the next day.",37,2023,9,2,1

My car was broken into (as has every single other car in my building). The ONLY place they do not have cameras is the resident portion of the garage, which I imagine is by design for one reason or another. When I inquired about the cameras, mgmt told me they feel cameras don't do anything to deter crime, and it would be pointless to have them after the car had already been broken into. What? Besides not making a lick of sense, I guess they've never heard of evidence. 

We've also had an issue with folks sleeping, shooting dope, smoking weed, etc. in the stairwells. The lock was broken on most of the stairway doors, but it took forever to be addressed (if it ever was). That, I don't mind as much as the other shit going on, but I do understand how this is a viable safety issue. Also, the fact that mgmt doesn't care, doesn't address it, and looks for new ways to squeeze money from everyone speaks volumes.

I saw someone attempt to steal a running car right in front of Trader Joe's the other night. This was at 8PM ish, when a lot of people were walkinga round and dining a few feet away. Car pulled up, ski mask guy hopped out and hopped in idling car, owner grabbed him, ski mask guy hopped in getaway car, and they blasted through a red light at 4th and Fla. This could have gone downhill fast had a firearm come into the equation.

If you look at MPD reports, there have been a lot of carjackings and armed robberies right around Union Market (and NoMa). Of course, none of the buildings will ever give residents a heads up. They just don't give a fuck. All they care about is jacking up rent and ignoring resident requests.

I’d be shocked if it wasn’t communicated up the chain at least somewhat.


Like what if those residents came back armed for those dogs or for their belongings? What if something happened with the 25 armed policemen in my not so very large hallway? 
What if those residents were in the unit when the policemen were there and there was a shootout?

As someone who was here in that time period, I think that the sub doesn't get posts from the majority of us who were here then, who don't share that attitude, because we correctly identify that it's irrelevant and unhelpful to point that out. 

But seeing comments like ""the people doing drugs on the stairwell don’t bother me generally since they keep to themselves"" makes me think, why the fuck does it not bother you? Get fucking bothered. 

And while your building management may respond to incidents well, or not well, they are not the root cause of these issues, and complaining to them is not going to make any issues from the surroundings go away. If your building management was perfect, the most they could do is keep it just beyond the property line. It's an error to think they are the cause or the solution. 

These are large, cyclical problems that resist quick solutions. You feel unsafe because you are unsafe. It didn't happen overnight and it's not going to go away overnight.

This is such a tired (and frankly stupid) copout. For two reasons:  
-If everyone in DC acted like I do (not rape people, not assault people, not kill people) it would be literally *perfectly* safe. It's insane to blame me for a crime wave.    

-Government exists for a reason, and the very initial reason for the founding of government was to protect citizens from violence. They're barely trying. We (with or without consent) have given them a legal monopoly on violence to do so on our behalf to keep the weak, vulnerable and helpless safe. Now that we've given them money, authority, weaponry, and a mandate you're telling me that DC is violent because the people I pay and authorize to protect it are only really window dressing. And that me and my fellow citizens need to be 'more engaged' in the community?  
Bull shit. If I'm going to be responsible then DC needs to send me back my taxes, close the schools, fire all the teachers and cops and pull down the government buildings. Either they take the lead and accept responsibility for their (many) failures or they stop this fucking playing both sides. Are they on the job or is 'the community' supposed to pull all the weight?

>every single system and person that individual came into contact with failed them.  


What a joke. You're saying that the people committing murder on a daily basis in DC aren't responsible for their actions. But I am responsible for their actions. I ""failed"" the murderers and rapists of DC. This perverse inversion game might fool some white liberal savior types in DC but it doesn't work on anyone with 2 brain cells to rub together.

Nearly everyone released in DC is also released to parole or probation supervision, and part of that agency’s job is to assist with reentry. 

And I also think you’re overestimating the number of people whose families totally abandon them during incarceration. You can find videos online of people overjoyed to be reunited with loved ones they haven’t seen in decades—parents, children, cousins, friends, neighbors—many of whom have been keeping a room for the person to live in after release, no matter how long it’s been.

See, I've identified your problem.  

The common problem among progressives is that they choose to theorize and attempt to break new ground rather than looking at what.. ya know.. actually *works*. As an example: DCPS is the most expensive per-student school system in the nation. It's also one of the worst. So what do all progressives in DC suggest we do? More of the same. More money! Because when they *think about it* more money should help. They've simulated it in their powerful brains, and they know the outcome. Sure, in 3 generations their super smart kids will still be fighting the same battles, but at least they won't have to admit failure, right? It's like the military industrial complex on steroids, seeing as how we spend *vastly* more on education and social programs than we do on war.  

I see you refused to answer why DC and a few other deep blue cities are the ones experiencing crime waves while all the yokels in those backwards red states are spending less, imprisoning less, policing less and still getting vastly better outcomes. But to the progressive Washingtonian, trying something new that might work, but that also might need to use someone else's old school idea is abhorrent. ""Always forward! Always progress! Always failure as well, but hey! At least we're moving *forward* and trying new things! Sure, we've thrown hundreds of people into the thresher of homicide and rape in the intervening decades, but what's a couple of eggs right to an always-in-progress and never quite ready for prime time omelet right?""

Slightly less than 15 percent are incarcerated for drug crimes, even though most Americans* [*believe*](https://www.vox.com/2016/9/7/12814504/mass-incarceration-poll) *the figure to be about 50 percent. (Drugs play a bigger role in the federal prison system, but that holds only about 10 percent of all prisoners; most incarcerated people are in state prison.)*

*The share of those in state prison for committing violence is even greater than 55 percent, however. Prisoners are classified by the most serious offense for which they are convicted, not arrested or charged. So if someone is arrested for a violent crime but ends up pleading guilty to a drug charge, his crime is classified as a nonviolent drug offense, even if the underlying incident — like a domestic violence case in which the victim won’t testify — is the reason the prosecutor sought prison time.*",3,2020,11,2,1

Oh yeah? I just picked three of the most rural states off the top of my head.

DC's was 166.
**Forcible rape:**

DC: 345
**All violent crime:**

>The opioid crisis has been raging for years in red states.  

Again, not at all true. Opioids are killing far more people in the NE and rust belt states than 'red' states. The top ten includes Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Hampshire, and Delaware. Not very red, eh?  

>We’re repairing and building everything you all broke or didn’t care to think about.  
You're repairing things? And during this repair we get an extra hundred deaths over the last two years? Who broke what? It's been deep blue control of DC for almost a century now. DC brags about how it's the most progressive city and the voting patterns back that up. Just because progs can't get shit done given 80 years doesn't mean you'll be able to given another lost generation.

4695,gdkpu6a,k03gu6,dcmcg,"I don't think that's true either. For example, [even if you discount all drug offenders in state and federal prisons we still have the highest incarceration rate in the world](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/releasing-drug-offenders-wont-end-mass-incarceration/), and one that is significantly higher than all our western counterparts. Also [here](https://washingtonmonthly.com/2013/08/01/non-violent-offenders-have-been-a-declining-part-of-prison-populations-for-20-years/): ""The proportion of the U.S. population that is serving time for violent crimes is larger than the proportion of the Western European population that is serving time for all offenses combined.""

We seem to have such a high incarceration rate for two reasons: 1) we have more people committing serious crimes than other countries and 2) we have more significant penalties for those crimes.

4698,gdhhk1f,k03gu6,rasputin777,">I guess it just fundamentally comes down to I want to at least try to help everyone and hold ourselves to a higher standard then locking people away and destroying more lives.  

100%! I do too!  

I'm not at all against CJR in any way, shape, or form. My bone with the council is that they're spending a lot more time on easing life for 'returning citizens' than they are for the people those same citizens have assaulted, raped and murdered.  

It's not like DC has victims well taken care of. Like I mentioned earlier, I live in a neighborhood that has very recently become rough once again. Rapes, carjacked delivery drivers, etc. I am friends/family with several assault victims. Once the police take their report, they roll out and that's it. One of the victims got a card for a counselor to call. The number went to busy each time it was tried. After spending some time researching it, the victim discovered that DC claims that victims of violent crimes can get their medical bills paid. (in this case a fractured eye socket and broken rib). Guess what? 2 years later and DC is fighting to not pay. And this is a story that I've heard a hundred times.  

So what's the council doing? Passing a bill of rights for victim's of violent crime? Nope! They're trying to reduce sentencing for the small number of people that actually end up serving time. It's fucking ludicrous.  

And in any case, I don't see how any prog can handwave away the awful stats we have. (not that you are). Most of the victims of homicide are black. Most of the victims of rape are women. The crime wave isn't hurting wealthy white men. It's hurting minorities, and when anyone objects to the city's awful leadership everyone pretends they're some gentrifying force and just need to 'deal with' the crime as part of living in a city. Hell, I've had conversations where people are *proud* of the violence around them, like it makes them a badass to have their neighbors raped.  

But yes, I think we're on the same team. I want justice for everyone. But we should prioritize victims over offenders.",3,2020,11,2,1

Sadly, all cities have areas that are higher crime vs others, that's why looking at stats for the whole city is informative but can lead you to draw wrong conclusion (ie whole city is violent, vs pockets of violence).

As for comparing a city to a suburb, well sure, you are more likely to be a victim of crime in DC than in a suburb. But that is an odd comparison since more people usually leads to more crime, all else being equal. Someone who is used to rural living might find your sleepy suburb a hot bed of vice and violence.

Finally, it's funny how we normalize certain violence while emphasizing other violence. For example, you are far far more likely to die in a vehicle crash than you are to die being shot during a violent event. In fact, American roads have become far deadlier in the past few years.

4920,h9vl4o4,p90h2e,ncblake,"Nearly 7 year Columbia Heights resident here: This comment section is pretty misleading and one-sided. 

The thing to know is that Columbia Heights is the most dense and most diverse neighborhood in the city. There are young professionals, young families, born-and-raised Black residents, a large Hispanic community, and everything else you can imagine. It’s one of the busier and louder neighborhoods. It has the most convenient transit access in the city. There are Michelin restaurants just blocks away from public housing. You’ll see homelessness and addiction, as well as privilege and luxury living. It’s all here. 

If you’ve lived in a “big city” of any kind, there won’t be much you haven’t seen before. Columbia Heights does rank fairly high in terms of crime data, but it’s largely highly localized violence between individuals who are known to one another. If you’re minding your own business and generally cognizant of your surroundings, it isn’t much more dangerous than any other neighborhood aside from the absolute wealthiest places in the city. 

I’ve always felt that there’s “safety in numbers” in Columbia Heights. Yes, there’s always the risk of being a bystander, but crimes like stick-ups, robberies, etc that target DC’s “professional” crowd tend to be more prevalent in neighborhoods with less foot traffic, in my experience. 

I will say that I don’t think you’ve picked the best blocks in the neighborhood. Neither is “bad” per-se, but you’ll have to cross some of the more infamous blocks to get from those two places to somewhere like the Metro or grocery store. 13th and Clifton, in particular, I wouldn’t recommend for this reason. Further north and closer to 16th St/Mt Pleasant would be safer bets.

I’m a quiet neighborhood side street with those 1m condos next to long time families. 

I deal with survival sex workers, assault, ODs, the never ending rats the size of small children (hyperbole) and just general jackassness—on the “quiet” street, mind you.

In ten years, my friend (M, Latinx) has been beaten 3 times, robbed once on the corner walking home, bad had his place broken into. 

CH in the past 10 years has *not* gotten better. COVID has really hurt people, but **there were cracks before that thanks to the general buttholeness of the previous admin**. And, compared to northern cities (yeah I lived in West Philly in the 80s, too), there’s a LOT going on, a LOT to navigate. 

We were walking by Coffey before lockdown and a young female (like OPprobably) had her iPhone on the table. Two young kids ran in and grabbed it and were off... These small daily crimes aren’t elevated. 

You can’t even buy toothpaste at CVS without the security guard unlocking the Crest. People are doing whatever they can do to survive like stealing toothpaste.  

Reddit —on the other hand—is talking about Michelin restaurants in the neighborhood and the same weird armed assault repost.

“Crime” (and bundling other issues I correctly under that label) happens when people have either no other options or they suck as humans. I’d like to think that most humans don’t suck by choice. 

I know who the survival sex workers are because I see them every day. There is no one on this sub who can say, “hey! She wanted this lifestyle choice!”

I know that “crime” (drug use, B/E, assault) migrates when given the opportunity because I see it at the end of my street off 14th now because the business closed.

The cops are 24/7 on Spring and 14th. They randomly patrol. 
*They know* who and what is happening because they see the same people every day, too. 

Does crime happen because criminals are assholes? Does that mean that there are the most ever assholes in CH?

Naw... crime happens because people don’t have other options.

DC is not a simple solution. I don’t pretend to have any sort of answer and try not to contribute more to the problem anymore than I do by being a white yankee transplant to DC.

Every black man is not a thug after all. How do I know? Because I am one of them and certainly do not identify with that lifestyle at all.

Despite Columbia Heights appearing to be melting pot of cultures upon closure look it simply is not the case.  There seems to be a lack of interest in the new white residents in getting to know their new neighborhood and the people who have been there for years.  This air of aloofness is really annoying to me and the insistence on making an area appeal to them rather than integrating into the fabric of the neighborhood is something I call ""the Columbus Effect"" 

Why do I call it that? Well I already answered that in part above.  

Is it wrong to want to live somewhere that you don't have to worry about someone constantly begging you for money? No, not at all.  Is it wrong to not want to live around an open air drug market?  Of course not.

But here's the thing....If people took the time to learn about the neighborhood they intend to move into, then they would already know whether or not that is the neighborhood for them.  As mentioned, it may be that one part of the neighborhood is concerning but another part isn't and that's cool but you won't know if you don't invest a measure of time to understand the people that are already there.

I can speak on this because I have been there and done that.  I took the time to learn and take in the sights at different times and was able to move somewhere that has brought me a lot of happiness instead of misery. I've lived in places where random people would be sitting on the steps and would be in the way when you are trying to enter or leave the apartment building.  

I hate that.

I don't want to be around an area known for drug activity because that brings with it a measure of violence and drama that I want nothing to do with.  

I lived in the Trinidad neighborhood back in the mid 90's and thank goodness I didn't know that many nights what I was hearing was gunshots. I had moved there from NW just to the west of Columbia Heights and so it was definitely a different area than what I was used to.

The fact that an area can change quickly I can attest to because there was a riot in Mt Pleasant back in the early 90's that I didn't find out about until I was an adult even though I was close by.  

Best believe that when I was looking for an apartment I wanted something different. Somewhere I would feel comfortable for my friends and family to be able to walk down the street without being concerned about their safety. 

I get that.
