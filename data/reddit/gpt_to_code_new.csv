Also no such agreement.  You might be thinking of the vehicle exception to the warrant requirement under case law.  PC is still needed.

The case law that decided this was US v. Antoine Jones and was based on a D.C. case.  The takeaway from that case is that warrants are required to attach a GPS to a suspect vehicle.  There are issues that were unanswered with the case but that’s how I interpret it and I’m sure how the US Attorney/OAG would too.

I agree with you about the chaos aspect. I don't think they would get as much joy from this if there wasn't the potential danger of getting arrested or intimidating/interrupting other people.

Unfortunately, after all the articles/posts I've read about this issue, I actually do not think that people smarter than us, lawmakers or otherwise, have actually tried to do anything about this. That's what I'm particularly incensed about.

Regarding the traffic cameras, it's the only way that MPD can track down the offenders because of the no chase policy. From what I've read, around 50%+ of these off road vehicles are actually stolen, so it's the only way they can enforce the law. The act of riding illegally in DC streets is a misdemeanor and carries up to a $250 fine (but no one's ever been fined that much), and if they can't pay the $50-$150 that they're typically fined, then it comes with up to a 12 day stint in DC jail, which is again waived because it's a misdemeanor and DC Jails are way overstuffed.

So, if we had the cameras, at minimum we can hope to confiscate illegal/stolen off-roading vehicles.

Some activists try to interlink these two things, but the sad truth is even if all the guns were rounded up and destroyed, these gang wars and “beefs” between young people would then involve knives, machetes, etc. (they already do to some extent.). 

Gun control will make it a bit harder for criminals to get a gun, and would bring harsher mandatory sentences upon those who use guns for violent crimes.

2185,ie27b79,vmknzh,,"The point of movements like ""defund the police"" is not to eliminate those resources, but to redirect those funds into social programs that are shown to help reduce crime, such as  social services, youth services, housing, education, healthcare, etc.  For example, if a cop performs a welfare check instead of a social worker, there's a much greater risk of that check turning into a violent altercation.  Or if someone tries to pass a counterfeit $50 bill, a cop being called means they might be shot when the situation escalates.  As a society, we often default to police-based policies, but there are many other options that could help address people's issues without introducing a cop that often defaults to escalation and violence.  

""Defund the Police"" refers to a number of specific policy proposals that are based on the finding--that you seem to readily agree with--that merely increasing the budget of police is *not* shown to [reduce crime](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/06/07/over-past-60-years-more-spending-police-hasnt-necessarily-meant-less-crime/).

No one was aware of this and several minutes later, the bus stops on the side and two police offers walk in pointing out random men to stand outside.

I grew up here and we had team scavenger hunts around the city/surrounding areas in high school. “Take a group photo with a stranger but don’t tell them why” is a pretty standard task for activities like that alongside more involved tasks like “go to the mall and ask around until you find someone named Paul and then take a picture with him and his ID as proof”, “get a stranger to give you $5”, or  “acquire 10 lbs of butter, make a sculpture, and send a picture to the scavenger hunt master.”

I’ve also done similar activities organized by hostels etc while traveling (for example, a combination bar crawl and scavenger hunt) and I’ve seen bachelorette parties do them as well, but I’m going to assume neither of these options are correct given the people who approached your friend were sober.

I was walking in Long Bridge Park this past June; earbuds in, I'm listening to some random Crime Junkies episode. Two young white men approach me and I immediately clue in to the fact that they're Mormons. 

One of them gestures towards me, and says something to me. I can't quite make out what he's saying over Ashley Flowers in my ear, so I respond with a ""huh?"" while pulling out my earbud.

The other then says something in semi-fluent Chinese, not sure what but it was at least 2-3 sentences of dialogue. Context: I'm Asian, but not Chinese. And I don't speak Chinese either. But I was raised in the South, and I've got a slight Southern accent in English.

I'm befuddled at this point, and I say back, ""Sorry pal, I don't speak Chinese. Good luck finding someone who does.""

2544,hkvf6du,qv8awv,newredditryyy,"My attempt at comparing neighborhoods in London to DC:

— Dupont/Kalorama ≈ Kensington/Notting Hill. With upscale row houses and home to most of the embassies, this is a relatively peaceful/upscale area. Tons of restaurants, bars, shops, and a weekly farmers market kinda gives DuPont a notting hill vibe.

— Adams Morgan (AdMo) ≈ Camden. AdMo is pretty hipster/offbeat for DC standards (though not at the level of Takoma Park), with its main stretch on 18th street featuring a wide mix of shops, restaurants, and nightlife. 

— U Street/Shaw ≈ Shoredtich. Lots of bars. Like AdMo, this is a top destination for young people to go out on weekends. Good place for live music as well with several of DC’s top venues (9:30 club, Lincoln Theater).

— Georgetown ≈ Knightsbridge. Very posh, known for the University and it being DC’s shopping hub. With its variety of stores, also reminiscent of SoHo.

— NoMa/H Street Cordidor ≈ Brixton. An interesting mix of grit with new developments. Street art and interesting restaurants give the area a creative energy. Also home to Union Market (the closest thing DC has to Borough/Camden). 

— Navy Yard ≈ Canary Wharf. Brand new and a little ways out, feels very different from the rest of DC. Surging in development of apartment complexes and restaurants/bars. Not known for being a business hub like Canary Wharf, though; it’s the home to the Washington Nationals (city’s baseball team)",56,2021,11,2,1
2545,hkvn0ha,qv8awv,leffbehind,"Hi OP! As someone who moved from London to DC after grad school I hope I can give you a good perspective of everything here in DC. 

1. DC is *significantly smaller* than London. Anyone who has been to NYC/LA/SF will also tell you this, but from one seat of government to another, you will quickly realize that DC is a tiny fraction of the size of London. However, what's nice is that DC (in some areas) actually seems quite dense and slightly similar to European cities.
2. Public Transit will be good - in the context of transit in the US. European cities have decades of developed infrastructure for folks who don't have cars and the US is very much the opposite. DC however is one of the most walkable cities in the US and there are a host of different public transit options, as long as you are not to snobby to ride the bus (Moving from London where I bussed or tube everywhere I never understood some DC residents' need to turn their nose up at the busses.)
3. For your budget you will have plenty of options and, I would also aim for the West End (not much there, and a bit too close to college students at GW)/Dupont/Kalorama/Adam's Morgan/west of Logan Circle axis. These areas are *relatively* low crime, quiet, walkable, have plenty of shoppes and eateries, and you can meet new people. **However, noise level varies extremely based on the individual unit and the street(s) that it faces.** This is not satisfying, unless you have a buddy here already, but if you can - **tour the unit and linger as long as you can** ***in the unit*** **to accurately gauge the noise level of the individual unit.** I currently live in a building with a gorgeous unit that faces one of the loudest street corners in DC and will be moving next month out of Columbia Heights because of it - yet folks who live on the other side of the building have quiet and serene living spaces.
4. What may appear odd to you and will seem normal to most Americans is how DC, an urban city, has a *completely random arrangement of completely residential blocks* interspersed throughout the city (things like Swann St. NW). These are very cute and if you can manage to find a ground floor (not basement) unit in one of these in your price range, that is the golden ticket.
5. The weather is similar, but on the whole, better than London. The amount of days where it just lightly rains all day long (my most hated part of London) is relatively small. Summers in DC will be more humid and a bit hotter, and I'd actually say the winters are comparable. In general about 15-30% less rain and it's usually harder and quicker in duration.
6. Lots of churches, like, a lot, even considering that London has been inhabited since Roman times, DC has probably 20x the churches of London
7. Dogs Dogs Dogs - DC has very quickly become a city of dog-owners. This is I think a relatively recent advent in DC greatly accelerated by COVID, but there will be many many more dogs here, which I as a pet owner, love.
8. DC residents think they have a lot of rats/mice - they have never lived in London :D.
9. Do not believe anyone who says an ""Irish Bar/pub"" is good in DC, I am yet to find one.
10. U St. is generally too loud and busy, but there are quiet bubbles to be found. 
11. NoMa is still being gentrified/redeveloped in a piecemeal fashion so certain parts of it are very modern (and people love it) and other parts are very urban blight/empty lots/crime - and *it is far from the various other centers of DC young/exciting/interesting life except for the H St. corridor/Eastern Market.* 
12. Now I'll also give you an additional random list of trade offs:
   1. Higher Priced items in DC: 
      1. Theatre/Events tickets - Yes there are opportunities to get free/cheap tickets with good seats, but I went to a massive amount of plays, ballets, musicals, concerts, etc. in London for a nice chunk cheaper than here in DC. 
      2. Gym memberships - These are treated like a luxury good in DC and while there are some that have various tiers of pricing, you will likely get a bit of sticker shock - When I lived in London a new gym opened within 1-3 tube stops every 4-5 months, making pricing competitive. Gyms in DC are run/owned by about 4-6 companies who have no incentive to have competitive pricing (Avoid WSC if you can) -
      3. Healthcare - I will not bore you with the details, but it's a lot more expensive and it's something **you will need to budget for** unless you work at a tech company that pays all your premiums (this is rare, but happens)
   2. Cheaper items in DC
      1. Museums - London is good, but I'd argue that DC's got it beat on the massive volume of free museums/art galleries and the like
      2. **Housing - what you can afford for 2500 in DC will be palatial, modern, clean and in a great neighborhood compared to London flats.**
      3. Groceries - The difference here is not large, but it is enough that you will notice your spend at Harris Teeter/Safeway/Giant is probably slightly cheaper than your standard London Tesco. This scales so M&S prices>Trader Joes, Waitrose prices>Whole Foods
      4. **Utilities - these bills are A LOT cheaper in the US**

I can assure, it’s one of the BEST neighborhoods in DC! $2500 is the perfect price for 1BR in the area. Also, yes some of the buildings might appear “old”, but it’s perfectly fine because most of the apartments are clean and refurbished inside with all the modern equipments. It’s not completely modern but that a trade off to live in the best area. Search for a preferably“rent control” building with a good rental management company. DuPont & kalorama neighborhoods are also close to Adams Morgan- the best party scene in dc. Georgetown is also close by.

2560,hkvdv7e,qv8awv,emcee_gee,"I'm the same age as you are. I moved here in August and had the same budget. I do have a car, but I only use it on road trips; not for commuting or other regular activities. I bike and walk a lot and take the Metro when I go in to work. I had visited DC a handful of times over the last decade or so, so I already had a decent idea of the neighborhood vibes.

I chose the U Street area. Not _on_ U Street -- that would be too crazy/loud for me at this point in my life. But close enough that I still get the benefit of all the businesses and nightlife when I want to go out. I chose a condo building that wasn't _super_ new and didn't have all the flashy amenities, but had a relatively strong community of grown adults.

I'd recommend finding a Realtor to help you find a place. They don't generally work with the big property management firms; instead, they help you find individual condos listed by smaller landlords usually with only one or two units (often, places they themselves used to live). I've always been happier renting from individuals than companies; plus, with a Realtor, you get the benefit of having someone who takes the time to get to know you and what you're looking for, rather than having a bunch of 15-minute tours with different listing agents where you've got to ask all the same questions every time and you never really know how honest they're being. Realtors work on commission, generally taking the first month's rent from the landlord, so it doesn't cost you anything.

Skip NoMa unless living in a cheap new-ish apartment is important above all else (location, safety, etc.).  I don’t care for Mount Vernon Triangle, but if living in a new-ish building is important then you should consider it.  U Street is ok depending on where you’re talking about specifically, but if you mean actually on  U street it can be loud because there’s a lot of bars.  If you mean on 14th north of U I suggest you walk around at night and decide if you feel safe.  It can be really sketchy at night and during the day, and there’s a surprising amount of crime.  14th below U is totally fine. If you mean Columbia Heights, I’d select your location very carefully.

Skip Foggy Bottom and also West End unless you’re fine living nearly exclusively with college and grad students.  Don’t think you can avoid college students by living in an expensive building.

I work 3 blocks over (Farragut Square area). It's not feasible by walking, but I recommend Alexandria Old Town if bicycling is an option. Has metro access direct to DC, is very, very safe, cute cafes, gorgeous Old Town that reminds me a lot of the U.K. (it was a British colonial city after all), vibrant King Street with lots of restaurants and rowhomes. It's an urban city and feels like an extension of Washington, D.C., but still has that ""Hot Fuzz"" charm. It's the crown jewel of the metro area imo (though I moved out since it was getting DC-levels of expensive).

Honestly, Mount Vernon Triangle, U Street, and Noma are all recently-converted-transitional neighborhoods, so the ""urban frontier"" won't be too far away at any given point. So they may feel sketchy if you turn the wrong corner. Logan Circle is the gay district of D.C. It's a small cute district, but very expensive. Not sure if you swing that way, but if so, it's a great place to be (Dupont Circle is the former LGBT district, but now is for older gays + diplomats - since it abuts Embassy Row).

If it was just me who, like OP, has no desire to drive to work, and I was just using a car for pleasure trips, I might skip the car and rely on a mix of Free2Move (big fan, still cheaper than Uber) and regular rental cars. Zipcar might be worth looking into in that case, though I have always used the free2move car2go (RIP) model. But in OPs case I’m not sure if it’s worth going all in on a car he or she is guaranteed to not use probably 5 days a week.",0,2021,11,2,1

That being said there are also plenty of new builds or renovations that have gone up in the past few years, but they may be above your budget once you add in utilities and expenses.   Another option for you could be to look to rent from someone who owns a condo, often you get a better price that way.

I avoid Uber like the plague unless a dire situation (and because two drivers pulled up, my teen daughter put her hand on the door handle - I was behind her - and the driver sped off and cancelled the ride. Couldn't even complain.)

I figured out - and might be dissimilar to your situation - that Lyft has this ""priority service"" that is an outright scam. 

* For example, ""Pick up in 5 minutes, $17. Pick up in 10, $14. Pick up in 20, $10."" Except that if I pick 5 minutes, it can still take 15 and they charge me $20. If I pick 10 minutes, it can come in 5 minutes for $15...or in 20 minutes and they charge $15. Or I pick $20 and it comes in 5 minutes and I'm charged $17. There is absolutely no rhyme or reason. To me, this seems like it is against contract law. Can a store say, ""1 pound of tomatos for $5"" then you get to the cash register and it's $10?? No, that's illegal. Advertised price is advertised price. 
* The ride cancelling is RIFE. Sometimes I have had my ride cancelled 2-3 times before a driver actually comes. And I still pay more than advertised!  A couple years ago I missed two planes because of this. I left 2.5 hours before my flight at DCA and twice didn't make it because of the cancelled rides! Zero possibility to complain as there is no ride or driver to link the complaint to.

Another reason I am straight up Empower, Curb or regular taxi now. Empower might take a bit longer, but the drivers keep all fares except like $100 subscription fee a month.

The other thing is that a couple times I treated myself to a ""Luxury"" Lyft driver and they were all the worst, rudest drivers I ever had on Lyft. Who cares what they car was. One was so comical, I felt like I had been kidnapped my Russian mafia. And not like in a funny way.",25,2023,5,2,1

They’re non-profit orgs with a board of directors made up of the ratepayers/business owners, and they publish annual reports on their activities and how they used their money. They also have to go before the city council every 5 years to be renewed/reauthorized.

I could also add that if people weren't able to work remotely and the Federal Government was requiring people to come to their offices, the gridlock would be terrible.  I just don't think rooting for the core of DC to rot out with fewer people coming in is a good long term form of traffic planning.

Cutting off traffic flow from the Key Bridge would be tantamount to condemning Georgetown.  Traffic calming tends to blow up in the face of people doing it if they create gridlock, see Wisconsin Avenue in Glover Park.

And, no, it’s not dense to study the long term trends around homicides. The graph from 1900 onward is at least worth considering when we try to understand what’s normal or not around homicides. It’s useful to compare to other industrialized countries as well.

When it reopens, check out the theater at the Air and Space museum on the mall. Go to a movie after museum hours. It's really cool.

For music, Black Cat, Comet Ping Pong, Pie Shop, DC9, 9:30 Club, and Slash Run are some of my favorite music venues. 

It’s your first post-grad job too, and while I don’t know what field you’re in or what kind of work you’re doing, DC does have the reputation of having certain people *vastly* overestimate the importance or power associated with their job.

Even if it sounds far, walking might get you there  faster. My rule of thumb is that if it's less than a mile, I walk. Less than 3, I bike. Biking is often the fastest way to get around, full stop.

>The Connecticut Avenue Multimodal Safety Improvement Project (originally named Connecticut Avenue NW Reversible Lane Safety and Operations Study) was initiated in December 2019. Data analysis, concept development and evaluation, traffic forecasts, and operations analysis were conducted between Spring 2020 and Fall 2020. Between March 2020 and January 2023 approximately 70 stakeholder and agency presentations/events have taken place.

>**During 2021, four Advisory Neighborhood Commissions- ANC 3C, 3E, 3F and 3/4G -and numerous organizations provided resolutions to DDOT requesting that “Concept C” be advanced. On December 15, 2021, Mayor Bowser and DDOT requested the project staff to move forward with Concept C. Concept C includes the removal of the reversible lanes and the addition of one-way protected bicycle lanes on the east and west sides of Connecticut Avenue.** The project also adds other safety improvements, including the addition of left and right turn lanes at intersections, pedestrian refuge islands and curb extensions, intersection realignments, prohibition of Right Turn on Reds, reducing the posted speed limit from 30 mph to 25 mph, and other features.

>On March 19, 2020, the official start of the Covid-19 pandemic, the District Department of Transportation deactivated the operation of the Connecticut Avenue NW peak hour reversible lanes. A decision was subsequently made to permanently remove the peak hour reversible lanes. Removal of the reversible lanes’ signs and markings were completed in the summer 2022. In addition, one of the Concept C recommendations was to reduce the Connecticut Avenue speed limit from 30 mph to 25 mph. This action was also completed in summer 2022.

>**In early 2023, the DDOT leadership has requested that project staff take a fresh look at all of the concepts that were considered, including a reassessment of Concept C. DDOT has received a considerable number of comments during this past year related to the parking removals required to implement Concept C. This reassessment currently is occurring as of August 2023.**

>DDOT has recently reformulated our Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) for the project. This reformulation of the CAC has occurred because the boundaries of the Advisory Neighborhood Commissions and Single-member Districts have changed based on redistricting and the results of the latest decennial census. We expect that the first meeting of this reformulated CAC will occur in fall 2023.

I have had multiple people offer to buy my groceries with their SNAP/EBT cards if I will buy them something they can't buy with those. As far as drugs go, there is a lot of pot smoking out in the open; I don't give a shit but it is not legalized yet. Public urination in the alleys, it happens a lot by a lot of people, it's not really something you want to call the cops on, it is just a fact of life here. 

In short, little crimes that some people get killed for in other cities, but are not high priority for anyone who has lived here for awhile (like Chief Lanier).

3534,lzlzwyq,1h2s4bl,rachelella04,"Hey, I lived in rosslyn three years. To preface, I love DC and would live there over Rosslyn if the price and logistics were right for me. Noma might be a better fit for you, but I’ll share my experience in rosslyn at least: 

I loved taking the metro 10 mins or less to Soundcheck for EDM shows, to Metro Center and a short walk to Capitol One arena for bigger concerts or sporting events, or to Warner Theatre and DC improv for comedy shows. Also very convenient for events at the Kennedy Center. Look up the other music venues in DC like The Anthem (at the wharf), 930 club, Atlantis, songbyrd, echostage, flash, capitol one arena, Lincoln theatre, union stage, merriweather post pavilion, etc. Will help you see what the commute would be like to each (the Moovit app is good for public transit estimations).  Songbyrd would be right in your neighborhood in Noma, and Noma has an outdoor free concert series in the summer. Need to take a couple legs to get to several of the venues from rosslyn (eg need to transfer on metro from O/B/S to green line north to get to U st venues of 930 and Atlantis, or to green line south to get to wharf venues of Anthem and Union stage). But honestly when shows get out after 1 AM you’re likely going to have to uber/lyft home to noma or to rosslyn either way for most of these venues since our metro system doesn’t run too late here. I find Ubers/lyfts home to rosslyn decently affordable since by mileage it’s not far from DC proper. If there’s surge pricing, I just e-bike home instead — it’s honestly my fave mode of getting around DC since we have such robust bike lanes.

There’s a small social scene in Rosslyn if you’re looking to grab a beer right after work - there’s a neighborhood bar called Quinn’s that’s always busy.  Open road is also always busy during HH as is continental beer garden in warm months. Salt cocktail bar for something fancier. But as a whole like others have said, don’t expect any nightlife here or extensive restaurant and bar options. You can walk to  Clarendon for more restaurant and bar options, but lots of basic early 20 years old there, I always personally prefer the venture into DC proper for the actual DC cultural experience. So yes, you’ll have more options in noma. 

Re social clubs and sports, will prob have better access in Noma. I have friends on intramural teams that are based in noma, and my bf’s soccer teams are often in the district in navy yard or Shaw. 

Also re social life, I commented on someone else’s post that almost all my friends are in DC because I made an effort to spend time in DC, not Arlington. I have a single friend in Arlington and countless friends in DC. Its certainly helpful when my DC friends live or enjoy hanging out in neighborhoods most convenient for me to get to from rosslyn, such as DuPont circle, Georgetown, west end, foggy bottom, Chinatown, Logan circle. When I’ve had friends up in Columbia heights, petworth, Adams Morgan, or Mount Pleasant it’s more of a PITA by public transit to get to them. Some friends are more willing than others to pick a meeting spot that’s a good middle ground for both parties. And as the other poster said, some people are a bit immature about crossing over the river despite rosslyn being one metro stop (three mins) from the district. Now if they don’t want to take multiple legs of transit to get to someone that’s one thing, but if they live in Capitol Hill and would be open to taking O/B/S lines to foggy bottom, but not rosslyn, that’s just asinine imo. I had a rooftop pool I invited my friends to in the summer, and one of them literally gave me that as her rationale for passing - just tell me you don’t wanna come… But yeah, if you’re trying to date, I could potentially see it being an automatic swipe left when ppl see you’re in Arlington because of those mindsets, so to keep your options open, noma could be better in that sense (although I personally wouldn’t want to date someone so closed-minded lol)

Not sure how much crime matters to you, but noma’s is worse than rosslyn’s for sure. Nothing particularly wrong with that if you have a good head on your shoulders and have tolerance for some grunginess and sketchiness - chance of being assaulted is higher but many prefer neighborhoods with character and more crime over a bland area like rosslyn. The vibes in the two neighborhoods couldn’t be more different - night and day.
 
For me, I fly a lot - so I love that rosslyn gets me metro access to both DCA and IAD easily without transfers.  I value commute to work, airport access, safety, and love walking home from the metro late at night alone. So I accept that rosslyn itself doesn’t have a vibrant social life for me, and that there is an additional hassle of having to take the metro or bike to have access to DC vibes that I love, rather than being able to walk to them (cannot afford to live in DC / I don’t like the neighborhoods that I can afford).

As for the bus, I think buses are great! I've never had any major issues and any time someone has gotten out of hand (such as shouting or swearing a lot) the bus driver told the person to knock it off or they would kick them off. 

Or consider getting a bike or Capital Bikeshare membership - I use bikeshare to get from the metro to work (about 1 mile) and it is great!

Three thoughts:

1. Do not get into a set routine - leaving and/or coming home at the same time every day and taking the same exact route every day is a mistake anywhere. I feel very safe where I live (and my fiance is a 6' tall big guy with a beard) but I still make a point to vary my routine one day every week or two - leave 15 minutes earlier, come home slightly later, stop at the grocery store randomly, etc.

2. Consider carrying pepper spray or some other similar option. I used to in college, don't feel the need to anymore. I never needed it but it made me feel safer at the time. It also gave me more confidence and a better ""don't fuck with me"" attitude. Which leads me to ... 

3. If you walk around like you know where you are going and do not want anyone to mess with you most people will leave you alone. If you are staring at your phone (or otherwise distracted), looking around like you are lost, or are just generally unsure then it draws more attention.

First, if you have money to spare, help someone in need out. If not, you always have grace to spare. Take ten seconds to look a fellow human being in the eye, tell them you can’t help them right now, and wish them well.  

Second, if you have the time and skill to help someone who is clearly in trouble, do so. If the woman looked shaken up from being called a bitch, it’s ok to ask if she’s ok.

Third, have some empathy for people who are clearly having a tough day/week/month/year. You don’t have to excuse someone’s behavior in order to understand it.

I think the spirit of this post is essentially asking how do you act as a good bystander in these situations especially when it's a male shouting at a female.

This feels like a clear contradiction to me.

And local theater, and local art, and local musicians -- go to enough shows and in five or ten years you'll be seeing some of those people on TV and thinking ""I remember when I saw them in a bar in Adams Morgan!""  

I'm not aware of any New Year's comedy shows this year, but it wouldn't surprise me if they're happening.

It’ll take a Hudson Yards sized project to make it worthwhile. 

That also makes me think of the Fort Myer yards in Eckington. Such a waste of space right next to the metro! 

One idea that I think really has been underrated is adding a rail bypass of DC somewhere in NoVA and MD to free up the freight tracks that go through DC. If we can do this, we can realign all these tracks and rail yards, and provide better passenger service.

Also, a reason for the move away from this was the rampant corruption of those foot patrol officers who either was paid off to elected to turn a blind eye to a lot of the organized crime in their areas.  

Interestingly enough, our operations in Iraq up to 2007-2008 surge was very much like our police, we'd drive around in our humvees looking for or in many cases waiting for insurgents to engage us while conducting soft/hard knock searches at night. During the surge we conducted more foot patrols, integrated into our local areas in small COPs with local Iraqi police or Iraqi army units and created a much bigger and sustained presence versus daily patrols from our FOB. This marked at first large incidents of fighting because we were not embedded in our AOs but dropped shortly as we denied the insurgents freedom of movement and ability to operate within the local population.

4087,kjewb6w,19el7l2,thebarkingdog,"MPD here.

First answer: We don't have the officers. 

We're so short most Districts are holding over officers from the previous shift nearly every day to make minimum staffing. We weren't defunded, but the freeze in hiring by the council in 2020 will be felt for another decade. And we HAVE to staff the patrol cars first, and we can barely do that. 

Ex. 5 years ago, Adams Morgan and U Street had two units, 40 officers, 20 for each location in addition to regular patrol. That unit is now down to 15 officers for both locations.

Second Answer: Resource allocation. 

Contee made the news when he consolidated and made the all bike patrol unit a few years ago. Except it wasn't made up of new officers but instead, officers he pulled from the Districts. So those Districts lost their officers to other parts of the city.

Third: Practicality. 

Putting someone on a foot beat for 40 hours a week, wears on them. Now factor in weather, call volume, duties, training, etc. And you can see where it can go wrong. Also, for all the criticism of cops simply sitting in their cars, cars provide a safe place to sit, place to store food, gear, paperwork, a computer, and when an emergency comes out, nearby or across the District, officers need cars to get there faster than feet can.",32,2024,1,2,1

4133,kjduxdk,19el7l2,SnooFurtherQuestions,"As you said, residency requirements are a separate issue from community policing, but it’s related to the idea of a police force that views itself as an occupying force rather than a community asset. 

It’s not just about quality of policing with residency requirements, it’s about 1) maintaining a tax base and 2) having a police force composed of the people who actually live in the community. 

As your USA Today piece points out, white police officers tend to live in the cities where they worked when those cities were majority-white and white officers were also more likely to reside outside the city than their Black or Latino counterparts.

The piece also includes the argument that residency requirements should be more specific in order to be effective and require officers to live in the neighborhoods where they work. 

I don’t know if any program has included that much specificity or been enforced with any kind of effort beyond a cursory check of a provided address.

Ultimately, it’s hard to say definitively that residency requirements are helpful or not, as demographics of cities and police forces can vary depending on the municipality.",16,2024,1,2,1

Someone was just robbed at gunpoint on the front stoop of my apartment building LAST NIGHT. A terrifying experience, no doubt. However, I give you my cost benefit analysis of why it's still worth it to live in the hood.

Let's say you get mugged, and give them what they want, immediately (which, for the record, you should ALWAYS DO, without question). You'll end up losing your cash, nothing on credit if you call your company soon enough, and probably the fees to get a new license/ID, maybe your Smartrip, etc. Maybe you also lose your nice purse or wallet, but we'll say all of that is worth around $250. The biggest ""cost"" you'll face is the fear of being mugged. Say that is $1000 worth of fear to you (weird concept, but humor me here - this is how cost benefit analysis works). If you move to Near NE, KNOWING that you will get mugged, it becomes something that you're prepared for, and slightly less scared of. The cost of doing business, so to speak. You know it's going to happen, you're not going to get hurt if you hurry up and give the money and don't argue, and you have come to terms with that. And then it becomes a little less scary, and maybe you're only facing $500 of fear. That is now only $750 you're going to lose by being mugged. If it happens once a year (WAY more often than real life), that is a lot less than you're saving on rent by living in the hood. Of course, realizing all this and internalizing it makes the idea even less scary (although guns are still REALLY scary in person) so it's an even better deal.

I've lived around H st for 2 years and never had a problem. I've seen problems, and heard of them, and had them happen to my friends, but it hasn't happened to me yet. I'm prepared for it though, by assuming it WILL eventually happen. If the area gentrifies even more (which it appears to be doing), bonus! In fact, chances are you may never be mugged.

4544,cc9g072,1mhwjr,maker86,"I'm going to assume he has a few issues here.  First, the guy probably isn't using an assault rifle as most people define it.  The distinction has to do with whether the rifle can fire more than one bullet with a pull of the trigger.  It's unlikely that an automatic weapon would be used in a crime as they're fairly expensive and hard to come by.  If this is just a standard AR-15 type weapon, and that's what it sounds like, it would be more appropriately defined as an assault weapon (as opposed to assault rifle), though that term is often also met with hostility as it classes a weapon based more on appearance than functionality.

The other possible issue is that if this were instead an automatic rifle, say an M4 or M16, that fact wouldn't really matter much.  Automatic fire is seldom useful for anything but suppression, which means keeping the enemy under cover while friendlies reposition or evacuate.  It's true that automatic gun fire can kill many people quickly if they're all grouped together and not expecting it, but this situation has evolved past that now.

More useful information would be a whether its a standard rifle or a carbine, the caliber of the rifle, what kind of optics he has, does it look like he's carrying a lot of extra magazines, does he have any sidearms or specialty weapons like a shotgun for breeching, any kind of grenades, what other gear is he wearing, and does he have any kind of communication equipment.  I'm not saying that knowing if the rifle is capable of full auto is not useful information, but it is not as useful as the other information I've noted.  Additionally, the media has proven themselves unreliable in determining weapon types, so there's absolutely no reason to take them seriously in this regard.",5,2013,9,2,1

Recently, many longtime residents have retired and sold their houses to the folks many other commenters will assume already owned these houses. Some have been forced to sell because they couldn’t afford the real estate taxes on their dramatically appreciated houses.

While the new buyers today quite wealthy in many west-of-park neighborhoods, this was not always the case. The city was very different back when my parents bought their place in a whole host of ways. The dramatic appreciation in real estate values since the mid-90s, and the post-08 change in the mortgage process, has completely changed the profile of people who can buy here. 

Those younger buyers replacing my childhood neighbors are of course in the stereotypical industries. Those are the only people who can afford to buy those houses at market these days. Many of these folks are transient DC residents and not native Washingtonians who bought way before the housing market became what it is today. There’s no issue with new people moving here, it’s just that those folks are the only ones who can buy at market.

Mortgage, real estate taxes & upkeep are pretty close to rent.

This is also ignoring the fact that you are stuck paying a mortgage even if you don't live there, so there is the unrealized cost that comes from lack of quick mobility.

You don't really own your home until you have paid off your mortgage. You are just paying a rent to your mortgage company/local govt. instead of your landlord.

4837,hhj6cws,qcrzz5,The_Bard,"What you said makes no sense even on a surface level. You still pay for real estate tax and mortgage costs when you rent. It's just not itemized. Your  landlord isn't paying for those things out of the goodness of their hearts. It's baked into the cost of your rent. Sure you lose out on closing costs. But still, tell me in what world someone is able to pay for housing and save the  equivalent value of the equity they gain on their home each month.

Yes there are upfront and backend costs to sale. Yes there is tax and insurance and interest costs. But all these exist in commercial real estate as well and are passed on to the renter. 

Also to describe a mortgage as not owning the house until the end of the mortgage is totally inaccurate. If that were the case you wouldn't see a dime selling the house before the mortgage was up. You own the value of the house minus the amount owed to the mortgage lender. 

The premise of your point is still faulty. There is no where I've lived where renting an equivalent property cost less than a mortgage including property tax, interest and insurance.

The problem is not that you still pay for housing when you purchase your home because those costs are explicitly laid out when you buy the house. The problem is indeed that if you invest your down-payment and don't buy a house, you still have to pay the equivalent of a mortgage and all related costs to house yourself. There isn't magic extra money to invest.

You act like you've got all these gotchas that no one has considered, but literally everyone understands the costs. And literally every one is passed on to the renter. You can tell by the cost of rent being higher or equivalent to a mortgage and all associated costs.",2,2021,10,2,1

I full ass wouldn’t do this, but also I’m a woman and have seen a *lot* of this style post and it’s usually a scam or some dude being like “FREE RENT! looking for a female roommate 18-25 willing to share a studio. Must be in shape, clean the apartment, cook me three meals, and share my bed” style bullshit. 

If we are going to look past that, here are a few thoughts:

Have you ever shared a studio before? I know you said you’re fine with it, but until you’ve done it you might not be thinking about some of the practical challenges it entails. I shared a studio with my now husband when I first moved here and we were waiting for his lease to run out. Sharing a space with no walls can be awkward even if you are in a relationship with the person. I can’t imagine sharing one with someone I didn’t know.

Think about things like sleep habits, different levels of cleanliness, etc. When you have a roommate but each have your own bedroom it creates the idea of private vs. shared space. The general consensus among every roommate I’ve ever had is that your bedroom can be as messy as you want but the common space is to be kept clean as a courtesy to your roommates. A studio, even a large one, could create an environment where one of you wants to be awake when the other wants to be asleep, or where one person keeps things very tidy and the other person lets their “bedroom” area king of take over.

This isn’t to say dude is a bad guy—although of course you are correct to be wary of assault, sexual violence, theft, etc when moving in with anyone—but someone’s annoying habits become a lot more annoying when you can’t get away from them. Additionally, it will likely always feel like his space and not your home. What happens if one of you meets and brings them home or someone wants to entertain? 

If you do go for it, I’d definitely take the small dressing room area and put a single bed in there, lock the door and be done with it. That said, it could produce its own challenges, if you’re in the dressing room that means he now needs to get dressed and ready entirely in the bathroom, or else he’s just naked in the common space, which is awkward.

Did you get a chance to talk to him about his lifestyle at all? What hours he’s home, what time he needs to get ready for work, when/if he entertains at home, and the like?",3,2023,10,2,1

It was quite obviously an illegal sublet situation, and I knew that going in, but I was young and stupid and just figured it would work out. 

One day he said he was moving back to the states and that my roommate and I had, 15 days to vacate. And he could do that because there was no protection for us since we were subletting illegally. I ended up finding an apartment but couldn’t move in until the end of the month which meant moving all my shit to a storage unit and couch surfing for a few weeks then moving into the new place, which was very annoying.

If you don’t have a lot of stuff (e.g. you won’t have to get a storage unit) and the dude didn’t seem creepy it could work, but it is RISKY in terms of personal safety and housing security.

Request an officer to come to your house , and report a threats to do bodily harm (hate crime based on race, and color) provide the offender description to the officer.

The officer will provide you a report number also known as CCN .  The officer will advise you on second sighting.

The way second sighting  works, if you ever come across the offender again. You call 911 provide the call taker the CCN FOR THE THREATS TO DO BODILY HARM, and advise its a second sightin. Provide the  clothing description and the  location of the offender(EX. OUTSIDE LIQUOR STORE, OR STANDING WITH A GROUP OF PEOPLE  NEXT TO A WHITE FORD). 

Officers will respond and arrest him on scene without you having provide details about the crime, since the information will be in the intial report by the  officer who responded to you.

If the officer ask you why you didn't call at the time, advise them that you did call 911, and  you felt the need to report  it since there is a possibility you see him again. Also report that you belief he's capable of committing the threat.",25,2022,1,2,1

Oh racism is really bad for the interracial folks. 

Death threats? It would be the everyday occurrence. We actually would bet what would be said or who was going to scream “Cracker” “white boy” or whatever racist term could be thought of.

It was daily life. From this post it’s still life in DC.

People think racism is rampant in the country in the red states.
It is.
But it’s also in our inner cities where white people are targeted for the color of their skin. I know I’ve been targeted many times on M street going home. A man threw firecrackers at me while I was walking and laughed. I’ve had boards thrown at my wheels as I was scootering.

The prosecutor (Asst AG for race-based incidents!) explained that because of the enhancement, the assailant will be psychologically evaluated and can receive affordable, timely anger management / mental health counseling. She also said that they will be detained until the detention hearing as a public safety concern if you are worried about your assailant threatening people in the area. If there is no outstanding criminal record, you can even ask for diversion, which means the charge will not go on their permanent record and they will instead do stuff like community service.

The only way your 911 call didn't even go through is if your phone itself didn't have a connection to the towers or some kind of software bug on your phone.

I'd recommend you reach out to your cell phone service provider and file a complaint. They should take ""not able to call 911 in the middle of a city"" fairly seriously, 1 because it makes them liable if something would have happened and 2 they weren't in compliance with the FCC regulations surrounding your phone having to be able to contact the emergency line.

A vast majority of DC crime is poor young black men on other poor people. So if you are not a poor person that knows poor young black men, I don't think the risk is as clear as it seems. I don't think there is good data on crime perpetrated by strangers against non-poor people (which I assume the average user of this subreddit to be). 

I am not trying to minimize and say any life is worth more than another. The murder rate is morally abhorrent. But I think what people are really worried about is the risk to themselves, and these overall murder rates are likely not a good indicator of that for a lot of people.  

For me the easy risk comparison is driving on a highway. My gut says that the risk you trade off of not getting randomly murdered in DC is probably around the risk you take on of dying in a car accident if you move to the burbs.

I understand those things; I understand that if you don't go to certain parts of the city, don't engage in crime or gang/crew related activities, and are generally self-aware, you're not likely to be a victim of violent crime in the city.

I'm also not new to this city. I've lived here for 10+ years. I used to rent a garage in an alley in Trinidad and saw some real sketchy shit. I worked for an electric scooter/moped company that sent me to parts of the city that likely very few people on reddit have ever experienced. In all that time, never experienced anything more than package theft and rarely felt unsafe. I'm male if that matters.

However, 3 weeks ago 2 men robbed me at gunpoint 2 blocks from my home, on a street where most of the homes are $1 million+ (no bragging here, I rent). This was at 3pm on a Sunday afternoon, literally in front of people pushing strollers. A week later, my wife was chased down the street by a man who physically tried to grab her. Same neighborhood; same 7 figure homes. Reiterating that I understand statistical probability, and that I'm unlikely to ever experience that again, the random nature of what happened to me is impossible to defend against. And while I agree that this subreddit is crime-obsessed, I think you do a disservice to your neighbors to brush off crime so flippantly.

Yep, this is an anecdote. But the data show that violent crime is both increasing and is less geographically isolated in DC in recent years.

And so certain crimes have to be overlooked so they can ensure cries like murders etc get prosecuted. At least this is my understanding.

Again, you're incoherent, but if you're trying to say that the drop in DC's prosecution rates was in line with national trends, then you're once again completely wrong. USAO's prosecution rates are abysmal in a comparative sense. [NYC on average declines to prosecute 11% of felonies and 17% of misdemeanors.

Search for DC Crime Cards and look at the map (for some reason the map doesn't work on Chrome, so you'll have to use Edge or Safari). Filter the map to show all violent crime with or without a gun in the last 2 years. It'll give you insight on the neighborhoods that are safest.

Generally speaking from hanging out there, and this could just be a pre versus post covid thing, you know where not to go in Chicago. Around here, I can be coming out of Comet and someone can hop out of a car and just start beating the shit out of someone at the bus stop. Tanner park had a damn drive by. I was in a liquor store- a pretty nice one in northwest- and 3 girls came in and ran away with a whole end cap. Walked into lost gen one time and a dude had been mugged on a run at 3:30 pm (that was the guy who mugged 18 or so people in a stretch of a week). That’s not happening on the lake trail in broad daylight out there, IIRC. There were a series of assaults and a murder at Catholic, I don’t think that’s happening at DePaul (though maybe it is, I dunno). Kids throwing rocks at people on a trail is just normalized here. Maybe it doesn’t percolate up into the news in other cities, but one city I lived in which people think of as much worse than DC one bad kid trying to fight a lady on a trail was in the news for a week, and here it’s just Tuesday. 

I haven’t lived anywhere where a universal piece of advice is “avoid transit when school gets out.”

These are all parts of town where, you know, generally they’re pretty nice- some were not nice not too long ago- but you will either witness some shit, or get there shortly after some shit has happened, and that’s just not very common in other cities in the US and we shouldn’t pretend it is. 

Maybe it’s just post COVID there’s a mean shift down everywhere, and bullshit is more likely to pop off everywhere, I dunno, I suspect that’s true. But people in DC normalize insane things as “city living” and as someone who has lived in medium to large US cities their entire adult life- and in some neighborhoods that still haven’t transitioned- that stuff just isn’t normal.

I still think crime is acceptably pretty rare. And I’m not going to be targeted or have family targeted, so I’m not too too worried. But it’s crazy to me how it pops up everywhere. This is before we get into the “dealing with the bullshit of everyday life” like interacting with city services- which can either go weirdly smoothly, or can… not.

Creating more housing downtown solves a lot of problems. Creates a local customer base to better support retail, which was super dependent on the officer workers who aren’t coming back no matter how much Bowser whines about it. Busier streets are also less likely to fall into being hotspots for antisocial behavior like drug dealing. And obviously the region desperately needs more housing overall.

The trouble is in convincing the private market that a 95% leased residential building is better than a 60% full office building. Office rents are way higher per square foot.

Every one of the Downtown Zones has a housing requirement except D-7, which covers a couple blocks between the White House and 9th st. So if that’s the area you’re talking about then I guess you’re right but all the other D-XX zones have a housing requirement.

Because property managers typically don’t want to manage more than one kind of tenant, they’ll usually do “swaps” of the required residential and commercial space between properties in the same zone, so while the building itself might not be mixed, the area is. This is something that has to be OKd by the zoning commission (or maybe the zoning administrator? Don’t remember)

That said I do agree there’s not NEARLY enough housing downtown, and the housing ratio requirement for D zones and MU zones should be a lot higher IMO.

802,kx0rm0r,1bpvvu3,The-20k-Step-Bastard,"It’s adjacency. Urban designers (especially Jane Jacobs who first documented this) assert that neighborhood vibrancy comes from mixed use at all times of day. 

If Chinatown ONLY exists for sports, and only like 100 nights a year, then the remaining 2/3rds of the time is just opportunity for it to spiral. 

You’ve got 395/395 tunnels and giant faceless government buildings to the east, the lawns to the south, and the White House to the west. The only truly healthy thing around it is Mt. Vernon/Logan circle to the north, and people aren’t often walking/biking from their homes in Logan circle to the NGA every day of the week. And L’Enfant station area is the worst example of well-planned urban design, it’s a dour and desolate area of just loading docks in the side of massive office buildings. And right after that? Another highway. And THEN the Wharf. And then the water. 

If Chinatown had the Logan Circle / Mt. Vernon stuff on all four sides of it it would be the best place in the city. But shitty urban design and urban highways constricts it. 

One way to fix this would be to build massive amounts of dense housing in both Chinatown and in the rest of the city. Neighborhood competition doesn’t really happen the way you describe. It’s like the Chum Bucket and the Crusty Crab, or Bob’s Burgers versus Jimmy Pesto. In real life, relationships between businesses and neighborhoods aren’t like that. An adjacent neighborhood improving will directly improve Chinatown, because now there are more people with adjacency who will walk or bike through Chinatown in their daily lives - instead of people in Bethesda taking the red line down to watch a basketball game. 

You want organic, mixed use street life that includes early morning joggers, then construction workers going to their pre-dawn starts, then white collar people going to work, then the people at home taking their toddlers to the parks, then the office people getting lunch, then the students walking home from school, then the office people walking home after work, then the couples getting dinner, then the youngsters meeting for dates, then the party guys hitting the bars, then the high school k’noodlers kissing in the park, then the next day it starts all over again. This requires density in adjacency, better walking/biking access, better safety (more patrols, more lighting), parks, mixed use developments, easily crossable streets, and more.

IMO, You also need a neighborhood to be able to stand on its own as a mixed use place, and not just be a hanger-on. So yeah you can do all those BIG changes to the city’s infrastructure, and they’d be worthy and worthwhile changes, but I do genuinely believe you need to change a lot of the building uses IN downtown and Chinatown as well. But clearly the market isn’t there yet, so you need to use carrots (housing in downtown tax abatement) or sticks (stop approving tax assessment write downs for office vacancy?) to get private owners to make that change.

So TL;DR yeah I don’t really fundamentally disagree with you, I just think you need both.",2,2024,3,2,1

DC is also very generous regarding property taxes to senior citizens and those facing hardship. And they limit how quickly taxes can be raised annually.

I just recently finished serving grand jury duty, and for the two months I served we heard over a hundred cases, and - while it's hard to remember precisely - more than a couple dozen were PCP cases. MPD is constantly doing buy/busts, sending undercovers in, doing patrols and sweeps. I know that they focus their limited resources where problems are the worst, and sometimes their hands are tied on how much they can legally do, but they aren't doing nothing.

I don't know what else to say or what the solution is, but I wouldn't blame MPD as the primary source of the problem.",59,2019,8,2,1

One homeless man who habitually commits sexual assaults [has been arrested over 70 times and has been profiled by the Washington Post because of this.](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/suspect-in-attack-of-pregnant-woman-has-over-70-arrests)

DC has a bail system in which the City does not require people post cash bail. There is [research](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/incomejails.html) that points out that cash bail has a particularly hard hitting effect on racial minorities. Judge Morrison of DC Superior Court is a champion of this cause. He said in an interview with NPR that, [""[In 2017], we released 94 percent of all the people that we arrested without using money. Eighty-eight percent made every single court appearance, and 86 percent were never arrested for any criminal offense of any kind. And of the very small percent of people that were arrested in D.C. that we released, less than 2 percent were rearrested for a crime of violence.""](https://www.npr.org/2018/09/02/644085158/what-changed-after-d-c-ended-cash-bail) The thing I think that is interesting about his quote is that he says that ""less than 2 percent were rearrested for a crime of *violence.*"" In 2016 the Washington Post examined this and came up with the figure that [out of 100 released, 11 are rearrested, and 2 are rearrested for violent crimes,](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/when-it-comes-to-pretrial-release-few-other-jurisdictions-do-it-dcs-way/2016/07/04/8eb52134-e7d3-11e5-b0fd-073d5930a7b7_story.html) which is consistent with his claim, but more complete. That represents a 11% ~~recidivism~~ offense rate overall for those released. The data also may not paint full picture because just because someone commits a crime does not mean that they are going to get caught. It is worth noting that the same article notes that the Metro stabbing that occurred a few years ago involved a perpetrator who was released on bail 2 days prior on a misdemeanor charge. 

DC uses a computer system to calculate whether a person should be re-released or held with regard to bail. It looks at 70 factors and apparently, all things considered, operates on a presumption of release. I'd be interested in seeing what those factors are and if they are enough. It would also be interesting to see how many people are held pretrial in other jurisdictions versus DC's numbers. These incidents are really damaging to DC as a community and if this system is lax, then it needs to be ratcheted up.",48,2019,8,2,1

Yeah, you try it then come back and bitch about MPD giving no fuck's.  This case seems to be unusual in that this wasn't a career violent criminal perp who was on early parole release, probation before judgment, or some other form of justice ""reform"" bullshit where idealism is favored over the facts that early release of violent criminals oftentimes leads to those criminals physically assaulting or even murdering someone else, but we don't like to talk about those who were victims of violent criminals given third/fourth/tenth chances, nah, because there will always be collateral damage that can be justified by the end goal, right?  Nah, we just ignore people who were hurt/killed by idealism and emotional ""rationalizing,"" facts and logic be damned, and obviously the rights of a couple of violent criminals who might actually go on to not be violent again during the early release period is more important than the rights of the public who gets to deal with the violence of those who aren't going to live without being violent.  You want to stem violent crime?  Maybe get real with violent people.  Stop DAs from all these pleas to lesser charges, stop with probation before judgement on its face as the status quo, make this an offer ONLY after the violent criminal has proven they are very likely to not re-offend.

After that I kept my mace on my keychain, and walked with it already in my hand with safety off if I felt I was in an unsafe position.

I don't think people think these things through. Are you really gonna walk around with a loaded gun in your hand? Because if not, for *many* circumstances, you won't have time to grab it and flick the safety off. There are some circumstances where you could have it in your hand and not have enough response time to fire.

- How every neighborhood has a similar, but different vibe. Idk how to explain it but I mainly hang out at the wharf (near where I work), Capitol Hill, Dupont Circle and Shaw neighborhoods and I love them for different reasons.
- There are so many different cuisines to try! 

- The desire to support local businesses is strong.

- Communities are also really strong (i.e. the art community)

- The ability to participate in important, arguably historic protests or other types of moments is available to me at a leisure. For example, I’m able to pop over to the Supreme Court for a protest after work. This is something I really try not to take for granted.

- Cultural events! I am so, so grateful to be able to enjoy events by embassies, the Kennedy Center,  the Museums, etc. — and any other smaller events that bring communities together. 

- The recreation in this city is fantastic. Between what you can do on the Potomac to exploring Rock Creek Park or the arboretum to just hanging out on the National Mall on a nice summer day is perfection.

(1) DC has an incredible high end dining scene for its size. I'm relatively certain it has the most Michelin stars per capita in the US (if we generously associate the likes of the French Laundry with SF). The starred restaurants are also very varied in their speciality and price point, you can probably get out of Rooster & Owl with a tasting menu & a bottle of wine for ~$130pp all in while you could do Minibar and easily blow $500+ per person.

Even outside of the star circuit, you've got places like Marcel's which are superb.

(2) There are 3 relatively easily accessible airports with almost every major city covered with a direct flight. The competition also keeps a lid on prices, you'll find a flight you can afford even if you have to trek out to BWI (my least favorite of the 3 needless to say!), we aren't hub captive like folks in Charlotte would be to AA for example. 

For bonus points: you absolutely cannot beat a river visual approach into DCA sitting on the DC side on the plane, or indeed taking off to the north. A free sightseeing flight on every departure. Side note that for avgeeks here, Gravelly Point & Udvar-Hazy are fantastic to have accessible.

(3) The weather. Sure it gets hot in July/August, but we have relatively mild weather, mostly no significant disruptive events to worry about (one off derechos aside!) and a tangible 4 seasons, even if we're struggling for some powder this year.

(4) The ability to travel 3ish hours from here and get a completely different experience. NYC. Delaware/MD beaches. Shenandoah. VA vineyards. Snowshoe. Most places are lucky to have one of those things accessible.",43,2023,1,2,1

As a southern person who lived in suburban or rural areas most of my life, I find NYC to be a bit too chaotic and impersonal to be appealing. I always wanted to live in a big, but not too big city, and D.C. is the happy middle ground.

There are four seasons but none are too extreme. It's super walkable with robust public transportation networks. You don't need a car, but a car can be helpful. Plus we have three airports and Amtrak to connect you to other cities on the East coast, which makes it a great launchpad for getting elsewhere in the country or around the world.

Much of the shopping, food, culture, sports, arts, activity, and nightlife that can be found in large cities can be found here to some extent. D.C. is expensive but, due to it's regional nature, there is more ""value"" to be found here in terms of trade offs that must be made for the sake of lifestyle vs cost of living.

Personality wise, D.C. is slightly less superficial than places like NYC, LA, and Miami. While people here are still status driven, and elitism and wealth culture still remains very much a part of D.C. social life, people do seem to genuinely value and appreciate intellect and career accomplishment a bit more than beauty and materialism.

1302,jzohdyh,10n3bb6,Euphoric_AlgaeGum,"Ok this is going to be a long one!  First let me speak on the crime:

YES there is crime.  These days certainly your demographic does not matter.  This is very interesting because there was a time when non-marginalized (YT) residents in DC felt they were above it all.  They could be living in a high-end neighborhoods walking there dog happily 2 blocks over from a marginalized (POC) neighborhood at 2:00 am and not worry if there was a shoot-out ensuing.  The knowing (privilege) that you would remain unharmed and protected by law enforcement because of the color the (YT) color of your  skin put these residents in box of safety.  Where crime response by law-enforcement remained biased, violent and unproductive in marginalized neighborhoods.

Today...it DONT MATTER who you are!  The color of your skin DONT MATTER!  You are not above what's going on now!   Most of the crimes are being perpetuated by youth ages 11-17.   Girls...especially are joining these crimes spree's alot more too.  And surprisely the local media are being un-biased finally in whose performing crimes in the city.  Alot of the adult robberies and murders in the DMV area are showing YT faces!  Robberies in stores, domestic violence murders, a drunken fight turned bad.  Finally, the truth, this is not new!  It's just now televised.

A large percentage of these children have been found also to be ""honor roll"" students or ""perfect attendance"" students performing crimes in their school uniforms just seeking a thrill.  Our city has been left scratching their head.  Not all of   
 these children are of marginalized backgrounds.  There is an uprise of fights and violence in the schools.  DC no longer carries the Mayor Barry Summer Youth program and the after-school working programs that was once a component to keep children off these streets and emploring values by means of employment.

This is not the old 90's crime... THIS is the new 2020's crime!

Now, other than that...  
DC is a VIBRANT CITY to live and play in.  Although the cost-of living is high as hell, but the opportunities here matches the lifestyle to afford it.  There is much gentrification taking place here but not without also adding some development value to some once marginalized areas and offering programs of living to these newly re-developed areas.  HOWEVER, it's affecting ELDERLY residents very badly with no resources to re-locate or afford what options they are being giving.  

DC has the sports, kick-ass music venues, museums, the shops, fun-bars, politics, casinos across the ways, clubs, parks, great family fun and just a wonderful diverse culture!  Marijuana can now be consumed publicly too-lol.  There is SO MUCH here.  

 We are the creators, heartbeat and home of GO-GO music! But that's another tread! lol.  New incoming residents tried to silence GO-GO music being played at city events and street corners...but that went badly!  DC Native's here that grew up on the music or are a part of the new and old bands will not be muted so they held a rally!  Another DC win!

Would i recommend moving here or visiting here from wherever you are coming from?...ABSOLUTELY!  The best knowledge is from the experience itself!  Please feel free to ask me any questions you'd like to know?  I've been here for 40 years, yes i've moved a few times before but DC keeps calling me back!",3,2023,9,2,1

Along the Orange Line, Cheverly and New Carollton are nice areas, Cheverly in particular is very popular with young families wanting to live close to DC. It is unfortunately not walkable to much aside from the Metro station and the local parks. Maybe someone else can chime in with ideas on the Blue Line. 

Other communities in PG County on the Route 1 Corridor (Mount Rainier, Hyattsville, College Park/University Park) are diverse, welcoming and more walkable to businesses and restaurants.

This new neighborhood seems like 4/10 White, 4/10 Black, 2/10 other.  As an Asian-American, I'm pretty happy with this.  That neighborhood I used to live in actually was like 9/10 White in the 80s-90s but that gradually those White people moved into rural areas because of scary minorities (I know this personally because one of my best childhood friends moved down to the Eastern Shore.  His parents were cool but unfortunately they were pretty racist, even if they were always kind to me, a shy Asian kid).  

Welcome to NOVA I guess, we're a Northern city right on the edge of the South, so we get a good mix of people.

1488,gr75j0v,m6nlgp,djk29a_,"FWIW, the reality to buy a house is things kinda suck until you can save up 20% down (kinda hard when I lost all my down payment in the last recession) and the NOVA real estate market is so inventory limited buyers are getting outbid on terrible junk 1950s houses with $800k+ in cash and offering zero contingencies so essentially you need ~$1MM in liquidity to comfortably buy a house here. Otherwise there’s a smattering of condos and townhouses with HOAs that are also quite expensive once total costs are factored in.

Instead, I bought in PWC a couple years ago, suck up the commute, and am saving money faster for our next house than if I rented or ate rice and beans for 6 years. In fact, probably never going to buy within the beltway. I lose out on the ridiculous appreciation there, but after I lost all money before with a house I’m not risking doing that crap again.",9,2021,3,2,1

Your commute would be fairly easy too since you can hop on the 395 if driving and cross the bridge quickly to Arlington, or take the metro. Some of the other neighborhoods I have seen recommended here are going to have much longer commutes. The easy access to the 395 from NOMA/Eckington can’t be overstated. It’ll make errands and getting out of town so much easier. 

The only potential downside might be parks. I’m not sure there are as many as in other neighborhoods, but I could be wrong. I believe I read somewhere that NOMA has a bit of a green space problem, but that was years ago and maybe things have changed",6,2021,3,2,1

If it's any consolation:

* Re: safety - the vast majority of people who rob houses don't come back. Although of course your sense of security is shattered, many times these kinds of burglaries are almost professional. They come in, know exactly what they're looking for and leave the place trashed.
* Do you know what they took? Our burglars were focused on guns, jewelry and handbags. They could have totally taken our cars and we saw they opened the drawer with the keys in them, but the cars were untouched and all technology were untouched (didn't steal TVs - an ipad was laying on the coffee table and it was untouched.) Makes us feel a little better that they weren't going to come back and were definitely professional.
   * They even could tell the difference between the real and fake diamonds.
   * They were not interested in any identity theft type things
   * They stole small safes (pro-tip: put airtags in smaller safes that can be transported bc even if they can't access them immediately, they can take them and crack them later)
   * Knowing what they took can help sus out motives and likelihood that they'd be back
* Call the police. Although there's probably not a lot they can do, they can alert local pawn shops. They also brought in a person to sweep for prints (although they didn't find anything.) They also got a guy to come at 2am to board up our massive window that was shattered. Also they were helpful in reassuring us that most likely in our case 1) they wouldn't come back and 2) they were not looking for ID theft stuff and just wanted the guns and jewelry to sell. You will also need a police report for insurance. The cops in our case were also just super nice and understanding and gave us more info on the likely profile of the perpetrators.

For Prevention:

* alarm systems are great, even in apartment buildings. we were dumb and left ours off in a false sense of security so there was a week long window where this could have happened to us and we had no idea

* Take pictures of jewelry/items if you have a lot of them so if it's taken you know. Sometimes you may forget what exactly was stolen
* Airtags in small safes, and understand that small safes are not a deterrent in these situations

- have someone stay at your house if you plan on being away for more than couple days;
- install cameras 
- have a security alarm system (most connect to the police)
- avoid advertising your whereabouts - people may use this to know when to strike . Btw, not suggesting that you do

Plus they depreciate goods so like one of my handbags that I just got a month prior they were going to reimburse only like 75% so even with insurance you still have to prove a lot of stuff and that can be hard if you can't remember everything that was taken or have paper trails for everything.

We did have the serial numbers to the guns and reported them to the police so if a crime was committed with those guns they were listed as stolen.

The sucky thing was that passports were in the small safe they took, and honestly if they knew it was passports they probably wouldn't have taken it (based on what they did and didn't steal). But that was a NIGHTMARE because we were traveling internationally soon and the rush passport thing is a total shitshow right now.

Fun story - I went there for my college graduation back in 2012. We were CELEBRATING. we were a party of about 12 - my immediate family, my parents best friends, boyfriend at the time and some other people. Needless to say, we spent a lot of money. And we wanted to see the view of the Capitol on the roof. It was a Saturday and there was wedding, but the staff was amazing and was like “you can go up, but you have to come down immediately.” 

We go up and stand to the side to take pictures. And suddenly my dad and his best friend coming running and are like “uh we gotta go”. They had tried to crash the wedding bar! These two boomers in their kahkis and sports coats tried to blend in at a black tie wedding. The bartender was like “name the bride and groom” and they were like “touché” 

So we go downstairs and get ready to call a million cabs bc it’s 2012 and Uber doesn’t exist. And my dad’s friend comes over and says “I got us a ride” and we go, “all of us?” And he goes “yea” 

Well, he had talked to the wedding limo and said “I’ll pay you $100 in cash if you drive us to our hotel and we promise not to touch anything” and the driver said “deal, the bride and groom don’t leave for another 2 hours”. So we took the limo back to the hotel.

1652,lyw1wbr,1gzcsgu,_fFringe_,"I made a similar move, from Richmond District in San Francisco to Southwest DC, one block south of the beltway. It was… a big change. DC is a very different city and the DMV is a very different type of region than the Bay Area. 

Personally I miss the beaches most of all. If you get the same feeling, and have a car or rent a car, you can drive out to the Chesapeake Bay, which is nice, but there is nothing like Ocean Beach or Stinson Beach. You’d have to drive out about 2-3 hours to get to Delaware or Virginia Beach and even then it’s a totally different vibe. Tons of nice parks and forests in the DMV, though. Just look on maps for green, just outside the city; most of the time it’s a public park. 

There is not a lot of independent movie theaters like in SF, the two to four screen theaters that pepper the Richmond District, not really a thing in DC. But the museums are great and there is a lot of culture here, it’s just a different vibe—not necessarily better or worse, just different. I ended up settling down here, but still miss the west coast.

Oh and the drivers are much worse here than they are in the Bay Area but the traffic is not quite as bad. Public transportation is a million times better in DC, too. Rent is just as high in the Capitol Hill area as it is in SF.

Lots of great restaurants in the city proper but once you get to the suburbs it can drop off pretty quick. Bombay Street Food has the best Indian food, Rasika a close second. Good Mexican food is a bit harder to find, compared to SF; I love Surfside and El Bebe in SW/SE, close to Capitol Hill, but only discovered them the last year before moving to Silver Spring. Sanphan for Thai food in Capital Hill. Good Italian is oddly enough really hard to find. Il Radicchio in Arlington, VA is great, my favorite, but a bit of a drive or train ride from DC. 

Pizza doesn’t compare to San Francisco. There are great pizza places here but it’s a different style altogether. Not a lot of that sloppy molten-cheese-and-sauce SF pizza that I sometimes feel like I would kill for. I adjusted after a year or two, to the restaurants here and am of the opinion that there is quite a lot of great restaurants here.",8,2024,11,2,1

All three of those areas are pretty residential. So not too loud or crowded. Lincoln Park has the park lots of people like to walk or run around.

Are any or all of them offensive? Or is it just a very specific interpretation of a how a different usage of “chinamen” has been used in the US, even if that’s not exactly the same usage here?

It’s almost akin to someone getting offended if someone who spoke polish calling someone “polak,” which literally just means pole in polish, but has been used offensively in the US.

Keep in mind that, traditionally, law school classes are taught using the ""socratic method,"" which involves calling on people randomly (not waiting for a raise of hands), and then basically humiliating people who cannot answer the question correctly.  So, rough treatment is par for the course in law school.  
However, while law school professors may ridicule an unprepared student for being unprepared, they do not attack the person per se, so they don't regress to calling attention to the physical characteristics of the student.  
So, even in the context of a law school class, I think it is a mistake to call on people based on their physical characteristics (of the person themselves, not their clothes), but I suppose there is no bright line.  I think your examples of ""Mr. Black Person"" and ""Mr. Latino"" would be unacceptable, along with ""Mr. Gay Man,"" ""Ms. Short Lady,"" ""Mr. Missing Front Tooth,"" etc.  Referring to an article of clothing seems safe, ""Mr. Blue Shirt,"" ""Ms. Kate Spade Handbag.""",2,2022,2,2,1

You might not see the statistics (crime stats get juked) but my friends/neighbors see it all the time.

And please don't tell me it's not as bad as the 90s.  Even in this article, which sounded like a bullshit lede, there are facts:

\-32 percent increase in homicides from 2022

\-Property crime in D.C., however, has increased by 32 percent since last year — with a 109 percent increase in car thefts.

\- 2 in 3 D.C. residents (66 percent) are “very concerned” about gun violence in the area

\-Half (48 percent) say \[Very concerned\] about carjackings.

And that's whats reported. There's a lot that doesn't get reported because everybody wants things to look better.

&#x200B;

How the fuck do you not believe this? On Sunday, I saw young kids that I can only guess stole a stationary car or car jacked somebody  and they were going on a sweet ride with DC MPD police behind them (honestly, they shouldn't try to ram that car full of what looked like 10-14 year olds IMO).

Also heard semi-automatic fire three days ago and DC MPD basically said to my ANC that it sounded like semi-automatic fire but will never put that in a police report.

&#x200B;

Seriously...where do you live? I mean, I love D.C. and wish the best, but this shit is going crazy, and the only way we can improve things is to not make bullshit comments like ""It's not thaaaaaat bad!""

Or walk away from large groups of teens loitering in case they get lit up and I get caught in crossfire. Or getting shot unintentionally while walking past a restaurant, entering the metro, etc. Shootings here in populated areas, carjackings directly increase my feelings of unease much more then simple thefts ever did.

Are you renting? Maybe consider your social needs when seeking your next place after the lease is up, or if the less hectic atmosphere of Brookland is in fact what you want?

I couldn’t go downstairs for sushi anymore or walk a block to my fitness studio. I remember sobbing at one point shortly after our move because I thought I’d made a huge mistake. But honestly, it aligned somewhat with getting older and turning 30, so the bars started feeling less important. And it was great to have a yard for my dog and still have an easy commute. I got used to it pretty quickly. Now I actually live in Brookland here because we were looking for the same—close in with plenty of yard space. I do agree with everyone on the grocery store situation though and will advocate strongly to allow more development along our corridors if the opportunity comes up. I usually drive to the whole foods and trader joes in college park and riverdale which isn’t ideal, but I don’t drive to work so oh well. And for outings do spend a lot of time on MBT, mostly during the day nowadays.

We had a shootout in the hallway. For months we’d been complaining about the stairwell being propped and random people coming and going but they ignored us. 

The story as relayed to me by a neighbor, while we were sitting on the street waiting for the police to finish clearing our floor and collecting evidence:

A local pharmaceutical retailer had his girlfriend rent a unit in the building which he then decked out with food, drinks, tvs and other amenities for his employees. They also lined the walk-in closet with multiple layers of plywood and replaced the closet door so that it could be used to securely store inventory and other supplies. To facilitate easy access to colleagues without keys or fobs they propped the doors and often also left the unit’s door slightly ajar. 

One evening, several employees were enjoying a family meal in the unit. Another employee came from the metro station to deliver inventory and collect the nightly deposit. Unarmed wholesale purchasers followed him up and, temporarily lacking funds, suggested that they take delivery of the just-delivered pharmaceuticals and cash. I’m sure they promised to send over a wire transfer just as soon as their AP department processed the correct forms. 

The delivery guy pulled out a firearm which he then promptly dropped. One of the wholesale purchasers picked up the weapon and promptly shot its owner in the ass for the discourteous behavior. The remainder of the staff then reached for whatever weapons they could find and rushed to empty them in the general direction of the fleeing wholesale buyers. 

The hallway was drenched in blood from the assless guy, who apparently was the only person hit. 

Bozzuto sent a note the next morning that “We were notified of a reported altercation that resulted in one male guest being shot at the property. We are certain you share our concern for this most unfortunate situation. We encourage you to call the police if you have any information related to this incident.” Management skipped the scheduled meeting the next day.",37,2023,9,2,1

My car was broken into (as has every single other car in my building). The ONLY place they do not have cameras is the resident portion of the garage, which I imagine is by design for one reason or another. When I inquired about the cameras, mgmt told me they feel cameras don't do anything to deter crime, and it would be pointless to have them after the car had already been broken into. What? Besides not making a lick of sense, I guess they've never heard of evidence. 

We've also had an issue with folks sleeping, shooting dope, smoking weed, etc. in the stairwells. The lock was broken on most of the stairway doors, but it took forever to be addressed (if it ever was). That, I don't mind as much as the other shit going on, but I do understand how this is a viable safety issue. Also, the fact that mgmt doesn't care, doesn't address it, and looks for new ways to squeeze money from everyone speaks volumes.

I saw someone attempt to steal a running car right in front of Trader Joe's the other night. This was at 8PM ish, when a lot of people were walkinga round and dining a few feet away. Car pulled up, ski mask guy hopped out and hopped in idling car, owner grabbed him, ski mask guy hopped in getaway car, and they blasted through a red light at 4th and Fla. This could have gone downhill fast had a firearm come into the equation.

If you look at MPD reports, there have been a lot of carjackings and armed robberies right around Union Market (and NoMa). Of course, none of the buildings will ever give residents a heads up. They just don't give a fuck. All they care about is jacking up rent and ignoring resident requests.

And while your building management may respond to incidents well, or not well, they are not the root cause of these issues, and complaining to them is not going to make any issues from the surroundings go away. If your building management was perfect, the most they could do is keep it just beyond the property line. It's an error to think they are the cause or the solution. 

These are large, cyclical problems that resist quick solutions. You feel unsafe because you are unsafe. It didn't happen overnight and it's not going to go away overnight.

On the one hand, I’m for giving people second chances and justice reform but this is undoubtedly pushing the boundaries of holding people accountable for the crimes they’ve committed. I think we need to conduct a bit more research prior to going down this road.

You would need to look at a longer period of time to truly assess that.

-If everyone in DC acted like I do (not rape people, not assault people, not kill people) it would be literally *perfectly* safe. It's insane to blame me for a crime wave.    

-Government exists for a reason, and the very initial reason for the founding of government was to protect citizens from violence. They're barely trying. We (with or without consent) have given them a legal monopoly on violence to do so on our behalf to keep the weak, vulnerable and helpless safe. Now that we've given them money, authority, weaponry, and a mandate you're telling me that DC is violent because the people I pay and authorize to protect it are only really window dressing.

See, I've identified your problem.  

The common problem among progressives is that they choose to theorize and attempt to break new ground rather than looking at what.. ya know.. actually *works*. As an example: DCPS is the most expensive per-student school system in the nation. It's also one of the worst. So what do all progressives in DC suggest we do? More of the same. More money! Because when they *think about it* more money should help. They've simulated it in their powerful brains, and they know the outcome. Sure, in 3 generations their super smart kids will still be fighting the same battles, but at least they won't have to admit failure, right? It's like the military industrial complex on steroids, seeing as how we spend *vastly* more on education and social programs than we do on war.  

I see you refused to answer why DC and a few other deep blue cities are the ones experiencing crime waves while all the yokels in those backwards red states are spending less, imprisoning less, policing less and still getting vastly better outcomes. But to the progressive Washingtonian, trying something new that might work, but that also might need to use someone else's old school idea is abhorrent. ""Always forward! Always progress! Always failure as well, but hey! At least we're moving *forward* and trying new things!

*But the simple truth is that, at a minimum, 55 percent of those in state prison have been convicted of a violent crime — and more than half of these people, or nearly 30 percent of the total prison population, have been found guilty of murder, manslaughter, rape or sexual assault, according to the* [*Bureau of Justice Statistics*](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/p17.pdf)*. Slightly less than 15 percent are incarcerated for drug crimes, even though most Americans* [*believe*](https://www.vox.com/2016/9/7/12814504/mass-incarceration-poll) *the figure to be about 50 percent. (Drugs play a bigger role in the federal prison system, but that holds only about 10 percent of all prisoners; most incarcerated people are in state prison.)*

*The share of those in state prison for committing violence is even greater than 55 percent, however. Prisoners are classified by the most serious offense for which they are convicted, not arrested or charged. So if someone is arrested for a violent crime but ends up pleading guilty to a drug charge, his crime is classified as a nonviolent drug offense, even if the underlying incident — like a domestic violence case in which the victim won’t testify — is the reason the prosecutor sought prison time.*",3,2020,11,2,1

100%! I do too!  

I'm not at all against CJR in any way, shape, or form. My bone with the council is that they're spending a lot more time on easing life for 'returning citizens' than they are for the people those same citizens have assaulted, raped and murdered.  

It's not like DC has victims well taken care of. Like I mentioned earlier, I live in a neighborhood that has very recently become rough once again. Rapes, carjacked delivery drivers, etc. I am friends/family with several assault victims. Once the police take their report, they roll out and that's it. One of the victims got a card for a counselor to call. The number went to busy each time it was tried. After spending some time researching it, the victim discovered that DC claims that victims of violent crimes can get their medical bills paid. (in this case a fractured eye socket and broken rib). Guess what? 2 years later and DC is fighting to not pay. And this is a story that I've heard a hundred times.  

So what's the council doing? Passing a bill of rights for victim's of violent crime? Nope! They're trying to reduce sentencing for the small number of people that actually end up serving time. It's fucking ludicrous.  

And in any case, I don't see how any prog can handwave away the awful stats we have. (not that you are). Most of the victims of homicide are black. Most of the victims of rape are women. The crime wave isn't hurting wealthy white men. It's hurting minorities, and when anyone objects to the city's awful leadership everyone pretends they're some gentrifying force and just need to 'deal with' the crime as part of living in a city.

Sadly, all cities have areas that are higher crime vs others, that's why looking at stats for the whole city is informative but can lead you to draw wrong conclusion (ie whole city is violent, vs pockets of violence).

As for comparing a city to a suburb, well sure, you are more likely to be a victim of crime in DC than in a suburb. But that is an odd comparison since more people usually leads to more crime, all else being equal. Someone who is used to rural living might find your sleepy suburb a hot bed of vice and violence.

Finally, it's funny how we normalize certain violence while emphasizing other violence. For example, you are far far more likely to die in a vehicle crash than you are to die being shot during a violent event. In fact, American roads have become far deadlier in the past few years.

2856,h9vl4o4,p90h2e,ncblake,"Nearly 7 year Columbia Heights resident here: This comment section is pretty misleading and one-sided. 

The thing to know is that Columbia Heights is the most dense and most diverse neighborhood in the city. There are young professionals, young families, born-and-raised Black residents, a large Hispanic community, and everything else you can imagine. It’s one of the busier and louder neighborhoods. It has the most convenient transit access in the city. There are Michelin restaurants just blocks away from public housing. You’ll see homelessness and addiction, as well as privilege and luxury living. It’s all here. 

If you’ve lived in a “big city” of any kind, there won’t be much you haven’t seen before. Columbia Heights does rank fairly high in terms of crime data, but it’s largely highly localized violence between individuals who are known to one another. If you’re minding your own business and generally cognizant of your surroundings, it isn’t much more dangerous than any other neighborhood aside from the absolute wealthiest places in the city. 

I’ve always felt that there’s “safety in numbers” in Columbia Heights. Yes, there’s always the risk of being a bystander, but crimes like stick-ups, robberies, etc that target DC’s “professional” crowd tend to be more prevalent in neighborhoods with less foot traffic, in my experience. 

I will say that I don’t think you’ve picked the best blocks in the neighborhood. Neither is “bad” per-se, but you’ll have to cross some of the more infamous blocks to get from those two places to somewhere like the Metro or grocery store. 13th and Clifton, in particular, I wouldn’t recommend for this reason.

I deal with survival sex workers, assault, ODs, the never ending rats the size of small children (hyperbole) and just general jackassness—on the “quiet” street, mind you.

In ten years, my friend (M, Latinx) has been beaten 3 times, robbed once on the corner walking home, bad had his place broken into. 

CH in the past 10 years has *not* gotten better. COVID has really hurt people, but **there were cracks before that thanks to the general buttholeness of the previous admin**. And, compared to northern cities (yeah I lived in West Philly in the 80s, too), there’s a LOT going on, a LOT to navigate. 

We were walking by Coffey before lockdown and a young female (like OPprobably) had her iPhone on the table. Two young kids ran in and grabbed it and were off... These small daily crimes aren’t elevated. 

You can’t even buy toothpaste at CVS without the security guard unlocking the Crest. People are doing whatever they can do to survive like stealing toothpaste.

But, the previous administration forced a lot of Latinx neighborhood people underground. 

“Crime” (and bundling other issues I correctly under that label) happens when people have either no other options or they suck as humans. I’d like to think that most humans don’t suck by choice. 

I know who the survival sex workers are because I see them every day. There is no one on this sub who can say, “hey! She wanted this lifestyle choice!”

I know that “crime” (drug use, B/E, assault) migrates when given the opportunity because I see it at the end of my street off 14th now because the business closed.

The cops are 24/7 on Spring and 14th. They randomly patrol. 
*They know* who and what is happening because they see the same people every day, too. 

Does crime happen because criminals are assholes? Does that mean that there are the most ever assholes in CH?

Naw... crime happens because people don’t have other options. 

Well—except for those freakin crazy evangelicals. They’re just batshit and they have a choice. 

Out of the 20 years I’ve been coming to DC, the past 3 have noticeably gotten worse with a much greater divide in poverty and wealth. 
 
Yeah—all politics are local. I’m from the state that gave us that politico. But, what can *local* do without the power to even control their own fiscal budget when there are generations of systemic racism to overcome?

DC is not a simple solution. I don’t pretend to have any sort of answer and try not to contribute more to the problem anymore than I do by being a white yankee transplant to DC. Laying this insanely complex problem on local government to solve? (And trust me—being on the old Columbia Heights yahoo group was an eye opener on ANC history and how long many community activists have been fighting...)

3049,h9wixvq,p90h2e,129za,"That’s fair enough. But Georgetown isn’t Glover Park. That’s like bringing Adams Morgan into the chat about CH. 

Glover Park is quiet death. It’s beautiful. But it’s not city life as many will recognise. Mount Pleasant and Kalorama have more life in them than GP. And they’re quieter spots. If you’ve come from a place where you expect great restaurants, mixed communities and walkable streets then Ward 1 will be for you. There will be blocks in CH that you won’t want to live on but that’s what happens when you live somewhere without oppressive segregation. The fact is, go to a block that people in this thread think is sketchy and walk two blocks away and you’re somewhere with fantastic restaurants or coffee shops or million dollar homes.

I’ve been harsh on GP and other places like it. If you want a quiet life in the city with trees and great schools and you’re willing to drive then it’s great too.  But what a lot of people seem to buy saying is that poverty scares them (even when side by side with great wealth) and they would like to be able to isolate themselves from that.",1,2021,8,2,1

3059,ha47cuq,p90h2e,CaptainObvious110,"What I wish is that people would stop acting like they are better than those that are not as well off financially as they are or are of a different race than they are.  Every black man is not a thug after all. How do I know? Because I am one of them and certainly do not identify with that lifestyle at all.

Despite Columbia Heights appearing to be melting pot of cultures upon closure look it simply is not the case.  There seems to be a lack of interest in the new white residents in getting to know their new neighborhood and the people who have been there for years.  This air of aloofness is really annoying to me and the insistence on making an area appeal to them rather than integrating into the fabric of the neighborhood is something I call ""the Columbus Effect"" 

Why do I call it that? Well I already answered that in part above.  

Is it wrong to want to live somewhere that you don't have to worry about someone constantly begging you for money? No, not at all.  Is it wrong to not want to live around an open air drug market?  Of course not.

But here's the thing....If people took the time to learn about the neighborhood they intend to move into, then they would already know whether or not that is the neighborhood for them.  As mentioned, it may be that one part of the neighborhood is concerning but another part isn't and that's cool but you won't know if you don't invest a measure of time to understand the people that are already there.

I can speak on this because I have been there and done that.  I took the time to learn and take in the sights at different times and was able to move somewhere that has brought me a lot of happiness instead of misery. I've lived in places where random people would be sitting on the steps and would be in the way when you are trying to enter or leave the apartment building.  

I hate that.

I don't want to be around an area known for drug activity because that brings with it a measure of violence and drama that I want nothing to do with.  

I lived in the Trinidad neighborhood back in the mid 90's and thank goodness I didn't know that many nights what I was hearing was gunshots. I had moved there from NW just to the west of Columbia Heights and so it was definitely a different area than what I was used to.

The fact that an area can change quickly I can attest to because there was a riot in Mt Pleasant back in the early 90's that I didn't find out about until I was an adult even though I was close by.  

Best believe that when I was looking for an apartment I wanted something different. Somewhere I would feel comfortable for my friends and family to be able to walk down the street without being concerned about their safety. 

I get that. 

But what I don't get is the paranoia that has it's root on ignorance and the unwillingness to learn and to grow.",4,2021,8,2,1
