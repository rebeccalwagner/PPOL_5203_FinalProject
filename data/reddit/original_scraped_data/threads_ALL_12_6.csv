2,32cqd6,Recommendations on safe neighborhoods for a young single female to live on her own,"I'm moving to DC from the South in a few weeks. I've previously lived in NYC and Chicago. I'm pretty aware of my surroundings and would think that I can defend myself in most situations. That said, I am petite and would feel like I am an easy target for those that are looking for one, if I happen to be walking alone. I wouldn't walk on my own after dark. I'd likely take a cab or Uber home if it's late and I'm alone, and I carry pepper spray with me at all times.

I have been looking at studios and 1 bedrooms in Eastern Market, though many places that advertise as Eastern Market are really closer to Trinidad which doesn't have a great reputation.

7,1fbmdlr,Room in Glover Park 2bd/2ba,"I am looking for someone to take over my lease in a 2 bed 1 bath apartment in Glover Park starting in the middle of October 2024 (date flexible). The lease term ends in May 2025, but it is open to renewal. Rent is $1075 a month plus utilities (which average around $80-$100 a month, sometimes less). This room is the bigger of the two included in the unit. 

The kitchen in the unit would come mostly furnished, and the common area will be furnished by both you and the current roommate. Most of the items in the room itself (the room with the blue carpet) will not be included. 

A bit more about the space:
The unit is small but cozy, with a full kitchen, living room, and mudroom / storage room / potential sunroom. There’s a newly renovated balcony that is really nice for hosting!
Parking is available for around $100/month, if you have a car. There is also plenty of parking space. 
It is located right next to Glover Park, about a 25 minute walk north from Georgetown.
Trader Joe’s and Safeway are both within easy walking distance.
The space has easy access to the D2, D6, and 33 bus lines. The D2 line takes you to DuPont circle, straight to the red metro line. The 33 line takes you from Friendship Heights to the national Mall area.
The neighborhood is super friendly and very walkable. I often go on walks later in the evening and always feel safe.
The landlady is nice and responsive to maintenance requests.

The current roommate is a guy in his mid-20s, working in consulting.

What we’re looking for: 
A working professional in mid to late 20’s. 
Preferably no pets. 
Someone who values cleanliness, communication, and a respect for private spaces/time. 

If any of this sounds of interest, let me know! We can set up an in-person or remote tour.

8,1dljgkt,"Bedroom in prime Columbia Heights rowhouse, $1075 per month starting August 1st","Hello!

I’m moving away from DC to do a Fulbright and am looking for a sublease/lease takeover for my bedroom in a lovely rowhouse right in the center of Columbia Heights.

This is a three-bedroom rowhouse with one full bathroom upstairs and one half bathroom downstairs. My room is the middle room, but still a great size. It has one nice north-facing window which looks out onto the backyard and the next street and gets good light. The window sits in front of a nook, which is where I have my desk, though you could also easily rearrange things. The rest of the room is rectangular, with hardwood flooring, and also has a huge walk-in closet with built-in shelves and racks for hanging clothes on both sides, as well as plenty of space for extra storage. There are plenty of outlets for extra lamps in addition to the overhead light.

Upstairs alongside the other two bedrooms, the bathroom has nice tile floors, a full tub with a huge flat fixed showerhead and removable showerhead, and a modern wood vanity and large mirror. The bathroom also has a huge skylight which gives it great natural light throughout the day. In the upstairs hallway, there is another nook for the modern washing machine and dryer, along with an even bigger skylight for natural light. The hardwood floors also continue throughout, including downstairs in the spacious entrance hallway, living room, and dining room.

My favorite part of the house is the kitchen, which has a gas stove, great counter space, a massive island, tons of cabinets and drawers for storage, and modern refrigerator, microwave, dishwasher, and other small appliances. The kitchen looks out into the backyard through a wide sliding screened window and glass door. The backyard itself is a good size and fenced in, with tables both on the balcony and below (though we’re in the process of cleaning in the pictures).

The house is old but in good shape. It’s owned by a private landlord, a family with kids who used to live here as their personal residence before they moved to another neighborhood in DC. The dad still handles all the maintenance and is generally very responsive. The other roommates are two young professionals in their late twenties (both men), one an embassy employee and the other a software developer. Both are very nice and easy to get along with!

The house is located on Monroe Street in Columbia Heights, on a very quiet and safe street with lots of families. It’s just around the corner from Columbia Heights Plaza and all the amenities there: a 3 minute walk to the Columbia Heights metro station on the Green Line, 2 minutes to three different grocery stores (Target, Giant, and Lidl), and also surrounded by lots of great restaurants. It’s also about a 7 minute walk to the heart of Mount Pleasant.

I’m looking to sublease my room starting August 1. My lease runs until September 30, so a 2-month term and it’s for $1,075 per month + utilities. You would almost certainly have the option to sign a full 1-year lease following the sublease and starting October 1 if you wanted. The landlord would also likely be willing to start a 1-year lease on August 1 if you’d prefer, as each of the bedrooms is on a separate lease and term.

Let me know if you’re interested and would like to tour in-person or virtually! You’d then meet the roommates and would have to do a quick check with the landlord. And I’m happy to answer any other questions you might have.

9,1cvsvu4,Lease takeover - own bedroom and bathroom in 2bd/2ba apartment right next to the red line - $1630 per month. Free rent in June.,"\*\*Key details\*\* 

This is 1 bedroom and 1 bathroom in a shared 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom apartment. Your share of the rent would be $1630 a month + utilities (which are usually around $60 a month including internet). Available for move in anytime between now and start of July. June is also FREE if moving in after the 4th. This is a lease takeover, with the lease lasting until May 4th 2025. 

\*\*About the apartment\*\* 

Modern apartment with 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. Your bathroom isn't en-suite but is about 1 yard from your bedroom door. Bedroom is spacious with comfortably enough room for a queen bed and furniture. There's also a built in closet. There is a washer/dryer in unit, dishwasher and central AC and heating. The apartment also has a balcony overlooking the courtyard. 

\*\*About the building\*\* 

Wisconsin Place is the best place I've ever lived. Very modern building, with great amenities including: in-building gym with new equipment, a cinema room, a cafe area with Macs, a rooftop pool and a business center with free printing. All are free to use for residents. The 24 hour reception is also super useful for making sure your packages and things are super safe. The building has an attached parking garage which it shares with a Whole Foods and Friendship Heights metro station. That means you are incredibly close to the metro and on humid/rainy days you don't even have to go outside to catch the red line downtown. The building has a 4.8 rating on Google, which is amazing for an apartment building, and honestly, I'd say that's accurate. 

\*\*The roommate\*\* 

Jason, my roommate, is staying on in the other room. He's great and one of the best roommates I've had. In his late 20s, works at a local university while also doing his master's there. You'll also be living with his labradoodle who is incredibly friendly and always down for sofa pets. 

\*\*Why I'm leaving\*\* 

My fiancee lives in Philly, and my work only requires me be in person Tue-Thu. So I'm only in town for at max two nights a week. The apartment is great, but I was never there. So moving somewhere that's more a \*bed and nothing else\*

11,17ed6rg,DC lease signing from afar - doing my due diligence [DC],"Greetings,

I'm a single female in my mid-thirties, relocating to DC for work from overseas. I find myself on a rather tight timeline to secure housing (most likely a studio), within the monthly price range of $1600 to $2300. Despite dedicating over a hundred hours to research, I'm aware that cities like DC are constantly evolving, rendering some of the information I've gathered outdated.

With that in mind, I kindly seek your advice as a local. Could you please recommend 1 to 2 neighborhoods or sub-neighborhoods that I should consider? I am particularly interested in areas with a community feel, that offer close proximity and easy access to safe parks and nature trails, efficient public transit to downtown, and quality grocery stores.

While I don't particularly enjoy clubbing, bar hopping, or loud neighbors at night, I do appreciate being able to walk home (relatively) safely after dark and attend the occasional intimate music or cultural performance in my neighborhood.

I am open to nearby suburbs in Virginia and Maryland as well. Your insights would be immensely valuable, and I am genuinely appreciative of your time and guidance.",2023,10,0,0

Landlord is great and very responsive/flexible too and he and his family live right down the same street! 

About your roommates: 

Names are Rick and William. I’ve lived with the same roommates for 2+ years and they are solid guys; we all got along very well with each other. I have been living with them for over two years and enjoyed their company--even during COVID! We were all fairly on the quieter side. Both were very trustworthy, responsible, and respectable when it came to living together. They were certainly very solid roommates during a period where we all needed to work together to stay safe from COVID.

28,qty2ur,$700 / 1br - Unbeatable $700/month (1 bd/shared bath) in shared 3 bd/2 bth townhome,"&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Amazing access, very safe, and walking distance (<15 min. away) to Braddock/King St. metro (blue/yellow), groceries, commuter bike trail, and historic Old Town. On-site parking.  


This is a 3-bedroom 2 bath townhome shared with two roommates-- Rick and William!  


Looking for someone who can take tenancy starting January 9th or sometime soon thereafter.  


**Details:**  


**Rent:** $700/month (averaging the past 12 months of utility and internet cost comes out to an additional $110/month for a total all-in average cost of $810/month)  


Room is unfurnished, but let me know what you’re looking for and I might be able to let go of some things for free or for a nominal cost  


**Security Deposit:** $700 (pet-friendly with an additional $150 security deposit)  


**Room details:** two-windowed corner-room; very well lit; room is \~150 sq ft room, shared bathroom, additional arts/hobby room next door and adjacent down the hall  


Central air conditioning and heating  


On-site parking in driveway  


Spacious backyard  


On-premise parking  


Shared kitchen appliances  


**Lease details:** 1 year lease, but if you need to leave early, Alan (the landlord) can sign a new lease with your replacement so you'd never need to worry with the stress of dealing with a subtenant or exit penalty.  


**Additional info:**  


I've rented in Alexandria for 5+ years and this is one of the best finds out there in my cumulative experience--significantly under present rates today (which run close to $1,000 shared, or $1,700 for a studio), well-maintained, courteous roommates, nestled in a quiet Del Ray neighborhood and very safe at all hours of the day/night. Landlord is great and very responsive/flexible too and he and his family live right down the same street!  


**About your roommates:**  


Names are Rick and William. I’ve lived with the same roommates for 2+ years and they are solid guys; we all got along very well with each other. I have been living with them for over two years and enjoyed their company--even during COVID! We were all fairly on the quieter side. Both were very trustworthy, responsible, and respectable when it came to living together. They were certainly very solid roommates during a period where we all needed to work together to stay safe from COVID.

I love to cook and bake (but always clean up after myself) and would love to connect with my roommate(s) over a meal or baked good.

If anyone is looking to move closer to Georgetown, Rosslyn, Courthouse area my apartment is available for rent. It takes two minutes to drive to Georgetown and is about a 5 minute walk to Courthouse area. I walk my dog everyday up to Clarendon and that takes less than 15 minutes.

I know it says 1 parking spot but its actually 2 and a private parking lot included. If no parking in the lot is available (which it always is) you are given a pass to park on the street. The zoning extends all the way up into Clarendon and Ballston so you can park up there for free as well. My electric usually runs about 40 dollars a month. Since its only 9 units its a really safe community and everyone knows each other.

My girlfriend and I are hopefully moving to D.C. post-graduation and thus far, we're not having much luck finding a place to live. She starts her job in Alexandria May 26th and would really like to be settled around May 18th.

I'll most likely be working around Dupont, but I also have a car while she has to take a metro so I'm willing to drive a bit further if necessary. But for us, price is the biggest deal-breaker.

I have a bunch of student loans so I'd prefer to keep the cost of those and rent low enough to be able to have money for groceries at the end of the month, too.

She *really* wants to feel safe in her neighborhood, as well. She's also really big on in-room/building washer-dryer units and a dishwasher.

Bedrooms: 4Bathrooms: 2.5

Rent: $1050

Deposit: $1050

Utilities: Usually mostly covered by basement apartment credit (Average without is $85 a month)

Lease term: 1 year

Washer/Dryer: in house

Distance to metro: <5 minute walk.

Credit/Background Check: Required by Landlord ($35 fee)

3 rooms will be available on November 1st, 2019 in a 4 Bed 3 Bath row house just off Georgia Avenue. The house sits just a short 5 minute walk away from the Georgia Ave-Petworth Station. Safeway, CVS, and the great food options Georgia Avenue has to offer are all a short walk away. The neighborhood is very quiet, pleasant and safe.

The house is three floors. The top two floors both have two bedrooms and a bathroom with the bottom floor being a shared spaced containing the living room, kitchen, a small bathroom, and a small sun room. Both rooms on the second floor and one room on the third floor are available. The south facing second floor room comes with its own private sun room. The house is also PoC and LGBTQ+ friendly.

The house works on a group lease with each person paying 1/4th of the rent each month. Rent for the next lease will be 1050 each. The house has a (recently vacated but hopefully filled soon) separate basement apartment which shares a backyard with us. The city sends a credit for this apartment which usually covers most or all of the utilities for the month. 

I'm ideally looking for 3 other responsible young professionals who would be willing to sign a 1 year lease with me for the house. The landlord requires an application process which costs $35 to do a credit and background check. The first month's rent and the security deposit will be due on November 1st. Unfortunately due to the group lease the start date of the lease is not flexible.

50,4x8h7d,Looking for 2 roommates in NW DC. Iowa ave and 14th. HUGE house!,"http://washingtondc.craigslist.org/mld/roo/5724929280.html

Hi there! We are a couple looking for 2 roommates to share a house that we are renting in DC starting on the first of October. We are both professionals with full time careers and we are looking for the same in roommates. We have lived together for 2 years now and are coming from a very successful living situation in Silver Spring where we had 2 other people in a nice house, we are just looking to move into the city. We are 25-30 and are looking for roommates in the same general age range =)

The neighborhood is pretty amazing. Its a small walk to the metro or a straight shot on the bus, it wouldn't take more than 15 minutes to get to the metro. There is street parking available, and from what we saw, it wasn't ridiculously crowded. We were able to easily find spots each time we went by the house. Bottom line is that the neighborhood felt safe and definitely isn't ghetto. Also, Rock Creek Park is literally within seeing distance. You cross 2 streets and you are in the park on amazing running/hiking trails and the tennis center is right there as well.

There are 2 rooms and an Au Pair suite available for rent. The 2 rooms are joined (normal for a house this old, built in 1908! Dont worry, its been updated =P), but there is a door that can be locked. They are HUGE rooms, and if someone wanted both, that could possibly be worked out. The rooms could potentially share a bathroom, but if one person took both they would have a private bathroom. The suite, however, is completely self sufficient containing a kitchenette and private bathroom and is located on the top floor. All of the these spaces can easily accommodate large beds with multiple pieces of furniture and still feel roomy. 

We asked about utilities and were told that its about 200 for electric in the summer and about 200 for gas in the winter (depending on usage of course), so nothing crazy. All utilities are split evenly amongst the roommates. Internet is 150/150Mb download/upload speed, so even if everyone is streaming, it won't be an issue. If anyone wants additional services like TV or home phone, that would be paid by the people interested in those services. We don't want TV, so would not be paying a portion of the TV part of the bill. Obviously others in the house might want TV so you could all split that part of the bill. Also, I do IT for a living, so our networking and wireless will be top notch. You don't have to worry about slow downloads or poor quality while streaming netflix =D

There is a great backyard with a great deck for entertaining. It really is a rare thing to find a yard this nice in the city. There are many flower beds and we encourage people to use them if they so desire =) We will be growing seasonal veggies! There is a nice grill that is available for everyone to use as well as deck furniture. 

There is a pretty big basement for storage and also a garage that a few things can be stored in. We will have our cars in the garage, so space may be limited, but if there is room, we can work it out =)

We are looking for roommates who can pay their rent on time, be courteous to all who live there, and be moderately neat. We are not looking for OCD clean, but if you could not leave your dishes in the sink in an attempt to grow mini civilizations of life forms that'd be great.

Finally, there are 2 adorable dogs that live with us but sadly we are not looking for another. Perfect if you are a dog person who just doesn't have their puppy to love. Bella is a trained service dog (I trained dogs in the Army) and Bentley is a puppy that I was fostering and decided to keep.
We are open to male, female, and are LGBT friendly (Its crazy that I even need to say this).

60,4msa0g,Man and his cat looking to move to NW DC July 1,"My roommate's headed back to North Carolina July 1 and after realizing I spend more than $100 on cabs and Ubers to and from NW DC per month, I figure it's time to be where my friends are, preferably in Petworth or CoHi, but anywhere NW DC will do! In the past 2 weeks I've discovered that Craigslist is like 80% scammers at this point and in the past 2 hours I've discovered that there alternatives to Craigslist! Cool!

I'm 31 and have been in DC for 7 years. I work as a copy editor and social media liaison for a nonprofit in Rockville, MD.

I enjoy hanging out with my friends, watching dumb movies, and making cocktails.I keep shared living spaces clean and very much as I left them. I'm positive to a fault, very friendly, and outgoing to a point, though there are some days when I'll be most interested in recharging at home, due to my conflicting introverted and extroverted tendencies.

I have a friendly, lazy, spry 14-year-old cat who would be making the move with me. She has no health issues and, though it would not have been my choice, my mom had her declawed as a kitten, so furniture is safe around her. She's very attached to me but has warmed up to others since living with roommates!

I'm looking to find a place that is safe, affordable and allows me to get around easily on foot or with public transportation, especially to Foggy Bottom. Nova is fine so long as it doesn't feel too suburban - I need to feel like I am living in a city. 


About me: Quiet but with a sense of humor. I don't drink or smoke. I rarely have people over because I'd rather catch up with friends over coffee or dinner at a restaurant. If I am sharing an apartment, I'd prefer a roommate who feels the same - I've lived with people who constantly have people over and that is so not for me. I'm very considerate and need to have a roommate who is the same way.  

  
The cat? She's very relaxed, just eats and sleeps and is very friendly. However, I'm noticing that a lot of rentals in DC say ""no pets,"" so I'm putting it front and center that the cat comes with.  


I'm looking to move in mid-August. Early, I know, but I figured it couldn't hurt to start looking now.

73,1ieety,Some questions about finding housing in D.C.,"Hey y'all
I plan to move to D.C. in the next few weeks for graduate school and have come across some strange details in classified postings that leave me baffled. I'm currently living in the South but am by no means a Southern hick; I'm curious as to why some of the housing opportunities are so restrictive.

Why is it that there are so many people who will only accept gay (or specifically, black gay) room mates? I've come across so many ads specifically limiting housing to non-straight males. I've never seen that before.

Along with that, I don't smoke but I've seen countless ads requesting Non-Smokers only. Is smoking indoors a huge problem in D.C.? It seems strange to me that folks would be so explicit about something like that. Where I'm from, people tend to keep their bad habits outdoors where it won't bother anybody.

Rent prices. I am honestly curious how people can afford $1200/mo rent for apartments in ""transition"" neighborhoods. I'm looking to settle into a $700/mo shoebox in Petworth because that is the absolute max i can afford but are jobs just so lucrative in our nations capital that +$1000 is nothing? 

Crime. The crime maps suggest that having your car broken into and being mugged are not uncommon. Why is this? What can you do (aside from don't attract attention to yourself) to avoid being a victim? I'm genuinely curious.

Where do all the house shows happen? I haven't found many basements in my search. Are basement shows a thing in D.C.?

Thanks for taking the time for reading this.",2013,7,0,0
74,50hbec,Looking for 2 roommates for house share in Silver Spring (inside beltway),"http://washingtondc.craigslist.org/mld/roo/5759227402.html

Hi there! We are a couple looking for a 3rd and 4th roommate. We are both professionals who have full time careers and have been living together for 2 years now. Our current roommates have decided to move out so we have a couple of rooms available. We are aged 25-31 and looking for a roommate in the same general age range =)

We are located in a quiet neighborhood with lots of running/biking trails within walking distance. There has been no crime since we have lived here. There are no cars on blocks and no bars on windows. It's a great little place to live.

The rooms for rent are upstairs and would share a large bathroom. The first one has a HUGE walk in closet with lots of closet hardware for easy storage. This room is approximately 17x12 and has plenty of room for your furniture and can easily fit a king size bed, although I have found that a queen is the best fit. This room is going for 850 a month

The other room is slightly smaller at 15x11 and has 2 huge closets on one wall. The bed in the picture is a queen for reference. There is also a desk in the room as well as a night stand on the other side of the bed. This room is going for 800 a month. 

These rooms would share the bathroom pictured, however it is a LARGE bathroom with lots of storage including separate storage on either side of the sink and a large closet. 

The utilities (water and electric) are about 300~ a month, depending on usage and will be split evenly among the 4 tenants. Internet is 99 a month (to be split amongst everyone) for 150/150Mb download/upload speed, so even if everyone is streaming, it won't be an issue. If anyone wants additional services like TV or home phone, that would be paid by the people interested in those services. I don't want TV, so would not be paying a portion of the TV part of the bill. Obviously others in the house might want TV so you could all split that part of the bill.

The house has a great backyard with a brand new deck, perfect for BBQ's and just hanging out. The house is also fully wired for networking, so no one has to go with ""just"" Wi-Fi, although our Wi-Fi is awesome because that's what I do for a living, and I only use the best equipment. The kitchen is HUGE with lots of counter space and LOTS of storage, so everyone should have room for their stuff. 
There is plenty of street parking and its within (on the longer side) walking distance to Forest Glen Metro. There are also bus stops all around the neighborhood. 

We are looking for roommates who can pay their rent on time, be courteous to all who live there, and be moderately neat. We aren't looking for OCD clean, but if you could not leave your dishes in the sink in an attempt to grow mini civilizations of life forms that'd be great.

Finally, there are 2 adorable dogs that live with us but sadly we are not looking for another. Perfect if you are a dog person who just doesn't have their puppy to love. Bella is a trained service dog (I trained dogs in the Army) and Bentley is a puppy that I was fostering and decided to keep.

75,4z0owk,Looking for 2 roommates for house share in Silver Spring (inside the beltway),"Hi there! We are a couple looking for a 3rd and 4th roommate. We are both professionals who have full time careers and have been living together for 2 years now. Our current roommates have decided to move out so we have a couple of rooms available. We are aged 25-31 and looking for a roommate in the same general age range =)

We are located in a quiet neighborhood with lots of running/biking trails within walking distance. There has been no crime since we have lived here. There are no cars on blocks and no bars on windows. It's a great little place to live.

The rooms for rent are upstairs and would share a large bathroom. The first one has a HUGE walk in closet with lots of closet hardware for easy storage. This room is approximately 17x12 and has plenty of room for your furniture and can easily fit a king size bed, although I have found that a queen is the best fit. This room is going for 900 a month

The other room is slightly smaller at 15x11 and has 2 huge closets on one wall. The bed in the picture is a queen for reference. There is also a desk in the room as well as a night stand on the other side of the bed. This room is going for 850 a month. 

These rooms would share the bathroom pictured, however it is a LARGE bathroom with lots of storage including separate storage on either side of the sink and a large closet. 

The utilities (water and electric) are about 300~ a month, depending on usage and will be split evenly among the 4 tenants. Internet is 99 a month (to be split amongst everyone) for 150/150Mb download/upload speed, so even if everyone is steaming, it won't be an issue. If anyone wants additional services like TV or home phone, that would be paid by the people interested in those services. I don't want TV, so would not be paying a portion of the TV part of the bill.

79,3cgi4y,"1 BR Available in Brookland house, Blocks from Red Line and Catholic University, Aug 1st $1100 + utilities","*Note: Please PM me if interested. Check out the CL post for pics: https://washingtondc.craigslist.org/doc/roo/5108681428.html*

The room:

The enormous master bedroom is essentially two rooms, a larger L-shaped space (currently used as a home office/yoga spot/extra couch space) and a sun room. The sunroom has a huge closet with full length mirrors, and enough space for a large bed. Ceiling fans in both rooms make the summer months more pleasant, and the rooms get lots of light.

The rooms are at the back of the house, so noise from the street, living room, and front porch generally doesn't carry.

Rent is $1100 not including utilities or internet.

The house:

The second floor includes the master bedroom, a smaller bedroom, and a spacious bathroom with a jacuzzi.

The first floor has a living room (complete with TV, couch, heated table for the winter months, and decorative fireplace), dining room, bedroom with half-bath, and kitchen. The kitchen has marble countertops, a gas stove, and a dishwasher. We have lots of shared spices and kitchen equipment.

The basement has a bedroom, another full bath, and a washer/dryer. There is also some storage space, currently used for suitcases. If you are a bicyclist, there is plenty of room for another bike in the house.

The backyard is mostly gravel, which makes maintenance fairly easy. There are two grills and a table, great for barbeques or morning coffee. It is fenced and secure.

The front porch includes more seating and a small herb garden.

The neighborhood:

This house is located about a half mile from the Brookland-Catholic University Metro Station. It is just off Monroe, which is one of the main roads of the neighborhood, but it is a very quiet street with lots of parking space.

The metro is five blocks away, a 10 minute brisk walk or a 15 minute stroll. For those attending Catholic University, it should be about a 15 minute walk to get to the edge of campus from this location.

Our home is close to the restaurants on 12th Street, which has a CVS, Capital Bikeshare, a post office, a hardware store, and many restaurants such as Menomale, Brookland Pint, Brookland's Finest, and Steel Plate. We have a couple of great local breakfast places/cafes (Murray and Paul's, Askale Cafe) as well as Z Pizza, Potbelly's, and Busboy and Poets. For those who like to run, swim, lift weights, play basketball/baseball, and more, Turkey Thicket Recreation Center is right next to the metro station.

Yes Organic is about a 20-minute walk. Giant, the nearest full sized grocery store, is at the Rhode Island Ave Metro, which is about a 25 minute walk or a 10 minute bike ride.

There are many transportation options to every part of the DC area. Brookland is on the red line, which takes you directly downtown or up towards Silver Spring. It is also one stop away from Ft. Totten, which connects to the yellow and green line. Bus lines also connect you to downtown DC, Tenleytown in NW DC, PG Plaza in Maryland, and more.

Your roommates:

Roommate number one works as a librarian in DC and specializes in multimedia education, audio storytelling, and community engagement. She is the proud owner of the house's curious cat, and she enjoys binge watching Frazier, Bob's Burgers, and the Simpsons. The house smells divine whenever she's cooking anything.

Roommate number two works in the restaurant industry at night and does freelance videography and video editing. He likes to play guitar, watch movies, drink coffee, and bother the cat. He often bakes bread in the noisy bread machine, and he drinks a beer with the cat to relax.

Roommate number three moved to this home from an urban kibbutz of sorts. She is a daytime government worker and nighttime master's student, so she spends a lot of time studying. Actually, some of the ""studying"" time is spent reading crime fiction, and some of it is spent watching Foyle's War, but a bit is legit studying! She also enjoys playing guitar, going for walks, and eating delicious bread from the bread machine. Roommates two and three are a couple.

Generally speaking, we are a quiet house, and we keep noise and activity down after about 10 pm. In order to economize, we try to keep the house cool in the winter and warm in the summer.

Languages spoken in the household: English, Russian, Spanish, Chinese, Japanese.

Seeking:

Looking for a clean and courteous roommate. We are looking for a non-smoker, and we have a policy of no drug use in our home.

Under our lease terms, we are only able to accept one person, and we are not able to accept any more pets. Our fat cat is very friendly and loves to snuggle, but he'll also keep away from you if you're not a cat person. The basement is a cat-free zone. If you don't want Mr. Cat in your room, just keep the door closed. He has not been in the master bedroom, so it is currently cat-free.

The three of us all cook frequently, but we're generally great about sharing kitchen space and pretty finicky about keeping it clean. You'd be welcome to cook all the time, and even join our awesome CSA. If you'd rather not cook at all, that's also ok.

House responsibilities are fairly standard. We have some yard maintenance (pretty seasonal) and help each other keep the house clean. In our house, we have a monthly house meeting/meal to discuss little things that come up, to organize house cleaning and maintenance, and get the utility bills properly divided. A couple of us are open to sharing more food/cooking than we currently do if that's something that might interest you. ",2015,7,0,0

Really great deal, the best I could find in the area.

* Shared laundry in a basement (at least it's on site?) 
* Sometimes can hear people upstairs (1st floor apartment)
* Older building
* No counter space in the kitchen, but it's more than large enough to have a kitchen island and a kitchen table. 
* Small bathroom

Positives:

* High ceilings with large, bright windows
* Friendly neighbors
* Real hardwood floors
* Large rooms (besides bathroom)
* Quiet street
* Well maintained - didn't have a single issue upon move in
* No bars over the windows even though it's a 1st floor due to how raised it is off the ground level
* Older building (some people like older, some don't)
* Block away from the metro and all the restaurants on Connecticut

84,33vo9m,Looking for a room in DC? How about one on the Red Line for $850/month,"Available May 12, flexible to May 7:
We’re seeking someone or someone(s) to take over our wonderful space in the Connecticut Heights Apartments. This room is ideal for one or two summer interns looking to move in Mid-May (flexible even from May 7) and looking to stay until the end of July. This corner room has two big windows facing west and north, comfortable fits two twin beds and large furniture, like a desk, dresser, side tables, etc. The full bath you would share with your immediate roommate is right outside the bedroom door, and our other roommate has her own private bath . We are also willing to sell one twin bed, almost brand new, for $150 OBO, bedding for the said twin bed, an incredible futon for $175, and a 50” HD TV for $300. 
The apartment is carpeted, has a huge (emphasis on huge)  bright kitchen, especially considering the historic nature of our beautiful building. You have a closet in your room and additional storage in the foyer. The apartment is right across the street from a church and church-run preschool. The neighborhood is safe and quiet, but still only a block and a half from Connecticut Ave and all the amenities it offers. M4 and L2 buses run two blocks away, and Van Ness UDC and Tenleytown metro stations are only a half mile away. 
We are willing to pro-rate the rent up until your move-in date, and we’ll even share the application fee ($350) with whoever moves in to help bear the brunt of the burden—split four ways for two roomies, and 3 ways for one. Remaining roommate is 420 friendly (however will not partake if you request her not to) and very chill, writer and enjoys going out on the weekends. The lease ends at the end of July, but you can resign for the room ($1250 for one person, $625 for two), if you decide you want to stay inside the beltway.
Utilities run about $50 a month, which is split either two or three ways. Cable and internet—including HBO and On Demand—runs $112 a month, which will also be split either two or three ways . 
There is parking, but we aren’t quite sure about fees because we just love walking around our beautiful neighborhood.
Apartment Amenities:
 Air Conditioning, Capital Bikeshare, Indoor and Outdoor swimming pool, tennis court, 24-hour concierge, 24-hour fitness center, key fob access, laundry facilities on each floor, package service, valet dry cleaning service, free wifi in lobby. 
If interested, please share a bit about yourself, what you will be doing in DC, and any questions.

85,277mku,"3 rooms for rent in Burke townhouse. $630.00,$465.00 and $390.00 + utilities. Available July 1st.","Hey!

I am looking to fill 3 rooms in the townhouse I am currently renting in Burke, VA. My roommates have found jobs in other areas and are moving out, but I really like it here and would like to stay! The rooms vary by size and the rent reflects that. 

Room 1: Basement ($630) - huge room. Has a private half-bathroom and a full fridge. The full-bathroom located on the 2nd floor is also available for you to use. Direct access to laundry and dryer units, which are shared with other housemates. Not the typical basement room -- plenty of natural sunlight, as there is a sliding door leading to the patio and backyard (could even be used as a private entrance). 

Room 2: Standard ($465) - Located on the 2nd floor. Shared full bathroom (also on 2nd floor) with 2 housemates and shared half bathroom (on 1st floor). Has a window and a standard-sized closet. Can fit a full or queen-sized bed. 

Room 3: Small ($390) - Although the room is small, it comes furnished with a full-sized bed, pillows, and comforter set (can all be removed if you don't want it), and a lamp. Has room for a small computer table and a dresser. Has a window and a small closet. 

More about me: I am a 28 year old male. I work in the mortgage industry out in Tyson's Corner. I like spending time outdoors, playing Xbox, reading, and watching Netflix. Really easy-going and low maintenance housemate. 

More about the area: Quiet, safe neighborhood located 20 minutes outside of DC. Plenty of parking right outside the townhouse. Cats are welcome! Lots of young professionals and families in the neighborhood. Access to community pool, tennis courts, and basketball courts. Close to GMU, I-495, VRE bus, and several Metro stations. 

I think that's about it -- let me know if you have any questions! I'm available to show the rooms this upcoming weekend, need commitment by June 10th for July 1st move-in. May be able to negotiate an earlier move-in.

I've been at this house for a year and am renewing and my boyfriend is moving in, so we will be taking up 2 of the 4 bedrooms and we have 2 bedrooms open. It's been a group house for a long time so it's not sparkling new but it's got charm, is sunny and spacious, and an 8 minute walk to the takoma metro/20 mins to downtown. One bedroom connects to the (unfinished) attic, both have a/c and look out over the front yard and have high ceilings and lots of natural light. 

pros:
-friendly roomies who cook constantly (seriously, my boyfriend is a chef. we always have tons of food cooking or in the fridge and love to cook for others!)
-lots of natural light
-hardwood floors
-close to metro
-front and back porch. back patio looks over a 2 car driveway
-we also sublet out the basement occasionally for $400 so that knocks a hundred off our rent
-420 and booze friendly, no smoke in the house though
-we are pretty nerdy types (game of thrones sundays are a must, and I have a harry potter tattoo) but also love the outdoors and going to live sports games. 

cons:
-no central air or heat :( we do have a/c in the bedrooms for rent and tons of fans and space heaters and it hasn't been a problem for me
-like I said, it's been a group house for a while so the house isn't brand new but the landlady is painting the house before y'all would move in 

not sure if pro or con:
-I do have a cat that hates other animals with the fire of a thousand suns, so unfortunately no other four legged critters can be welcome but he is super friendly and awesome.
-we work in the restaurant industry so we tend to get home/stay up late but are quiet and respectful of others' bedtimes!

The landlady lives in NYC but is friendly and on top of getting things fixed. she does a credit/job check and requires a sec deposit and first month's rent.

Takoma is a great little town on the dc/md border, there's tons of cute little shops and a farmer's market. We're a ten minute walk from the Safeway and the Quarry House (great bar in Silver Spring) is half a mile walk away. Super safe and friendly neighborhood.

utilities not included, usually about 70-120 depending on the season. Year leases only. ",2013,8,0,0
88,24xg4f,Large Private Bedroom/Bath Available in Artsy 2br/2ba Row Home Apartment,"**Room**

In the shared apartment, situated in a prime Adams Morgan location, I have available to rent a large bedroom with a private hallway, private bath with a deep tub and wall mirror, porch and back entrance. The room will come unfurnished, but it is large enough to fit a queen or king sized bed with plenty of room to spare. French doors give the room a unique feel and offer the space plenty of light.


**Communal Space**

The living room and dining area is lovely large space with high ceilings - big bay windows, working fireplace and an exposed brick wall. The space is mostly furnished, but I would love to discuss more as there is room. All the floors of the apartment are wooden. I have a large vinyl record and book collection I would be happy to share and my artwork does cover the walls (and some floor space!) The kitchen comes stocked but there will be room for your items. Garbage disposal and dishwasher. Included is a washer/dryer in unit and central air. Plenty of storage space available as well.

**Utilities**

Included in rent is water and trash. Not included is electric and wifi, which I pay directly monthly and we will split. I do not have a television set, so there is currently no cable - but this could certainly be changed if you were interested.  


**The Neighborhood**	

The apartment is located in the heart of Adams Morgan, perfectly comfortable for a night in and even better situated for a night out - located a block away from the 18th street strip. A reason I love this apartment is because it's not centrally located in the noise and fuss of the main area of AdMo, but so close that everything is easily accessible by foot. Safe neighborhood with some gems close by - Tryst, the coffee shop/bar I can be found at after work (one of the highest rated in the city!), Idle time Books (a treasure of a used bookstore), the beautiful Meridian Hill Park and tons of the best boutiques, bars, yoga and restaurants in DC. There is a 24/7 Safeway and a Yes! Organic Market right up the street as well as a Harris Teeter. Next door to the famous Adams Morgan dog, Romo. You will also be about a short walk away from Woodley Park and the National Zoo, Dupont Circle, U St and Columbia Heights.

**Getting Around**

The red line metro is an 8 minute walk away at the Woodley Park Metro, and Dupont Circle metro is also walk or bus accessible. The green/yellow line is also easily accessible by walking or bus at the Columbia Heights Metro. The L2, 90, 96 and the Circulator bus stop is situated right in front of our door! Around the corner you can catch the 42 and the 43. Also, right across the street is a capital bikeshare station from where you can rent bikes. This is one of the most well connected streets in the area.

**About Me**	

You will be sharing the apartment with me, a 28 year old female originally from Brooklyn NY. I have lived in the apartment for almost 3 years and it is my home. I am a property manager for a subsidized apartment building /soup kitchen for low income senior citizens and I also am a freelance artist. I am looking for someone in their late 20s-early 30s, non-smoker, lgbt friendly, who doesn't like to party in house but the occasional dinner party and brunch is great, semi decently clean (hell, I am not perfect) and who must be okay with me doing my art in the apartment. I would like someone who would want to make it a home as well.

**Available June 1st.**

It's five blocks from the Stadium-Armory metro, eight blocks from H St NE, and eight blocks from RFK Stadium. The neighborhood is very safe and respectful, and I have thoroughly enjoyed the last year I've lived here.

About me: I am a twenty-four year old male who works at a restaurant down by the Navy Yard. My free time generally involves going to DC United games (season ticket holder), going out to concerts, or going to H St for drinks.

About you: You should be of a similar level in the game of life. As long as you are clean and you can pay the rent on time then we will probably get along fine. Currently my working hours are generally 4 to close so if you have a F/T job then we would be at the house at different times of the day anyways.

The rooms are $800 each per month plus utilities, which would probably be another $75-90. A security deposit of $800 is also expected up front by my landlord as well. Pets are currently a no-go. Smokers are fine as long as they do it away from the house. A family with two young children live on the second floor and I don't want to upset them over stupid stuff like that. There are two off-street parking spaces in the back so you don't have to worry about street parking. If you do get your car registered in DC, it's Zone 6 parking, which is massive. It goes all the way from north of the Verizon Center all the way down to Southwest/Nats Park. The little things. 

I'm currently showing the house on Saturday (the 10th) from 12 to around 4-ish. If you are interested in coming at a specific time just e-mail me and I will see what's available time-wise. I am working tonight so if you don't get a response immediately, that's why. People coming in pairs will be given priority.

Talk to you all soon. -- Kevin

Yet today we see the attemped lynching of a southeast Asian Man in the streets of DC, simply for the crime of recording people's illegal activity. 



We were told that we needed to take cops out of the schools, to defund the policy, to no longer enforce school discipline.

We gave high school diplomas to people who can't read, we gave free homes and phones to criminals, and we gave drug dealers free apartments in the nicest apartments in DC.


The result? People are using their free apartments and vouchers for easy access to U-Street, where they hunt and beat up hard working Desis who are working nonstop for Uber just to put food on their table.

How is it that our tax system rewards people who know how to ""work the system"" and get welfare while someone who drives uber for 12/hr can't get shit?

How is it that people working for nonprofits don't get housing vouchers, but people who deal drugs can hang out in their baby momma's crib and smoke weed nonstop without ever getting kicked out of the complex?

How is it that our politicians and cops won't step up and enforce the laws on the books when it comes to Chinatown and U-Street?

I live in NoMa, which I really think is a great neighborhood with a lot going for it. But just in the latter half of last week and this weekend, the simmer of rage and violence has spiked. 

First during the week it was an angry woman barging through people going the opposite direction up the metro stop stairs, yelling insults the whole way up. Then on the extreme end of the spectrum was that senseless shooting in a crowded area Friday night. Then a more tame but still no less bizarre incident, I saw some tantrum-throwing teenager kicked a random passerby for walking near them while they were having a meltdown in front of their parent (?) Sunday evening. 

All this at once really jam-packs the NoMa experience into a weekend, but it’s been like this since I’ve lived here: disobedient kids publicly fighting with their weak parents, people having mental health crises on the street, random acts of gun violence, and fight after fight late into the evening. 

What the fuck?

I've worked for everything I've got. Babysat in high school, couldn't afford to go to a private college even with good ACT scores, couldn't afford to study abroad. First in my family to go to college. 

Even pulling myself out of poverty against the odds, there is an attitude in DC of helping the people who only want chaos. 

When I was in middle school, there were a lot of kids who wouldn't do their homework, and disrupted the class. When I was really young they were still sent out of class, but by the time I got to high school they could remain in class even if they were cursing out the teacher. 

In college, they chose to skip class and get along with sub-par grades, or dropped out. But in DC it seems like the people who never woke up on time, never turned in their homework, and want to smoke weed at Chinatown Metro and drink lean are the ones being protected, not me.

We all know about J-Money and the people who play illegally loud music, and the people who drive dangerously enough to paralyze or kill every single day. 

Yet when it is brought up to public officials, they want to blame the people who pick up trash, not people who litter. They blame people on bikes for traffic deaths, when thousands of people drive with suspended licenses and thousands of tickets. 

Not all DC natives are like this, but for those who are, we shouldn't mollycoddle them when their attitude is the problem. 

Nowhere else in the country would it be acceptable to drive 40+ mph in the city. 


In Virginia, if you are going over 80 mph or 20+ over the limit, it can be a felony. Yet in DC Brianne Nadeau wants to forgive the speeding tickets of those who kill my friends and make me afraid to cross the street on NY and FL Ave. 

On Metro my female friends are afraid to go out at night, and my East Asian friends get shithead teens making ""squinty eyes"" at Mt. Vernon, just because of the color of their skin. The schools and police do nothing even if they yell slurs when they are loitering and harassing paying passengers on metro. 

I grew up dirt poor, and never used racial slurs. Never used the N word. But there is a certain group of """"DC Natives"""" who think it is okay to work under the table, cause chaos in U street, and harass anyone born between Turkey and Thailand with evil racist remarks. 

Just for being a productive member of society. 

I do think some people in DC haven't gotten a fair shake, but I will not give an inch critiquing the """"DC Natives"""" who take advantage of productive members of society, who gamble in the street, who twerk on cop cars, who ride ATVs down 14th street on the sidewalk.

35,17g2urb,Xpost: Just was robbed at gunpoint at Takoma Park,"Good morning. My initial post was locked in the main subreddit. 

""Hey all.

Just wanted to get this off my chest. At approx. 9:30. I was sitting outside my friends house in Takoma Park on Poplar Ave in my Mini Cooper trying to get my car's navigation to work. A car rolled up, 3 teens got out and knocked on my window, and they proceeded to rob me at gunpoint. The took my phone, wallet and my backpack which had my ear buds in them. Funnily enough, they wanted to take the car too but when I told them it was a manual and that they ""didn't know how to drive one"" they relented.

I got smacked around a bit but I am ok. I am very frustrated and clearly, even in a nice neighborhood, you need to watch out.

Be careful out there yall.""

EDIT:

My lessons learned:

1) Do not assume you are safe. If you are in the DMV area, you are a potential target. I don't care if you are in the hood or the swankiest part of Georgetown. You are always a potential target. This is especially true if you own a car.

2) Do not idle in you car...ever. The reason they got me was because I was fiddling around with my console, not paying attention and not moving. As soon as you walk to your car, you need to have everything you need( such as your GPS) ready to go. If something fails, you should have a backup that is easy to access.

3) Everything that deals with any of your financial information should have an additional password / pin. My assailants made me unlock my phone before they left. My Venmo / Zelle accounts had no additional protection. Make sure you have pins and facial recognition on for everything important.

4) Have back ups for important identifying documents. I was lucky that I had an old valid drivers license and a passport sitting around. Getting my life back together would have been much more difficult if I didn't. Having a spare license is a great idea. Giving a friend or family a spare set of keys is also a great idea incase someone steals your keys.

5) Have trackers on everything. The more discreet, the better. Your car should have an air tag in it somewhere. Likewise for your wallet / purse and keys. The more ways you have to track your belongings, the better chances the bad guys get caught.

Anyway, thank all of you for your kind words. It helped me get through this.

For background I have lived in various big cities for all my adult life and (until recently) have almost never felt unsafe. I’m quite liberal. I hate when suburbanites and/or conservatives fearmonger about how “dangerous” cities are - calm down, when a lot of people live together, crime is statistically inevitable. Whether it’s on Fox News or seemingly every big city subreddit, the fearmongering is annoying and usually wrong. I’m sure many residents of DC share my general inclinations on this type of thing.

HAVING SAID ALL THAT. In this case, DC is **actually having a severe crime problem.** It’s not about perception or politics, the numbers are enough. In 2023, there were 274 homicides in DC – a 36% increase from the previous year and the highest in 26 years!!! Carjackings DOUBLED in one year, including a member of Congress!

Last night a man was carjacked and murdered in NoMa/Union Market in front of new luxury apartments where studios lease for over 2k a month. The crime is also spreading to previously safe areas in Northwest and it doesn’t seem like any neighborhood is a refuge anymore. I fear that I or someone I know will inevitably be next for a robbery, assault, carjacking, or worse.

Newsflash people, you live in the nations capital, not in 2005 bagdad. Most homicide victims are known by the perpetrator. Most shootings are gang related. They are not targeting innocent people like you and killing them in the streets like it’s the French Revolution. Please take time to revaluate your lives. Dc is one of the most expensive places to live in, if you’re so concerned about crime consider moving out.

“All these voucher holders are mostly drug dealing thugs”

“OMG! Today I heard my first gunshots, it sounded like an AK-47!”

“These moped riders must be those immigrants that were brought over from the Texas border!”

It’s not rocket science, it’s pretty simple to understand the background behind crime and violence in urban environments. This is not limited to DC like you would like to believe, this is common in all cities. DC isn’t even in the top 10 worst cities when it comes to crime. You’re not victims, you are onlookers. It’s like attending the Coliseum and complaining about violent battles between gladiators. None of you are victims of crime, and don’t come to the comments and talk about the time “you witnessed teenagers rob an old lady in your neighborhood” as if it’s some right of passage. I’ve worked in the city for years, I’ve commuted by bike and scooter at night time. I passed U street everyday on my way from work on a scooter for a year, and I have NEVER felt unsafe or witnessed any crime what’s so ever. Stop looking for reasons to feel victimized.

I would hop on a bike or scooter and take it across U st to Howard U, then up Georgia ave all the way to uptown, and I have never been a victim of crime nor have I ever feared being a victim. DC has what I believe is the second largest police presence of any city in the country, and it’s completely safe. Crime is not a DC thing, it happens all over the country regardless of the city. Im convinced most of these posts are actually just expressions of racial microagressions rather than actual crime concerns.

From afar it seems like the issues I felt before have just been getting worse and worse (more carjackings, murders, robberies, etc.). But I'm not sure how much of that is just selection bias - in that the news and social media will always highlight the worst of the worst.

So how do you feel living in DC these days, especially compared to a couple years ago? Are things better, worse, the same? If you have a family do you feel comfortable with their safety? Just trying to get a vibe check. ",2023,10,1,0
55,17jjwax,"A safety reminder from MPD after a federal security agent shot and killed a teenager trying to carjack him. They forgot to add legally carry a gun, that also helps ..","As of Oct. 28, DC Police say there have been 821 carjackings reported in the District this year, compared to 395 this time last year.. 

DC Police shared the following tips to try and reduce your risk of becoming a carjacking victim.

When you are on the road:

ALWAYS keep your doors locked and windows rolled up (if it’s hot and you don’t have air conditioning, roll them up at least part-way) no matter how short the distance you’re traveling or how safe the neighborhood.
Drive in the center lane to make it harder for potential carjackers to approach the car.
AVOID driving alone. Travel with someone whenever possible, especially at night.
When you are coming to a stop, leave enough room to maneuver around other cars, especially if you sense trouble and need to get away.
Always drive with the doors locked. If a thief can’t get in your vehicle, you stand a better chance of leaving with it.
DON’T stop to assist a stranger whose car has broken down. You can help instead by driving to the nearest phone (or using your cell phone) to call police for help.",2023,10,1,0
56,1e3k7ww,Foggy Bottom stalker again (case numbers),"I had more than one encounter tonight with the guy that has been following solo people in Foggy Bottom. 

I was heading home around 8pm, and first saw him in front of me on K Street between 24/25 Streets. I immediately called 911. When I got to the end of the block, he was gone. Still on the phone, I turned around to enter my building. He was coming down the alley and saw me. I texted a neighbor to meet me; she has also been stalked by him twice and filed a police report (CCN #24105710). 

As I waited for her, he paced in front of my building in an agitated way, watching me. He went back and forth several times. My neighbor arrived and the stalker guy left. 

As we waited for police, maybe a dozen other neighbors came home and most had also seen the guy in our area tonight, he is well-known to us now as an unsafe person. 

The police took 2 hours to arrive. Despite the delay, the timing was fortunate: Just as the officer arrived, the stalker guy was walking down the street again. I alerted the officer and he confronted the man, asked him if he was okay, asked him if he lived nearby. The man gave one-syllable vague answers and walked away. I gave my full report to police, CCN #24108037.

I am grateful to have supportive neighbors who share safety info. 

There was a News9 story from July 10 on this guy: [video](https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/local/dc/women-followed-home-by-same-man-foggy-bottom-dc/65-ca5716e0-244f-4caa-9291-3eb17ee5b47d).

Everybody take extra good care! If you have an encounter, call 911 immediately reference these case numbers. If you have an encounter, please file a report so there is documentation linking these incidents.

57,18ouj2c,I have an idea.,"Why doesn't the powers that be, crack down on everything? Why not give harsher sentences to criminals? 

Why not upgrade the doors at the metro stations to something that's harder to pass thru? And while at it station transit officers at each one and on the platforms? I get we aren't NYC but man we need more transit.

Also when it comes to the people that hate the crack down idea because it isn't solving the problem at hand about disenfranchised communities I have an idea for that aswell.

Why not have it so that unless the person applying for housing or section 8 is in a really horrible spot (and I mean really bad, like single mom of 7 or something) or just a elderly person. The people living in these places are required to either be at work or/and school daily and must meet a requirement to stay.

The kids have to be getting at least B-'s at school (kids above the age of 11)  and the adults have to be at work daily. Also money should be put into the ""rental offices"" to host Parental coaching, AA meetings, and drug addiction relief programs.

I feel like housing and section 8 should be used as a temporary thing by the people living there unless they're elderly or in a horrible situation.

Also pay those elderly people to pick up trash around their neighborhood something like $500 every two weeks.

We could install camera that run the facial recognition software and have it know residents of the homes and track who leaves and enters.

Also the abandoned homes (trap houses) can become the police security offices to help monitor the areas. 

The police training time should be extended from a few months to 2 years. I think officers should be physically and mentally fit. And they should have a regular test on both every year if they fail either they'll be on re-education/desk work for a month or 2.

Also there should be a higher outside power monitoring those officers themselves both in those neighborhoods and at the train stations.

I feel like this with some other things would greatly improve the over all feel of the city within 5-6 years.

This CVS branch in DC used to be well stocked, even briefly during The Great Lockdowns, until the BLM/racial hysteria riots happened. Since then shoplifters, with intent to resell goods online for cash to buy luxury goods or drug have been raiding the store.

It is so bad that CVS at one time had pictures of the items instead of stocking then because the shoplifters evolved into highway robbers by stealing goods from truck.

Now they don't and you litterly can't buy anything anymore, unless you're getting meds.

64,17j7mvb,What can we do to make DC safer?,"It's pretty clear that we're not enforcing many laws in DC.  I expect that part of the problem we've been having is that crime has been somewhat normalized by non-enforcement, freeing people who would typically be non-criminals to be more likely to engage in breaking the law.

Who's to blame and what can we do?

My laundry list of people to blame might include:

* Muriel Bowser, Mayor
* Kevin Donahue, City Administrator
* Pamela Smith, Acting Police Chief
* Council of the District of Columbia, including Chairman Phil Mendelson and Judiciary Chair Brooke Pinto

Who am I missing?

I would normally think, ""ok, if someone's not doing their job, we can vote them out,"" but I don't think that's satisfying here.  Even if it's possible to vote out some of our officials, some elections are far away.

Can we sue the Mayor or Police Chief to get them to enforce the laws?  I see cops *watching people* break the law and they do nothing.  If you say something to the cops, they say something shitty back.  I don't know what it would actually take for them to take action.  The DC Code says ""The Mayor shall be responsible for the proper execution of all laws relating to the District.""  If the laws aren't being enforced, isn't she responsible?

What about Congress?  Could they step in and exercise some oversight of the District?

Should we protest?  Get the press on our side?  March from Anacostia or Columbia Heights to the Mayor's Office?

Should we take things into our own hands?  (That seems like a terrible idea.)

Should we post videos of cops doing nothing and try to shame them into action?

I feel like a lot of us are fed the fuck up with seeing emptied stores, headlines about carjacking, smashed storefronts, stolen packages, cars, and bicycles, friends who've been randomly punched in the face, and everything else.  There will always be *some* crime, but shit's gone too far and the criminals know they won't be made responsible for their actions.

Are we ready to do something about this?  And what can we realistically do?",2023,10,1,0

As someone who's a transplant to the DMV, I also find Maryland to be, depending on the region, at best mediocre and at worst god-awful, with very little in between.

But then everyone else suffers from the kinds of trauma that are central to their politics. 

When stores in Anacostia close because of rampant shoplifting, the entire community suffers. It becomes harder for people south of the river to access nutritious food.

When people have guns or knives pointed in their face, they are prone to develop debilitating PTSD. Likewise for people who are just randomly assaulted by marauding gangs of teenagers

When Uber drivers have their cars stolen, they are deprived of an income source. Hell, having your car stolen is an immensely disruptive experience for *anyone*

The crazies are able to organize and push their agenda... maybe we should do the same.  Maybe someone out there on this subreddit has a good handle on it and we can actually mobilize (in a civil manner) to do something about it.

83,1bpge3m,Email from Ted,"Dear Fans and Supporters, 

I am thrilled to share that moments ago I signed a letter of intent with D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser for a major partnership to renovate and modernize Capital One Arena, expanding Monumental's business operations into Gallery Place, transforming Downtown D.C. into a premier entertainment destination. It is one that aligns our growth mindset with a public-private partnership, which we have been seeking. 

About an hour ago, we publicly celebrated this big new partnership with the city – the Mayor, City Council, Metro Police, our neighbors, and business partners – and announced this truly new and unique opportunity for collaboration. This is the first and only letter of intent we have signed regarding a new or upgraded facility. I spoke earlier today with the Governor of Virginia, Mayor of Alexandria, and CEO of JBG SMITH, Matt Kelly, to thank them for their time and efforts on our proposal and to inform them of this newly formally signed deal with D.C. 

The assertive actions of Mayor Bowser and the D.C. Council juxtaposed against our experience in Virginia evolved our view of the best partner to support the growth of our business. In the past three months, the pivot and great work in D.C. were in stark relief from what we ultimately experienced in Virginia. While the Virginia House of Delegates did great work in evaluating our proposal, the Senate sadly did no work in even providing us a fair hearing on the true financial benefit of the project. Contrasted with the open level of collaboration that we now have in D.C., we know we are in the best position to meet the next big objectives for the benefit of our fans. 

What we have been able to negotiate in D.C. gives us tremendous opportunities. First, we are gaining 200,000 square feet of additional space as we will expand our business and hospitality operations into Gallery Place. With this expansion of space, we have the ability to program the arena and campus to drive more options for visitors and provide more services to our players and our fans. We also sought a deal that would right-size our organization with the Nationals, Orioles, and Ravens as to their venues and partnerships with the City and State. We also sought a new level of cooperation with a government entity around services such as traffic mitigation, safety and security, and cleanliness. We also sought a better and more efficient way to communicate with regulatory agencies and cut through red tape with more efficient approvals. We also sought more direct control of our practice facilities and office buildings. And more control of our future. 

We expect to create new viewing options, better and different sight lines, more comfortable seating, upgrade technical and functional infrastructure, and modernize the building as we shift from an analog to a digital world.  

This new deal achieves most of, if not all, our key objectives. And I was very impressed with the Mayor’s stick-with-it attitude — she never gave up and was always reaching out to me to keep and expand our business operations in D.C. Gratefully, we kept a good dialogue going with the City and our Mayor and have netted this opportunity for a new chapter for our organization. 

And that is in no small part because of the tremendous work undertaken by Mayor Bowser and the D.C. Council. Since the announcement that we were pursuing a partnership with Virginia in December 2023, D.C. officials have taken concrete action to support Monumental Sports and the downtown community. In January 2024, the Mayor announced the formation of the Gallery Place/Chinatown Task Force to articulate a defined vision surrounding Capital One Arena and committed $400 million for the Downtown Action Plan and a Downtown Public Realm Plan to ensure the long-term success of Downtown D.C.’s commercial core. The Mayor also opened the first Safe Commercial Corridor Hub in the Chinatown neighborhood staffed by outreach teams from multiple public safety and human services agencies that will be able to respond in real-time to challenges in the community. And earlier this month, the Council passed the Secure DC omnibus legislation with a multi-prong strategy and tactics to combat crime, including a designation around the Chinatown neighborhood as a drug-free enforcement zone. 

With this concentration of efforts downtown and particularly around our building, we are witnessing the city taking seriously the central role we can and will now play in downtown revitalization. The Mayor has articulated that we are a top priority for her administration, and we really believe it to be true. 

Sports teams provide incredible benefits to the surrounding community and drive extraordinary economic impact and a strong public private partnership is essential to sustaining both – which the Mayor recognizes. According to research conducted by the DC Business Improvement District, activity at Capital One Arena generated $54 million in DC tax revenue in 2023. Across our region, public private partnerships are the norm for professional sports teams: the MLB’s Washington Nationals secured $700 million [app.info.monumentalsports.com] in public financing to build Nationals Park and $400 million [app.info.monumentalsports.com] in public financing to build Audi Field for the MLS’s D.C. United. The Maryland Stadium Authority recently announced a $1.2 billion investment [app.info.monumentalsports.com] for Oriole Park at Camden Yards, home of the MLB’s Baltimore Orioles and M&T Bank Stadium, home of the NFL’s Baltimore Ravens, each receiving $600 million for renovations and upgrades on top of the original public funding used in the planning, financing and construction of both [app.info.monumentalsports.com]. 

So, through our own public-private partnership, we will transform Capital One Arena and engage in new space across Gallery Place to create a truly iconic epicenter – worthy of this iconic city. We will get more space, dedicated resources to create the family-friendly entertainment zone we’ve envisioned to service our millions of customers and support for our employees and athletes to make this a destination to attract and retain their talent.  

What’s most inspiring in this moment is the City’s shared vision that we achieve great success in our business. The new downtown plan which Mayor Bowser has articulated is impressive and she has made financial commitment from the city. The passage of the new crime bill led by Councilmember Brooke Pinto is very important to all citizens and businesses.  

I truly applaud the Mayor for recognizing the incredible value we bring, create and help foster and for evolving the business-friendly climate in D.C. And today we celebrate this incredible milestone for our business, for our city, for our employees, fans, and athletes!  

Our work begins now to build a state-of-the-art marquee venue for with new seating options, five-star culinary experiences that go way beyond the traditional game-day fare, and cutting-edge technology, right in the middle of the city. We're on a mission to create a masterpiece – and redefine the sports and entertainment experience, not just for the DMV, but for all sports fans.

Get ready to be part of something extraordinary!

1991 born. The DMV is totally rearranged. I left for about seven years for college and travel, and now...none of the neighborhoods I would have wanted to live in, do I now. I honestly want to leave DC, but what is better for real? Baltimore? Philly? Atlanta? Miami? I am thinking of those kinds of things.

But for this sub...where should I move?!?!? Goodness gracious. Every review is: mice, roaches, bad management, and 2.7 stars for a GORGEOUS building. I lived in Union Market in a GORGEOUS brand new industrial style apartment and it was kinda alright (in retrospect). Mostly terrible. Had to call a lot of DC departments about the mice. Woke up to a roach crawling on my face. And I was paying 1900 for a shoe box with a squeeze in bathroom.

I left and moved with my friend in Southeast (my background), and it is honestly just disconnected. Getting anywhere takes a loooong time. Like 40 minutes because I have to take a long bus ride to the metro, and right now I don't drive.

Waterfront and Navy Yard look good. Only catch...no grocery stores. Overpriced and understocked Safeway and Harris Teeter.

I lived in Silver Spring for six years. Hated it then, but loving the thought of it now. SO MANY grocery stores and in general: stores. Why DC so empty??? They really don't want people to live here. There is NOWHERE to shop for clothes. You have to go to Virginia or Maryland. There are not even boutiques like there used to be. (I'm not doing thrift stores. I finally got a job!)

Anyway, feeling pissed off cause now that I have money for one of those overpriced apartments...I can't even find one in a neighborhood that is sufficient in terms of supply. I need to be able to shop and buy things without a major trip. 

Can anyone recommend something sleek, elegant, old-style class with at least three grocery stores nearby (including ethnic) and a metro nearby for less than 2000? I will sport up to 2200 if it really gives...""there"". Above that they're not getting from me (even though I have it...).

Must be diverse. Safe. Clean. Pretty. No roaches. No mice. Can be right outside of DC, but my job is deep in Southeast close to Oxon Hill/Suitland, Maryland. So don't say Gaithersburg! XD

DC govt run-agencies and programs have been in neglect and have fudged data claiming the violent offenders were successful in the outcome of such programs. There continues to be 200-500 of the same offenders causing havoc across the city and the surrounding area because they feel impugned. Work in rehabilitating these people by DC govt-run Office of Neighborhood Safety and Engagement (ONSE) Violence Intervention (VI) received a C+ mark- indicating poor performance, however the Office of the Attorney General’s (OAG) Cure The Streets program saw a decrease in homicides in 2023 while violence soared in the rest of the District.

101,188od7o,Repeat Ding Dong Ditchers?,"Anyone experiencing this recently?

My partner and I currently live in a rowhouse in the Shaw. Twice this week a group of teenagers (usually 2-3 dudes) no older than 15 years old have aggressively ding dong ditched our house. I say ""aggressively"" because they are kicking in the door so hard that I can feel it from the back of the house (I thought it could've been very close range gunshots the first time it happened because you know...Shaw...). A review of our Google Home footage shows that these incidents involve the same kids.

While I know issue is small fries relative to other DC crime woes of recency, the broader concern is the interplay between the fact that subject offenders in recent months are juveniles with the fact that juvenile offenses increasingly continue to involve weapons. (See Metropolitan Police Department Biannual Report on Juvenile Arrests between January 2023-June 2023 linked here). In other words, I worry that this ding dong ditch scenario evolves into a situation where my partner or I open the door to something worse.

108,1ab67ns,Two middle-schoolers robbed on school grounds at knife-point.,"A message from McKinley Technology HS

DCPS Logo

January 25, 2024

Dear McKinley Middle School and McKinley Technology High School Parents and Families, 

At McKinley, we are committed to a safe learning environment. Communicating home about incidents that arise during the school day is critical to maintaining strong partnerships with families. 

Around 12:30 p.m. today, as 8th grade students were returning to the building from recess, three unknown males, one of whom produced a knife, took property from two of our students. A staff member outside witnessed the incident and immediately ushered all students, including the two impacted, safely back into our building.

Out of an abundance of caution, we went into alert status at both campuses while we contacted the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD). During alert status, instruction and movement throughout the building continue, but access to outside areas, such as sports fields, playgrounds, and courtyards, is restricted. MPD arrived at our building quickly and launched their proceedings.

Around 1:00 p.m., we received clearance to resume normal building operations, and the day continued as planned with dismissal support from DC Public Schools (DCPS) Police, MPD, DCPS security officers, and Safe Passage workers. This evening, DCPS Police and MPD will maintain a presence in our neighborhood and parking lot through all sports practices and events. All releases from afterschool practices or games will take place from the gymnasium doors, where an officer will also be stationed. This plan and increased law enforcement presence in our neighborhood will remain in place through next week. 

We will continue to support directly impacted students and those who may have witnessed this incident in coping with the effects of community violence. For our 8th graders, we held a community circle led by our two social workers, Ms. Denson and Ms. Matthews, shortly before dismissal. Our social workers connected with students, emphasized safety and security reminders, and shared their open office hours with students for next week. They are prepared to support students who need time or space to share their feelings or ask questions. 

In addition, McKinley MS and McKinley HS have robust wellness teams comprising school counselors, social workers, and psychologists. Our teams are dedicated to ensuring students have a safe and reliable space to process these recent events or emotions surrounding them. Please contact me to connect your student with support services if needed.

The safety and well-being of our students are paramount. If you have any questions, please call the school office at (202) 281-3950 or email me at kortni.stafford@k12.dc.gov.

Sincerely, 

Kortni Stafford    
Principal, McKinley Middle School, and McKinley Tech High School

I would love to live in Eastern Arlington but am basically locked out bc of budget (~$1350 rent, ~$150 utilities avg).  According to Zillow my best bets are all along Rt. 29 in the middle longitude of DC above the river or in Congress/Garfield Heights in Anacostia.

For reference I live in Capitol Heights MD right now and I’m not a fan tbh.  Had my 2012 Sonata vandalized in a theft attempt but I was able to get a much newer car with a steering wheel lock and haven’t had any issues since.

115,19c8vfa,"[X-Post with the other DC subreddit] Would this subreddit like it if there were weekly threads about the schedule, location, and help getting to or attending ANC meetings?","Look, clearly this sub is worried about crime. There is a ton of anxiety about it, a lot of clucking about it, and a whole lot of finger pointing. 

But guess what?

The ANCs in different wards meet ***all. the. time.***, some virtual, some in-person, but nonetheless they are happening and without us actually going and continuing to be civically and politically active, all of our worry is just going to feed our online anxiety.

And you know what sticking to complaining online does for us? ***Crickets...***

Now obviously attending one Advisory Neighborhood Council meeting isn't gonna make politicians listen immediately or make you feel safer overnight if you currently don't feel safe. 

But ya know what will? 

If we increase turnout and participation for a *sustained* period, prioritize collaboration between all of us so we can build offline community and game out actual ideas and solutions, and, most importantly, make it clear to our local leaders that the current trajectory is untenable for our fine city to keep going down.

Will often be commuting in the early morning, late evening hours so parking is important. Looking for apartments  that can fit 2 or 3 roommates, keeping rent under $1600/person. Ideally in a safe, fun area, but prioritizing commute time and parking. So far, Brookland and Bloomingdale appeal to me based on research.

Any neighborhood/building recommendations? Thank you!",2024,3,1,0
130,17nd5ln,"Monumental asking D.C. for $600M for Capital One Arena, sources say","Around the same time, Leonsis started to grow frustrated with the area around the arena. He was particularly bothered by buskers, who played loud music outside his office. In the last few years, the pandemic and remote work have hurt downtowns across the country, and Leonsis has complained about the neighborhood and the city’s lack of investment in the building.

In May, Mendelson said he met with Bowser to discuss Monumental. Mendelson said Bowser was “quite clear” she wanted to work with Leonsis even though, according to two people, the relationship between Leonsis and Bowser is strained.

In June, Mendelson met with Leonsis and Monica Dixon, Monumental’s president of external affairs and chief administrative officer. The meeting focused on “how they could stay at the arena and deal with the deferred maintenance,” Mendelson said. In the arena’s neighborhood, residents and business owners have voiced concerns about criminal activity on the busy sidewalks near Gallery Place, including suspected drug-dealing that they believe can lead to violence.

In the past, D.C. has provided 27 police officers to patrol the perimeter of Capital One during games. But in recent years, D.C. police has struggled with staffing, and the number of officers has fallen to three, according to one Monumental official. The company has made up the difference by paying off-duty officers.",2023,11,1,0

14,1c85kwu,Just released from prison and I want to start a new life in DC…Will I make it?,"Hello.. so I recently moved to DC from NC after serving a 43 month sentence for non-violent crimes (released in March of 2024). These crimes were property related crimes in relation to an addiction to opiates that I struggled with for years.

During my incarceration a girl I dated in high school entered back into my life. This girl was living in DC and secured a good job after completing a graduate program at Georgetown. We quickly grew towards one another and she eventually asked me to move up to DC after getting out. To make a long story short, we got married during my incarceration so I could qualify for the “Interstate Compact” which gives me eligibility to transfer my parole from NC to DC. Obviously everything worked out and I’m here now living with her in a nice area of the city. 

Currently I’m attending an outpatient recovery program 4 days a week and I’m doing individual therapy once a week to help with my recovery. North Carolina prisons are extremely understaffed and funding is stretched so thin that I had almost no access to rehabilitation/recovery related programs while inside.

As of now I am solely working on myself and my wife is urging me to keep it this way as we are not hurting financially. However in the fall I am planning on attending Uni. of the District of Columbia and would like to get an idea of what my chances are of being able to grow into a contributing member of society. I am looking into studying either : Corrections Administrations (AAS),  Clinical Addiction Specialists (BS), also something I am very interested in is Aviation Maintenance Technology/Technician (AAS).

Obviously I have a lot of work to do and I’m hopeful for my future but I would like to know what are my chances here in DC? With being a felon and wanting to achieve these types of degrees and jobs will I face obstacles?

Also, any ideas for part-time work that may be applicable to someone like me?

I served 43 months, so by the time I will have acquired one of these degrees I will have nearly 60 months since the date of offense for my crimes which might help employers realize my mistakes were made several years ago and I have done quite a bit to become a changed man.

I’m not a bad person, I excelled in high school and went to  a private college in NC to study Pre-Med before receiving a tonsillectomy at the age of 20 and being prescribed opioids. This turned into an addiction which eventually lead to heroin/fentanyl use. I tried to live a normal life and fought addiction while trying to attend community college for a few years. I ended up in and out of county jail a few times and served two prison sentences (2018-2020 and 2020-2024). I was able to mature greatly during my last sentence having been sentenced to a considerably more amount of time than the previous 19 months I had served.

Today, I am free, sober, happy and happily married with an amazing support system. 

Any help would be appreciated, don’t hesitate to comment the reality of what I’m up against either. Thanks.",2024,4,2,0
15,1btzbaj,Harlow Navy Yard - Do Not Move There!,"Apologies for the long post - worth the read for anyone currently apartment searching in Navy Yard! I've been living in DC  for almost 6 years now and wanted to try a new neighborhood last summer, so I moved to Navy Yard. **The Harlow** had relatively affordable apartments and beautiful units in a pretty new building, so I signed a lease. Less than 4 months later, I had to fight the building management to break my lease because of a truly insane amount of violent and threatening incidents. **I want to warn anyone of this building - it is not worth your safety or sanity.** 

A brief list of things I experienced at Harlow: 

* A resident threw a large rock through the front door and shattered it, management did not notify residents and did not clean up the glass for weeks
* A resident set their own apartment on fire (DCFD twitter described them as a ""hostile occupant,"" while management claimed ""isolated incident"") and then shot out their window as FD was entering, putting entire building at risk. Was told this resident would be let back into the building, ""unless convicted of arson.""
* Next door neighbors had violent screaming matches from midnight - 5-6am regularly, walked around hallways half naked, smoked cigarettes that made my entire unit smell on a daily basis
* During one particularly alarming screaming fight, I called building ""security"" on my neighbors,  called the direct line 20+ times with zero response. Straight to voicemail
* The next day, management told me the security guard ""dropped his phone in the toilet."" 
* Building called police on neighbors, assured I wouldn't be involved, neighbor proceeded to corner me in hallway and threaten me if I ever tried to call cops on them again
* Shooting (10+ gunshots) occurred directly outside front entrance, building never notified residents as it was ""not resident related""
* Another shooting directly outside entrance, this time at 11pm on a Sunday, victim came into the building. Blood all over lobby, elevator, shell casings found in stairwell
* Management states they ""do not provide any security to residents, safety is a personal matter"" after advertising a security guard and direct line
* Two residents involved in bloody fight on bench outside front entrance, cops come, blood all over front sidewalk for days before cleaned
* Management claims they are hiring a night security guard - for 10 days after his ""start date"", no guard to be found. I sent timestamped pictures of the empty guard desk to management for days in a row, they tell me ""he was probably in the bathroom."" Every night? At random times? Sure.
* **This is the real kicker** \- on Sunday morning, a **homicide** shooting occurred inside the hallway of the 10th floor. Outside roof/club house common areas. Management is closed for holiday, takes 9 hours to notify residents, while there is blood in hallway and bullet holes in walls. And - get this - the police had to borrow fobs from residents to access elevators because the SECURITY LINE WENT STRAIGHT TO VOICEMAIL. The line they claimed was fixed after ""he dropped his phone in the toilet"" months ago.

**How can they advertise this as a luxury building?** 

Without starting discourse about Navy Yard/crime in general, I want to know if other people have had similar experiences. Is this building an anomaly? Is there any way to effectively hold management/ownership accountable? I tried the tenant advocacy office, my ANC rep, and submitted constant complaints to the corporate ownership company to no avail. I feel they are breaking some sort of law here by endangering tenants, and though I had the means to move out, I fear for the lives of those still living there.",2024,4,2,0

Scroll on if you'd rather answer the latest newcomer post about how it's hard to find romantic partners or activity friends in This Town.

Bike lane fights matter because they are analogous to fights you may more directly care about: [building more housing](https://ggwash.org/view/72150/heres-what-happens-when-you-try-to-build-150-apartments-in-dupont) in places you actually want to live, [building homeless shelters](https://dcist.com/story/23/08/08/dc-homeless-shelter-gw-dorm/) with wraparound services where houseless residents already have a support network ([diff link on that](https://www.dcurbanmom.com/jforum/posts/list/180/557686.page)\*), and [permitting daycare](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/excessive-child-care-regulations-dc-drive-up-costs-nick-ottens/) services in neighborhoods you already live with staff who can [actually afford](https://www.wusa9.com/article/entertainment/television/programs/get-up-dc/childcare-sector-collapse-in-the-district-if-we-dont-fix-this-dc-councilmember-christina-henderson-on-proposed-budget-cuts/65-bb719afe-0f5d-4640-9ec5-c326770a7490) to themselves pay for daycare (capitalism is fun). You probably wouldn't need much yarn to map out the NIMBY nexus of Wards 2 and 3, Always Sunny-style. I won't dignify them by naming them here, but inquiring minds would start on the losing end of recent ANC elections.

If you haven't already, I hope you read my previous [post explaining](https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/1c1xrmz/getting_involved_on_connecticut_avenue/) the conflict of Connecticut Avenue NW without diverging too far into technical specs, media theory, or sociology. Max Weber [would've loved](https://www.slowboring.com/p/welcome-to-slow-boring) Civic Association shouting matches. The fight on CT Ave NW is important because it's a microcosm of local politics, and my primary goal as a resident is getting more people involved in local D.C. civics in whatever issue they're passionate about. Journalist [Andrew Callaghan is correct](https://youtu.be/yEou104m_P0?si=AaXRFYs7I19BrvWe&t=7870) that local issues matter more and you can actually change stuff at street level.

Re-designing streets to add bike lanes is a [cheap](https://www.quora.com/How-expensive-is-it-for-cities-to-create-bike-lanes), [proven](https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/verify/verify-protected-bicycle-lanes/65-ec579ea3-8e4e-4f30-bb55-c65db77153c2), [equitable](https://www.minnpost.com/community-voices/2022/07/regarding-summit-avenue-bike-lanes-data-show-that-favoring-cars-over-bikes-is-inequitable/) design intervention to make all road users behave safer. The current DDOT Director misses the plot by [asserting](https://www.washingtonian.com/2024/04/15/dc-cyclists-arent-giving-up-on-connecticut-ave-bike-lanes/) that a bike lane project is not also a safety project. In practice, roads get safer primarily by taking space currently reserved for car movement and storage and giving that space to other uses. That's because motor vehicles are very dangerous machines; [pretty much](https://safety.fhwa.dot.gov/zerodeaths/docs/FHWA-SA-20-073_Lessons_Learned_from_Development_of_Vision_Zero_Action_Plans.pdf) the only effective way we've found to make their pilots behave more safely is to reverse the generations-long mistake of widening lanes, making them more numerous, and [bulldozing neighborhoods](https://www.ce.washington.edu/files/pdfs/about/Highway-to-inequity.pdf) for their expansion. If you give motorists ""more margin for error,"" [they respond](https://narrowlanes.americanhealth.jhu.edu/) with increased recklessness. The [red transit lanes](https://buspriority.ddot.dc.gov/) and the (sometimes) green -- not often enough physically protected -- bike lanes are favored uses for that dangerous, extra space. The other effective intervention for safer streets is Enforcement -- a [deeply flawed](https://arrestedmobility.com/) choice with at least as long generational harm.

It may seem like there was an organized plot to add bike lanes serving D.C. transplants who're gentrifying your old haunts. In fact, [more](https://www.npr.org/2023/06/26/1184034017/us-pedestrian-deaths-high-traffic-car) pedestrians and bicyclists have died on American streets than ever before in recent years. It's only in the last three decades that transportation departments have decided to (sometimes) give shit about that. And really it's only municipal DOTs that have done things. And many other relevant variables have gotten worse, like [bigger, heavier](https://www.npr.org/2023/11/14/1212737005/cars-trucks-pedestrian-deaths-increase-crash-data) cars on average -- with [worse visibility](https://youtu.be/f6k0-3QrZjA?si=WeDRidb22I1ROKe2) even though you ""sit high"" in the driver's seat.

Streets are public space, and [insanely high percentages](https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2019/11/27/parking-dominates-our-cities-but-do-we-really-see-it) of that space is currently preventing progress on codified community goals. Protected bike lanes and honest-to-god, enforced transit lanes make it safer and more practical to use non-car modes for essential travel ([moveDC](https://movedc.dc.gov/) master plan) with a propellant that is either electric or lower carbon per road user ([SustainableDC](https://sustainable.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/sustainable/page_content/attachments/SDC_CEDC_CRDC_ProgressReport_2023_Final.pdf) master plan).  We help businesses in urban contexts by doing [almost literally anything else](https://www.businessinsider.com/bike-lanes-good-for-business-studies-better-streets-2024-3) with curbside space other than infrequent turnover parking.

As it happens, the people who fight the housing are often the same handful of people who fight [against bus lanes](https://wjla.com/news/local/sixteenth-street-nw-bus-project-residents-parking)\*\*, yell on 17th Street NW about those bike lanes, and [try to stop](https://www.ward3housingjustice.org/post/op-urged-to-analyze-wardmantied-to-green-new-deal) neighborhood-embedded affordable housing. The vocal minority on pretty much every positive change you want for your community is held up by the same few who actually show up. And the people with real power, like business improvement districts and [politicians with shiftable positions](https://commercialobserver.com/2023/04/dc-considers-changes-to-planned-downtown-bike-lanes-after-cre-protests/), avoid real accountability to the residents they serve when the usual suspect pro-change advocates go against the usual suspect anti-change advocates. Often, when something goes viral, politicians deputize the trends and buy themselves more cover. That's exactly how [#DontMuteDC](https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/go-go-becomes-official-music-of-dc/2220108/)\*\*\* happened and [BLM Plaza on 16th St NW](https://morefire.substack.com/p/theyre-trying-to-hijack-the-movement) by the White House.

Public debates about bike lanes are [""captured""](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014292123001629) by media and politicians into stereotypes about cyclists as a tiny special interest group (and not literally anyone who rents a Capital Bikeshare or loves someone who does) because American culture does not see bikes as affordable, accessible, capable transportation tools. Frankly, much of the ""bike lobby"" plays into America's demotion of ""bike stuff"" as only a recreational nice-to-have to grab the scraps of road fuding. It is disappointing but unsurprising that [our hometown glossy](https://www.washingtonian.com/2024/04/15/dc-cyclists-arent-giving-up-on-connecticut-ave-bike-lanes/) tees up the next steps regarding Connecticut Avenue by framing that bike lanes only serve a small interest group called ""cyclists."" Few would write the headline ""walkers committed to sidewalk improvements,""\*\*\*\* and the news rarely says ""drivers committed to highway interchange modernization."" Only in American journalism would small, poorly funded groups of residents begging not to be run over on the road be framed as a special interest group. As if [Jim Pagels](https://wjla.com/news/local/he-was-only-29-dc-cycling-enthusiast-struck-and-killed-by-a-car-while-biking-in-nw) and [America Walks](https://americawalks.org/) could have ever been in the same stratosphere as [Brandon Todd](https://twitter.com/AlexKomaWCP/status/1779590447209263451) and [AAA Mid-Atlantic](https://ggwash.org/view/6553/aaa-more-cycle-friendly-except-where-money-is-concerned).

**If your group chat hasn't banished you yet,** one last bit of context: changing the composition of streets to make it safer and more inviting to bike or walk -- and to prioritize transit over private cars -- is part of a long but important fight to retake America's transportation networks for [cleaner, greener, safer, smarter](https://www.transportevolved.com/) options. This is sometimes called ""The War on Cars,"" a ridiculous [moniker we wear proudly](https://thewaroncars.org/). The short, disconnected bike lane proposed near your house, school, office, church, or daycare can and should be the beginning of a connected network where your family's second car gets sold in favor of an electric cargo bike. Or just that [your family can take transit](https://ggwash.org/view/87902/transit-diary-family-life-by-bike-with-the-mcentees) instead. It is [incorrect](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/may/05/amsterdam-bicycle-capital-world-transport-cycling-kindermoord) to say that ""Amsterdam was always like that"" and the politics rarely allows for the incremental change folks like me fight for. Connecticut Avenue NW is a big deal because it's a cornerstone of that shift here in the District.

In addition to The Wire, I recommend the TV Show ""[Show my a Hero""](https://youtu.be/PwqHZH1Uqvo?si=fm9n-rFZuJno368D) and the movie ""[Trial of the Chicago 7](https://youtu.be/FVb6EdKDBfU?si=-RVuXjUPjQyCiw-c)"" as entertaining entry points into local politics in the former's case and good arguments about changing the world in the latter.

36,1f1plcp,DC or “Second City”,"Edit:

My partner and I live in Capitol Hill, DC. We love the neighborhood and the walkability.

We’re getting to the point though, where things like a real backyard, garage, and dedicated office are becoming more of a priority.

But we both agree that we either live in DC and reap the benefits of the walkability, public transport, etc - or we are going to live in a “second city” elsewhere (Cincinnati, Louisville, Grand Rapids, etc.) 

When we tell our friends that our next move will probably be out of the city and Nova area they are in utter SHOCK that we would rather go to the Midwest instead of Arlington, Bethesda, etc. 

Nothing about the suburban life outside of DC seems appealing… mainly because of the complete reliance on cars and the endless traffic and the prices for homes are getting higher than in Washington DC.

I’m wondering if anybody else feels this way? That you’re either in the thick of the city or completely out of the greater area.",2024,8,2,0
37,19d5gwm,Melting is not an effective snow policy,"UPDATE, 1/24: The WABA Trail Rangers (maybe also NoMA BID) appear to have salted and ice-broke a lot yesterday, and the Eckington MBT segment is clear. By the end of today, temps will be in the 50s, and hopefully, the worst sidewalks around D.C. will get melting. It is important to note here that the trail rangers are government grant-funded shepherds of trail maintenance, and BIDs collect tax revenue from government-determined business districts. Some commenters say D.C. doesn't get snow or deep cold frequently enough to budget money for its removal. As climate change gets worse, D.C. will get more extreme storms more frequently (i.e. more random heavy snow and deep cold AND more extended 90-degree days). We can and should use government to become more resilient to these hazards and not leave behind our most vulnerable travelers (people walking and biking, on sidewalks and trails).

\*\*\*\*

I've been frustrated with the D.C. government's lackluster snow readiness on and near trails and sidewalks in the past week. Pre-storm salt treatments and snow clearing seem to have been done well within roads for the Monday, 1/15, and Friday, 1/19 storms. But the places for people walking and biking appear to have been treated less urgently by the government. Our major non-car travel corridors were at the mercy of adjacent property owners/managers.

Relying on melt from mid-day sunlight and a days-later warm front is short of the excellence residents deserve from the government. Sidewalks and trails are essential transportation routes. Our government should deploy proactive pre-treatment with dog- and water-friendly melting mixes and follow-up with quick snow removal using vehicles the correct size for the job (i.e. trucks for between the curb and narrow vehicles/snow blowers for sidewalks and trails). You just need planning, resources, and execution for what is a basic public service.

It's unacceptable for people to see if they can safely get to work by posting on social media, asking for ""trail conditions"" or ""sidewalk reports."" I'm very happy the DMV is moving toward constructing many trails within the big Capital Trails Coalition network, where millions of people could use a cargo e-bike as a second car for their family. But if all three jurisdictions don't treat trails like their main roads for cars, then that future is impossible. See the links below for NPS and other government agencies dropping the ball.

I live next to the Metropolitan Branch Trail, which was neglected in the segments near Fort Totten, Brookland CUA, and the Rhode Island Avenue Metro walk/bike bridge. It wasn't great South of Tanner Park either, though NoMA BID did some M Street NE ramp clearing. My Friends of the MBT group couldn't get out to clear the snow until Saturday morning -- at which point it was mostly ice. We cleared the Bryant Street Dog Park entryway and a few hours of minimally effective icebreaking where sunlight doesn't easily melt with salt that the government eventually dropped.

D.C. needs to get serious so this is never repeated on what will soon be an 8-mile MBT from Union Station up to Silver Spring (trail currently 4.8 miles). D.C. is getting better at this with the protected bike lanes, but last week's reaction won't cut it when much of the newer trail segments are on NPS land.  NPS let DDOT build the MBT segment on Fort Totten, but they still haven't knocked out a maintenance agreement. The MBT Eckington segment is currently a mess of ice and slick, packed-down snow. On the RIA bridge, WMATA, DDOT, and DPW argued over whose job it is to clear the pedestrian bridge. Nothing happened until the neighborhood commissioners complained enough. Government-by-complaint like this is fatally flawed.

If you've read this far and have a stake in the MBT, please consider signing up to volunteer with FoMBT - [https://forms.gle/ehr79phaTQndgvcAA](https://forms.gle/ehr79phaTQndgvcAA). We do drinking water stations and trail cleanups during the warm weather months, and apparently snow or ice clearing in the winter, and organize to get trail improvements all year round with local government advocacy. The commitment is as little as 1 hour on one day every 2 weeks to re-fill and clean drinking water stations, April through October. We hope also to set up tables at farmers markets to recruit members.

* As of 1/24, large portions of the Prince George's County trail network were still unsafe because NPS doesn't drop salt or clear trails, and the many different localities have varying capabilities for that. I reiterate my point that we cannot, as a region, claim that trails are feasible routes for essential transportation unless we treat them as essential from an operations and maintenance standpoint. You can't get people on e-cargo bikes with tax credits, convince them to sell their second family car, and then cry understaffing when they dump the kids onto the ground from an icy patch that DPW&T overlooks.

38,3din45,Update to Bozzuto’s Response to Increased NoMa Crime,"I just received a call back from a regional manager at Bozzuto in response to an email I sent yesterday to the president of Bozzuto Management, their PR person, and their Development President, and I had copied the Wards 5 and 6 Councilmembers.  Below is a summary of what was expressed to me, and I’ll try to leave my editorial comments out. 

The manager began the call by thanking me for reaching out.  She said Bozzuto appreciated when residents expressed their concerns to management, rather than leaving the properties without first trying to get their issues resolved (I think this is kind of common sense). 

She went on to say that of course Bozzuto is aware (and concerned with) the numerous issues in NoMa lately.  She stressed that they were working on a memo that should be sent out today, and that the company wanted to be sure they had all of their information correct, they were communicating in the best way possible, and they were giving us all of the information that they were allowed to give.  The manager emphasized (bordering on apology, it seemed) that she wasn’t making excuses for the length of time it took to draft this memo and communicate to their residents, but that Bozzuto wanted to make sure they had some answers and action items.  

She explained to me that Bozzuto does not own the NoMa properties but instead manages them for an owner.  Bozzuto has reached out to companies for cost and proposals for the following improvements, as well as approval from the owners for costs:

* Elevator key card access 
* Installing a courtesy guard on the rooftop/pool decks to manage crowd control

There will also be a new ID check policy they will be enforcing and will be sending the details out in this afternoon’s memo.

She addressed the suggestions I had put in my original email and apologized for the lack of communication.  I went on to suggest that, rather than receiving a cold and removed memo from corporate, Bozzuto holds some meetings in each or most of their NoMa buildings and conveys this information personally to its residents.  I’m not sure where that will lead.

Finally, though Bozzuto was not represented at the Flats meeting posted earlier on this sub, they did attend last night’s Lobby Project meeting, a NoMa BID security meeting, and another community event (apologies for not catching it) in light of these events. 

We ended the call, and she provided me with her email in case I had any follow up, and she thanked me again for reaching out.  I told her to feel free to contact me again in case Bozzuto wants “ears on the ground” feedback. 

If anyone has any questions, I’ll do my best to answer them here.  Fellow Bozzuto residents, you should expect to see an email with the official memo from Bozzuto later this afternoon.

Thanks, all. 

TL;DR: Send yer emails.  Memo taking forever.  Action items claimed to be in process.

* Yesterday around 7pm my gf and I witnessed a homeless man chase after a girl with his dick FULLY out. This was right in plain sight on M st while the oyster bar patio was packed. She had to run into the Streets Market so that the security guard could help.
* 2. This morning, I'm walking in front of Seoulspice and a worker runs out on the phone saying he needs cops there now and a homeless man was trying to get forced out of the Seoulspice by other employees. (while this was happening, dick dude from last night was casually strolling by. just a bonus)
* 3. Last week I had a shiv pulled on me while smoking a cigarette around 11pm (outside RESA / King st oyster bar). When I tried to get back inside, he cornered me but the oyster bar employees came outside to clean up the patio so he left when he saw them.

**I realize we live in a heavily gentrified area and this stuff will happen.** What's concerning is that it's happening way more often than it used to.

The city just did some attempt to kick out the homeless community under the bridge by REI, and it seems like that is what sparked the aggression.

Im moving to DC in a few months and want to make sure I’m not making a dumb decision by choosing Navy Yard. To me it seems like I can’t afford to live in a 700+ sqft and clean apartment in literally anywhere else. I’ve lived in historic buildings before in NYC and it’s not clean or comfortable. I just want a comfy and quiet apartment to relax in. 

I get that it’s not historic and doesn’t have a lot of character. BUT I work from home and don’t drink a lot, and I don’t want to live around crazy partying. 

Am I missing something? Here’s my criteria: 

-under $2,900 for 1 bed + den
-near trails/parks
-near good takeout restaurants 
-quiet and relatively safe neighborhood 
-clean 
-central AC preferred 
-apartment building with controlled access for safety (I’m a woman) 

I’ve found quite a few buildings in navy yard that fit the bill. I visited this past weekend and the crowds did not seem “libertarian” to me. Also I’ll mention that I won’t be living near the ballpark. I’ll be living near 1Hundred and Illume.

I feel like it serves its purpose as affordable high density housing. Like I keep hearing to live in DuPont but it doesn’t seem like it’s even affordable there?

and were yelled at and threatened by a 5’6” black man in black pants, red shoes and a beige reebok sweatshirt

he was saying things like
“ching chong ni hao” and “im going to push you into the train” and “im going to follow you” as we walked away

he got off the train as well as us. he started to yell “did anybody hear her say fuck” and such
we continued to walk away with two women for help and went up the platform escalator (thank you to the two women who walked with us after we got off the train! i hope you both can see this we’re very thankful)

we started to run up the escalator leading outside as we heard him yelling and coming closer after we went thru the metro payment gate

we hid in the nearby macys afterwards 

if anybody was around and witnessed what happened please dm me 

thank you!

Edit: some additional clarifying details after some time to collect ourselves!

- happened between 12:58pm - 01:10pm
- between dupont circle -> metro center, he got on at farrugut north and the incident happened right after that on the train and then off the train as he followed us
- he had his hood up so we arent sure if he has long hair but he was of a thin build (not very skinny but a little smaller than average) about our height (5’5”/5’4”) so likely 5’6”
- blue thin layer of material that went around his head like an inner hoodie under his reebok hoodie (likely a balaclava mask)
- most likely 22 (as stated by the guy), young 20s

57,pteigg,This sub seems to be astro-turfed frequently by far-right groups,"Mods are welcome to delete this if you think this post is too speculative. To avoid the appearance of brigading anyone individual user I will not name some of the users I have been researching who post exclusively on crime related posts here.

In short, I have been tracking a number of posts surrounding crime and politics in this sub-reddit. Each post seems to attract very far-right wing opinions. If you want evidence, look no further than a recent thread about the terrible shootings that happened recently. Though I think crime has become a more pressing issue in the city, many of the posts have a very similar tone to dog whistling.

I have been going through various histories of the users who are making these posts and I have found a few common threads:

1. Posts on other far-right sub-reddits.
2. Comments on niche sub-reddit with personal insults and trolling comments.
3. Posting on OTHER city sub-reddits with similar comments shown here.

For me, this raises a few red flags. Right now the evidence suggests most of these users and posts can be found in certain threads on certain topics.

If I had no experience in the DMV area and I came onto this sub-reddit and saw these comments, I would guess DC is a crime-infested warzone. Which is of course not true, just a city that suffers from the same problems since I have lived here, with variation of severity depending on the time period.

The rhetoric by far-right organizations leading up to the 2020 election really leaned into crime as an anti-democratic talking-point, painting ""democratic-run cities"" as hell-holes ran by incompetent politicians.

I see a similar pattern perhaps still playing out.

Take this for what you will. I'll end this by saying DC, like any other city, has its own problems, crime included. I hope we can work together to fix them. But this forum has really not become a reflection of the majority of people I have lived, worked, and made friends with here.",2021,9,2,0
58,1fpo3o7,Just Moved Here and Already Facing Harassment as a Woman,"I've been here for three weeks. Last week, while walking in Mt. Pleasant at 9 in the morning, I was behind a man who abruptly stopped, turned around, and tried to jab me with a fork. I veered around him and started walking faster, assuming he might have been paranoid (since he was obviously not in a normal mental state) that I was following him. I looked behind me, and he was speeding up and chasing me.

I ended up approaching a middle aged man outside a complex to stand next to him, realizing that the fork man was still coming after me. I quietly said that the fork man was following me and apologized for standing so close, then proceeded to loop around the man while the guy with the fork was looping and chasing me. The other guy didn’t even acknowledge what I said or attempt to help me. Finally, the crazy fork guy let out an angry noise and chucked the fork at a car before leaving.

Now, just today, I had a second incident. I was walking on a main street in Adams Morgan, being aware as usual and walking confidently. Suddenly, a man came out of nowhere with his arms wide open and mouth agape, walking directly towards me and pushing against me to the point where I couldn't go anywhere because he was forcing me into the main street. I wasn't prepared for this, especially since it was broad daylight and so unexpected. I held the guy back with my arm and said, ""Get off of me,"" in a small tone. He continued to push me until I yelled, ""Get the fuck off of me!"" really loud. It was terrifying, especially in broad daylight.

I've been here for about three weeks, and the harassment has been overwhelming. I take every precaution: I carry pepper spray, walk confidently, stay aware of my surroundings, and avoid using my phone. I make sure not to engage with anyone who seems unstable, but it’s exhausting to constantly be on high alert. I’m not sure about the procedures for reporting incidents to the police without feeling like I'm overreacting. I’d love to hear if anyone has advice or similar stories about encounters like this. Am I doing everything right? I moved near Adams Morgan because it felt safe, but I realize that being in a city means I have to be aware that anything could happen at any time.

Update: Thank you all for the advice and kind words—I truly appreciate it :) I'm feeling more frustrated than scared. It's infuriating that people can get away with this kind of behavior toward me for no reason, and I feel powerless to do anything about it—there's only so much I can do. I’m a 5'2"" petite woman! I’m not sharing this for sympathy; I want to connect with others who have faced similar situations and gather HELPFUL advice. I’d like to think someone would step in if I were being attacked, even though they don’t owe me anything. In bigger cities, I’ve had men confront those who harassed me, but here in D.C., it feels like survival of the fittest. Guess it's time to win the lottery and hire bodyguards.",2024,9,2,0
59,s8cihs,Living in DC is much better than I expected,"I moved here from Atlanta for work in July 2021 (NIH) and DC has exceeded my expectations in every regard.

I must admit some personal events left me a negative view of Atlanta. In Atlanta I lived in an apartment that caught fire due to failing building codes (electrical problems), suffered and witnessed repeated car break-ins in the supposedly safe neighborhood I lived in, and experienced the fun of Atlanta traffic. I can't put down the parks, trees, history, diversity, cultural life, or jobs present there though. Just my experience was bad for aforementioned reasons, and apparently apartment fires plus crime were much more common than expected.

My apartment in Bethesda is shockingly inexpensive ($1240/mo for 1bd 1ba with utilities except electricity and internet) and well-maintained. It's a 1940s brick apartment complex that's OK on the outside and super nice on the inside. Excellent heat and air conditioning, new appliances, and a clean bathroom. Shockingly Atlanta rents are approaching DC levels, but CoVID seems to have had opposite effects on rent in each city. Anyway, this was a giant improvement on $1060/mo with no utilities, damaged appliances, and fires in Atlanta.

Commuting is good because the Metro and adjoining services can do what MARTA never could. Also probably I never experienced the Beltway pre-CoVID, so traffic has never felt bad. Drivers are probably a tad worse than Atlanta lol.

But hospitality wise, I was shocked at how friendly people are here not just near Bethesda. Compared with Atlanta, people here seem much more down to earth and trust each other. I think this has to do with people in DC walking vs. people in Atlanta driving, but more on that later. Bikes in my complex do not get stolen *while unlocked* and tenants and I have helped each other with bike repairs and such. Idk, Georgia and Florida definitely don't have Southern hospitality, but coming from the Midwest I always felt that to be really fake (sorry, don't mean offense, just my experience).

Probably the biggest improvement, though, is transportation and how I experience neighborhoods. I walk and bike so much here and feel much better physically/mentally compared with being stuck in traffic in Atlanta. Moving here made me bike 500 miles in 6 months lol. I've discovered not just Bethesda, Georgetown, Rockville, Silver Spring, and Tenleytown, but also SW Waterfront, Navy Yard, Capitol Hill, Mt. Pleasant, Mayfair/Deanwood, Kingman Park, Bladensburg, Hyattsville, College Park, and Takoma Park. Maybe being on a bike made a difference but people were so welcoming and courteous in all those neighborhoods. Again I wonder if people being pedestrians more often leads to more positive social interactions.

Is it just me or is DC better than people think in the more affordable pockets? The only two bad things I find are high house prices (and general affordable housing problems) and bad drivers (lol duh, almost every big city has those). Surely there's more, but probably not very different issues from any other city.

Also, Marion Barry as you all know is much more interesting than the one sad story us outsiders hear of him. Cool to learn his summer jobs program was made federal.

70,1f2viug,I think U Street area is still one of the coolest places to live in DC despite its problems ,"Despite the recent wave of crime, I still love living in this area.

Not to mention all the history, many different types of folks from different backgrounds live there, it’s close to both the Capitol area and the nice areas of NW, I could go on. Like you can get to every different vibe in DC on foot. 

I also don’t feel that unsafe as an adult male, although the robberies are worrying. However, my only question is, why no police presence there? Mayor Adams for all his flaws has got cops on every inch of Manhattan it seems like and it really does help. Why can’t DC get more police presence in its busiest business district?

My boyfriend and I are deciding between an apartment in Cleveland Park (safe, but less action) and a place on Park Rd. (in Mt. Pleasant, but a 7 min. walk to Columbia Heights metro). We did a trial walk from the potential place to the CH metro at around 5 pm yesterday and encountered 3 kind of sketchy people either yelling at us or talking to themselves. I am concerned walking this route every day, especially at night.

72,o930zn,Predatory behavior,"While walking around Logan Circle the other day, a man randomly approached me, made small talk, and asked about being friends since he’s new to town. I’m a bit embarrassed to admit that I fell for it and agreed to meet up with him for a walk later in the day. Less than 5 minutes after meeting up with him, he made up excuses to touch me in a way that was controlling/uncomfortable (e.g., insisted on “helping me” cross the street by grabbing my arm without consent) and made vile sexual comments to me. I got away safely, have his legal name and phone number, and learned afterwards that he basically did the same thing to my friend. 

If nothing else, I feel obligated to give y’all a heads up to stay safe out there since such behavior—while violating— isn’t criminalized.

99,1gvokxm,Buying your first home in DC ,"My husband and I just started renting a townhouse in a cool part of town that's right on the edge of gentrification, making it affordable despite it's size and tolerable in terms of safety (just can't be an idiot).

However, now that we have fully settled in and decorated etc at the 9 month mark in our 12 month lease, we have just gotten word that our landlord might put the house up for sale.

I'm a bit exhausted by renting at this point, so my husband and I were considering buying it when it came up for sale. This would be our first home, and while we make decent salaries for the area, some recent medical expenses, job lulls, and our recent wedding have dug into our savings a bit. I'm thus considering whether an FHA loan might be the way to go, or if there are other long-term costs with that that I'm unaware of. 

Another key consideration in this entire exchange is the fact that the house includes a basement apartment that will be sold with it. We like our basement apartment neighbor very much and would love to just keep her on (also so she wouldn't have to move--she also wants to stay). But as first time homebuyers, I'm sure you can understand that we have also never been landlords, which brings up a whole other set of questions. 

I guess my general asks fall in two main categories. As DC residents, what should we consider when buying our first home here? Are there assistance programs, grants, credits, etc that I should look into? 
Note that the house is over 100 years old and needs fixing up/some critical repairs because our landlord is a bit of a slumlord, so we're looking for any help we can get here.

Second category, what do I need to know before taking on being a DC landlord to my basement neighbor? 

Also, I guess bonus category, a realtor told us that this property falls under TOPA tenants rights. What does that mean for us?

119,92w7zh,How safe is a walk from Foggy Bottom to Dupont Circle at 9pm? And another question :),"Hey guys, glad to be here!

I'm going to be studying at GWU starting mid August. I live in Spain so I am very clueless about life in DC in general. I was wondering how safe it is to walk from the University to the Dupont Circle area at around 9pm, which is when my classes finish. I've been looking at apartments for the past few days and the pricing there is relatively low compared to other areas, and the area is close enough for me to walk! 

Are there people in the street at this time of the day? Or are the streets empty and therefore unsafe for walking alone? 


And another question I have for you is: 

How easy is it to rent a room on AirBnB? 

I'm going to be living with a friend on a 2Bed apartment, but he is going to stay few days at home due to work (he has to travel regularly), so we thought about renting his room while he is away and earning some money to pay for our own rent. Ideally we would make enough money to compensate not getting a 1Bed apartment and having one of us sleep on the living room. Do you think this is feasible? Is the demand big enough?

133,o374jc,[LONG RANT] Stupid dangerous ATVs/dirt bikes on U Street,"Please delete if not allowed.

I've lived in the U Street/14th street neighborhood for 5 years. I know this isn't a new problem, I know there are laws preventing police from doing literally anything.

But now that people think the pandemic is over, the level of dangerous ATV/dirt bike activity has increased dramatically. In only 2 hours on U Street tonight, I witnessed dozens if not ***over a hundred*** illegal ATVs and dirt bikes speeding up and down U Street. At least 70% of them purposefully stopped in the MIDDLE of the 12th & U intersection (they don't care if it's a green, yellow or red light or if pedestrians or cars are in the middle of the street) to pop wheelies over and over, completely obstructing traffic and endangering lives.

I witnessed car after car screeching to a stop abruptly in the middle of the intersection, when they had the right of way, because 6-10 dirt bikes in a row sped through the red light (this happened almost every 5 mins). I witnessed regular bicyclists fall over and stumble off their bikes to avoid getting run over. 

I witnessed DOZENS of pedestrians crossing the street having to pull their friends, family, and kids out of the way because of this shit. I witnessed young children and girls on the backs of these ATVs, with no helmets, who could have easily fallen off or been hurt in other ways. I witnessed an ATV pulling a regular bike behind it and a kid was LITERALLY STANDING with his feet on his bike seat and handlebars through a red light.

U Street on any given weekend is the busiest street in all of DC, and yet there is NOTHING that DC police or lawmakers are doing to prevent this from happening.

Around 9:30pm a police cruiser finally pulled up to the corner. They parked their car and 3 officers got out. They hung out on the corner of the intersection, watching all of this happen as I was, and spent the whole time just chatting to each other and not paying attention (even when a rider ***almost crashed into cars multiple times***) because there is literally nothing they can do about it.

I understand that ""giving chase"" is not allowed per district police policy. I also understand that it's dangerous for both police officers and the illegal riders. But there is literally \***nothing**\* being done. No attempt to install high-res cameras to identify perpetrators, no new traffic laws (such as installing speed bumps, police checkpoints at entry/exit points during busy hours, slow zones or pedestrian-only zones), NOTHING. Not even a discussion about what activists themselves have suggested (a designated, regional dirt-bike/ATV park). Granted, I don't believe that will fix this problem because it's clear that they are riding on U Street for attention, but at least we could say we TRIED their solution.

I know as far as public safety, gun violence and gang activity probably takes a higher priority, but this is equally important for public safety because they are brazenly intimidating and endangering the public almost 24/7 in this area. And past evidence points to the same actors possessing illegal weapons, committing hit and runs, damaging property and cars, and more. One of them shot at a car that dared honk at them, several have killed or severely maimed people in the past.

There isn't even a conversation happening around this. Everyone is shrugging and saying ""well that's the way it is"". It's the worst it's ever been right now. And as a part of this neighborhood, I know I'm not the only one that thinks it's way past time for lawmakers to take real action on this issue. The majority of the perpetrators aren't even from DC. THEY DON'T EVEN GO HERE!!!!

This is not actual DC culture like GoGo, it's not art, it's not dancing or music, it's not a first amendment protected protest. 

I'm know people will say I'm clutching my pearls and tell me to get the fuck out of DC if I hate it, but I've coexisted with it for several years now, both on U Street and in other DC neighborhoods. It's just never been THIS bad.

I understand that Uber drivers don't know who they're going to pick up and need to protect themselves, but newsflash: SE DC is mostly fine these days. Look at the DC crime map if you need proof.

It's also incorrect to say that pushes to add bike lanes serve a small, picayune subset of road users and that swapping safe-for-everyone bike lanes with other design elements makes public space just as or more inclusive.

I'm writing to investigate these ignorant narratives and **ask that more folks get involved in the real, short-term fight that can impact the project's future**. I write all this because **decisions are made by those who show up.** In my opinion, the decisions we make about public spaces like streetscapes are among the most important.

The worst thing you can do today is become discouraged such that you give up. The best thing you can do is learn and participate over the next two months:

1. [Ward3Bikes](https://ward3bikes.org/) and the [Washington Area Bicyclist Association](https://waba.org/) have [**a petition**](https://waba.org/blog/2024/04/petition-dont-cancel-the-connecticut-ave-protected-bike-lanes/) going. Petitions are great, and this one takes five seconds to sign.
2. The Council is debating D.C.'s draft FY25 budget, and the [**April 30 DDOT budget hearing**](https://lims.dccouncil.gov/Hearings/hearings/365) is a good place to submit written testimony or deliver it live via Zoom. Any resident can submit public testimony, whether or not you're a registered voter. I suspect the witness list will grow to 150+ now. Today's CT Ave news came because DDOT's Director had [her day](https://lims.dccouncil.gov/Hearings/hearings/366) at the Council. The budget process is imperfect for project-level feedback, but the D.C. Council can force a specific design with creative parliamentary maneuvers.
3. **D.C.'s primary elections,** which determine many of the contested seats, will [take place on June 4 this year](https://dcboe.org/). Council seats for Wards 2, 4, 7, and 8 are up, as well as two of the at-large seats. I strongly encourage anyone living in D.C. for more than a few months to register and vote here. It's easy; there's lots of early voting and tons of public info on candidate positions, and their decisions matter to your daily life. I'm a Ward 5 voter, but on topics like transportation safety, I support [Salim Adofo](https://www.salimadofo.com/) in Ward 8, [Wendell Felder](https://www.wendellforward7.org/) in Ward 7, [Brooke Pinto](https://www.brookepinto2024.com/) in Ward 2, and both of Ward 4's [female candidates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Council_of_the_District_of_Columbia_election#Declared_3) are strong on this issue. The Ward 3 Councilmember, Matt Frumin, supports bike lanes on CT Avenue.
4. In November 2024, D.C. will hold a general election, during which you can vote for the [**neighborhood-level representatives**](https://anc.dc.gov/) who often serve as pivotal advocates for or against transportation projects. These ""ANC"" groups hold monthly meetings with public comment, and many have citizen committees to draft letters or get issue briefings from government officials. I encourage you to run for ANC commissioner; Greater Greater Washington [organizes](https://ggwash.org/view/86058/so-you-might-want-to-run-for-anc-our-training-is-here-to-help) supportive webinars on running for ANC.
5. Several local nonprofits and community organizations advocate on these issues. In addition to WABA and Ward3Bikes, I encourage folks to get involved with [D.C. Families for Safe Streets](https://dcfamiliesforsafestreets.org/). I find new perspectives and energy when listening to [surviving families](https://wapo.st/43T2FkL) of traffic violence and dangerous-by-design roads.

A great lie in our democracy is that anyone ever has the pulse on what ""the community really thinks."" That's not how any of this works. There's a constant, ebbing and flowing battle about what residents want. It's a beautiful, messed-up, complaint-based, squeaky wheel fest with a low barrier to entry and a high bar to overcome the status quo. Public meetings [aren't representative](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/04/local-government-community-input-housing-public-transportation/629625/) of anything, but we're stuck with them for now. So, I say let's all saddle up. Nothing about us, without us. If you're not at the table, you're on the menu. etc etc etc

**A Short History of CT Ave Safety Discussions:** Many years ago (pre-pandemic), the reversing traffic lane on CT Ave was studied for safety, and it was determined to be profoundly dangerous. In the short term, D.C.'s Department of Transportation removed the reversing lane. The agency spun up a formal study of a permanent re-design of CT NW with a community advisory group. Like all transportation studies of this kind and budget, that study considered a range of alternative designs. After years of frequent public input, it was determined that protected bike lanes and numerous pedestrian enhancements were the best design. Mayor Bowser herself announced this.

After that design alternative was picked, a pernicious group of repeat anti-bike lane advocates assembled what seemed to appear to lay-viewers as a large, diverse group of CT Avenue bike lane opponents. In fact, business and resident interests were mixed on the topic, and petition signees were often unaware of what they were signing. When monied business interests from downtown D.C. started complaining to Mayor Bowser about potential bike lanes in NW D.C., the Executive started to overrule DDOT's expert staff. In last year's budget discussion, Bowser removed the protected bike lane element of the K Street Transitway. In retaliation, the Council [killed](https://wamu.org/story/23/05/16/dc-council-budget-proposal-keeps-rental-assistance-pauses-k-street-remake/) that project's funding. So, this year's Mayoral bike lane veto is on CT Avenue bike lanes -- and it seems the Mayor is now applying a pro-car [""second look""](https://twitter.com/tomsherwood/status/1778499222771245362) to potential bike lanes across the District.

The recent Mayoral pro-car intervention is not new. I was one of a few journalists moons ago who proved that her office [was holding up](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VsVsoKqI3pqE89xzy0J4-US38ry2GTrV/view?usp=drive_link) bike lanes on 9th St NW from happening downtown. In the context of CT Ave and K Street, Mayor Bowser is swayed by a collection of downtown business interests who have profoundly misguided perceptions of parking supply as a variable for their corporate real estate values and stadiums being less full than in 2019. There would have been a 7th Street NW transitway through Chinatown in the last few years, but it suffered a similar fate.

There are honest arguments you can have about all of these topics, but it's just plain wrong to say the CT Ave and K St Transitway design changes were because of technical design aspects or some ineffable community input swing. What actually changed was that the BIDs of DowntownDC and the Golden Triangle decided they were against bike lanes after 10-15 years of building coalitions FOR bike lanes. In advocacy, there are times to play nice with powerful interest and do the long game and then there are times when all public space is subject to the half-cocked whims of dudes in $5,000 suits who don't know which Metro lines run underneath their building.

I don't really have an ending here other than to say you have the ability to create accountability and apply pressure to the people who lead D.C. and decide the designs of public space. I think it's morally abhorrent that some of our leaders care about improving traffic safety but don't care enough to make it safe for their residents to walk and bike where they expect us to live, work, play, worship, attend school, and raise children. Speaking as an expert in this field, the thing that matters the most for safer streets is re-designing those streets. And the parking modifications from the latest CT Avenue design don't do a pittance of the traffic calming work DDOT's staff claim they will.

*P.S. A commenter asked for backstory on the 9th St NW project. Here's a tl;dr:  I did this reporting while writing a paid substack newsletter, which is long-deleted. The other main guy was Martin Di Caro, who wrote the story up in GGWash before we all found out he was a harassing jerk. I saved PDFs of some of those old email newsletters for job application writing samples. Here's a Google Drive link of the wrap-up story I did after a failed Council vote to force the project:* [*https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tsqofrxPQMbc5nRcO8E6PmWXNnXsQB78/view?usp=drive\_link*](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tsqofrxPQMbc5nRcO8E6PmWXNnXsQB78/view?usp=drive_link)*. In the following budget cycle (or 2 yrs later, I forget), Mayor Bowser made the 9th St NW ""Eastern Downtown Cycletrack"" a pillar of her proposed budget and DDOT got it through a timely process from 30% design all the way through construction.*",2024,4,2,0
151,1h2s4bl,Relocating from West Coast and Deciding Between Rosslyn vs NoMa,"Hey there!

As the title says I am relocating to the DMV for work from the west coast and trying to decide between NoMa & Rosslyn to start my life in DC. The reason I have narrowed it down to these areas is simply because they are the only two locations that have been offered in terms of my corporate housing. I will be working mainly remotely but its encouraged to go into the office 1 day a week to their Herndon office but have full remote options so the commute aspect isn't a big issue.

As I am in sort of a life transition at the moment, my main goal with this move is to get the best experience out of living & starting to plant roots in the DMV as a 30 year old single male. Coming from the west coast my social circle moving to DC will be super limited. I only really know a couple of people and they will all be living in the Herndon area which, when I have visited seemed a little too suburban for me. I am really looking to live in an area where its easy to access events / social clubs / sports leagues where I can meet people & date. Personally, in my free time I really enjoy live music, going out to good bars & restaurants with friends, and playing / watching sporting events so want to be in place that enables those aspects the best!

Would love any recommendations & thoughts! ",2024,11,2,0
153,2ehmac,safety in takoma dc,"I just moved here. I'm in the Takoma neighborhood, right on Georgia Ave. I'm a female and don't know anyone in the city so most often, I'll be walking alone. I'm also taking night classes so there's that. Just from observation, some areas of Georgia Ave. look sketchier than others and I'm right near Walter Reed so I'm also wondering if it's deserted or not well lit. I'm thinking of taking the bus at night so I don't have to take the longer metro-station walk - are they okay? Some sites say the area is fine, others make it out to be bad and of course, it's all subjective.  For reference, I've lived in mid-sized big cities downtown.

154,13pr1g5,Verbally Agressive Panhandling,"Is there anything that can be done about verbally aggressive panhandling? I don't even know if this is the right term for it.

I was walking to work this morning around DuPont and a guy was asking people for money at a corner. I was stopped at a crosswalk and didn't make any eye contact as I normally do. An old lady reached the crosswalk near me and the presumably homeless guy asked the lady for money who responded with no. He then aggressively said ""My momma would have gave people money you bitch."" The crosswalk sign then changed and the old lady was able to walk away. I just gave the guy a look after he said the word ""bitch"" (he turned away before I did) and then made eye contact with the old lady before we walked away.

I usually just disregard whatever homeless people say, but this time it hits different because it was an old lady who was the target. It feels so obviously wrong for this situation to happen and frustrating that the correct response just seems to go about your day. Telling the guy to chill out seems like the wrong response because that could tick him off and who knows what could happen then.

Other than I guess checking on the old lady (which I regret not doing), is there anything that should/can be done like calling a social services number?

EDIT: Thanks for those of you who gave constructive responses! I think I have enough insight to feel comfortable moving forward but obviously feel free to discuss further.

I've reached the conclusion that the only thing I should do is check up on the person who was berated and to keep on with my day. Legally, in this instance, no crimes were broken (to my knowledge), so even though I have personal issues with the situation, nothing can be done regardless without violating someone's rights. You can't call the cops here because presumably no laws were broken and this homeless person could refuse any social services (if they exist in the first place). Quite literally nothing can be done from an immediate perspective, and as much as it pains me to say, it seems you can ask (and have the constitutional right to ask) old people (and by extension kids, etc) for money and call them all sorts of disgusting names if they refuse as long as it doesn't become harassment/break any laws. 

I'd also like to talk about some of the unhelpful comments. Assuming people should automatically come to the ""mind your business"" conclusion or is not concerned about homeless people/gentrification (or whatever BS I see in the comments) is not helpful at all. Everyone comes from different backgrounds and feels differently about things which is why it's important  to have these discussions. I come from an immigrant background so this treatment of older people is 100% not okay where I come from. I've had homeless people call me the N word with the ""er"" (albeit in another city), and while I walked away, I understand that not everyone can let things go in the heat of the moment. If you don't like people having these discussions, then I suggest keeping your cool and just walking away which is what I learned is probably best when something is being said that you don't like (as in this instance above).

EDIT 2: By some stoke of luck, a similar thing happened this evening...I was on the red line this evening and some guy started shouting at two females (I think they were, my back was turned and I thought it was best not to turn around to catch this guy's attention) while walking back and forth on the train and saying things like ""bitch"", ""pussy"", and ""you got 72 hours"". Not a panhandler like before and I wasn't really focusing on what he said. I just buried my head in my phone and got off at my stop. While exiting the train, I made eye contact with who I think was one of the girls and it sucked; it's like saying I know what you went through but sorry I can't do anything and your on your own. I think the thing that is getting me is that it's older men shouting at women (young and old), so there's a clear power imbalance if anything were to happen. I'm 6'2 and in my mid-20s so it's easy for me to just sit there and try to brush things off, but I wouldn't doubt if these women are genuinely frightened. I ranted with my family and they said the best thing is to just stay out of things, so I guess I again am committed to staying out things. If it's worth anything to anyone, I myself, and I'm sure other people, are willing to step in if people are in physical danger (and maybe when harassments or threats are involved but gotta think on that one), so just try to tough it out until there's a better solution. Not really 100% helpful but all I got for now.",2023,5,2,0

156,ech04x,"PSA: Many of the ""big"" black-tie New Year's Eve parties are borderline scams.","I'm sure everyone knows someone that's planning to spend NYE at one of those dress-up events at a hotel or prominent venue in the city, in exchange for a few hundred bucks. If you are considering going to one of these events, **do not buy a ticket without doing research first.**

I'm talking about the ones that happen in large event spaces, such as:

* ""The Mellon Gala"" @ Andrew Mellon Auditorium
* ""Big Night DC"" @ Gaylord Hotel
* ""Capital Gatsby Gala"" @ The Showroom
* ""Black Tie Gala"" @ The Willard Hotel

If you search for these events, you would think they're being put on by the venues themselves. **This is not the case.** These spaces are being rented out by promoters, who hide their names on the event info, if they put them on there at all. 

I've been to several of these events (shame on me). They are not all mis-managed, but it happens frequently, and every year the promoters get away with it. They charge $100+ for a ticket, but the catch is **you have no recourse if the event is poorly managed.** They run out of food before you got in? Too bad. 30 minute lines to get a drink? Nothing they will do about it. (And yes, 30 minute lines are typical.)

Because events like these are put on by promoters, the venue itself won't help you. There are few (if any) ways to contact the promoters. Some promoters, if you can even find their name, don't even list a phone number, email, or physical address on their website. The promoters have little reason to care about their reputation, because their name isn't really associated with the event. They'll just point you to their non-refundable ticket policy. 

Every year, many promoters operate the same scheme:

1. Rent out a prominent event space. The promoters borrow reputation from the venue since they have little themselves.
1. They promote their event (""The X Gala"") to local media and on Eventbrite.
1. The media includes the event in their run-down of NYE parties, giving it credibility.
1. The public buys tickets, since they know the venue they assume it's managed by capable people or the venue itself.
1. The night comes, and the promoter *always* under-delivers. Half an hour line for drinks. Bathroom lines may be equally long. It isn't top-shelf as advertised. Food might run out by 10pm. Etc.
1. Attendees are pissed and want a refund. They contact the venue.
1. The venue tells them they aren't responsible, and to contact the promoter.
1. The promoter, if they can be reached at all, points to their no refund policy.
1. Attendees can't post a Yelp review for ""The X Gala"" because it's an event, not a location. If a review is posted to the *location's page,* it rarely gets seen.* The promoter scrubs negative comments from their Facebook/Instagram pages.
1. Attendees eventually give up chasing the promoter.
1. 11 months later, everyone's forgotten, there's no online record that the last event was bad, and promoters repeat this whole process for the next NYE.

I'm not saying all NYE events are like this, but in my experience it's more often than not. And these events can get worse than simply running out of booze. I've seen hour-long lines in freezing weather just *to get in.* Two years ago at the Mellon Auditorium, there was one men's & one women's restroom for about ~1,000 people. You can imagine that line. People resorted to relieving themselves on the balcony overlooking Constitution Ave.

I imagine this is why some venues, such as the [Building Museum, stopped renting out for NYE parties](https://www.nbcwashington.com/local/internet-rage-festers-over-disaster-nye-party/2091983/). If you want to go out, go to your neighborhood pub or restaurant. Unlike promoters, their business relies on their reputation, so they're more likely to ensure you have fun.

**TLDR: If you are going to a ticketed NYE event, make sure you know who's running it. Most often, it's not the venue itself, but a shady outside promoter with zero accountability who doesn't care if you have a bad time.**",2019,12,2,0

Saw the moving advice page; it’s great but a lot of it looks pretty outdated. 

What I’m looking for: 
- budget: $3000/mo tops (yeah, I know)
- rent or buy but rent might be better for now
- 3br or 2br with “bonus room” situation for when my daughter visits. It’s just me and my son most of the time; single income guy here with a split family. 
- Walkable area or metro access is a big bonus but I can drive
- Somewhere safe enough for my daughter when she visits, or to walk a dog at night

The last part is key. I know my budget’s small for the area, and it doesn’t need to be “luxury”, don’t need good schools, but I need her to feel safe when she visits. 

I’m used to paying half what I’m seeing on Zillow or apartmentsdotcom in DC, even though I’m in a very safe neighborhood in Bmore (near Patterson Park) so there’s a bit of sticker shock here. Good ethnic food or local pubs nearby are a plus.

I assumed this would be a scam but shot my shot anyway to see what happens. I want to make sure I won't regret my decision, so I have come to ask everyone's opinion.

The person who made the post (I'll call him John for now) did eventually responded, and offered to show me around his place. 

A few days ago, I did come to see the place, which was a decent sized studio located around Cathedral Heights, in a large nice apartment building housed by mainly senior white tenants, as far as I could tell during my visit. 

When John showed me into his room and we had a chat, he (Male, around 40?, presumable single) claims that he works for the Department of State, and that the reason why he offered to share his studio for such a low price is because he (apparently female) friend who he recently shared the studio with moved out, and now he figured he had some room to spare. 

From what I can parse during our conversation, it's clear his doesn't care much about the money (he claims to have bought the studio outright), and it SEEMED that he just wants someone to interact with during the few months that he is staying in the U.S. His studio is around 600 square ft, extremely well furnished. The only practical downside to living there is that he only has one bed, and the studio is basically one large room, so my sleeping options are on the couch next to his bed, or in the changing room (which is sizable enough for a small mattress, which he offered), where I could have a locked door between me and him while we sleep.

After our conversation, he offered to give me a ride around the neighborhood, I accepted, and later he rode me back to my current place (I'm staying at an Airbnb). After I got back, I asked for his government id, he then gave me said id, and I proceeded to look him up and found very convincing information that proves that he is working for the Department of State (clips and images of him talking and working with people around the world, published by Consulates or Federal agencies).

Given all this, my only current concern (and I know this is very dramatic) is that I'm being baited by a professional serial killer or rapist. I'm fine with sharing a studio, the practicalities and privacy concerns. My only biggest doubt is whether or not I'll 1) lose my life, or 2) get assaulted. What other information can I gather about John to better inform my decision? What other actions can I take reduce any risks with sharing the studio? Am I being too dramatic? Would John be the worst criminal in the world to kill/rape a tenant given how much he has to lose?",2023,10,2,0
174,1frf8cx,Someone was unalived in my building this morning…,"Someone was unalived in my building upstairs this morning…

Good morning!  I just moved into my apartment building in mid August. It isn’t the best neighborhood, but I was previously homeless for about a year and a half. My building is 4 floors with 4 units on each floor. My upstairs neighbors are overly disruptive, to the point where my previous neighbor (who moved out) had to call the police 4 times on me upstairs neighbors. I have also addressed the problem with them personally and it continues. 

This morning, I’m up early and I hear a woman crying upstairs and a few other voices. I look out and here is a police officer standing with the group in front of the upstairs unit. I listen further and I heard the cop say “well it’s a crime scene now, we have to wait for the detective to show up”. 

I go to take the trash out and I saw another neighbor and quietly asked him was someone unalived upstairs and he said yes. I also just watched them wheel the person out, covered up on a gurney. 

So here is my question, how can I break this lease? In addition to this the neighbors, the trash has not been collected from our trash bins in weeks, worsening an even further pest and rodent problem…

Any advice would be awesome! Thank you! ",2024,9,2,0
175,yy0u6,"Question on living in NOMA Neighborhood, safety, etc.","Hey everyone,

I have the possibility of moving back to DC in the coming months, and I have been shocked at how much housing has gone up in the city since I left (I guess election years are a good time to be in town).  I have found, however, that the NOMA neighborhood seems to have some more reasonably priced, higher-end apartments (Senate Square, First and M by Archstone, Flats 130, etc) relative to the West End, Foggy Bottom, and Penn Quarter (my preferred neighborhoods).

My question is just how safe is this area?  My wife and I have a dog, and I have a feeling that walking the dog after sunset outside of the apartment complex may be out of the question.  In such a case, it would seem that we could only whole ourselves up after dark.

Thanks in advance for any advice.  I would be especially interested in hearing from folks who live in the area.

183,15repdb,Change in murder rate relative to 2012 - us vs other major cities (original content),"I knew we’d be #1, but I was surprised by how much.

How I did this:

1) Identified the primary city of the 20 largest metro areas in the US
2) Found city population from 2012-2023
3) Found murder counts from 2012-2023 (Riverside murders could not be found for 2021-2023 so it is excluded). For 2023, also noted the date of the last update on the murder count
4) Scaled 2023 from YTD to expected finish based on YTD
5) Divided step 4 by step 2
6) Divided each city’s annual step 5 by that city’s 2012 step 2

Why I did this:

DC is on a bad trajectory, and I’m worried. If things don’t get better, I’m leaving.

The city has gotten more dangerous. I don’t care that it was worse in 1993. It should get better every year, not back to where it was.

Murder is reliable as it’s always reported. It’s tracked year to year. And the murder rate accounts for population change. It’s (arguably) the best measurement for how safe a city is.

Why did you choose 2012?

Yes, 2012 is the minimum, so DC has a low base. So you may say why didn’t I choose 2013, after all that would be a decade. But that was the year of the Navy Yard mass murder (12 victims). For what it’s worth, I also did this analysis with 2013 as the base. If you keep the NY mass shooting in, we’re still #2 after Seattle, and if you look closely here that is wild because Seattle has a super low base in 2013. If you remove the NY mass murder, guess what, we’re still #1. Yay.

What’s the solution? 

I don’t know, I’m not a criminologist. I will say it’s sad that no one has thought “hmm it used to be a lot more safe, what were we doing then we aren’t doing now?”. My wager is on 2 things: 

1) the USAO needs to prosecute. Not prosecuting 68% of cases is a scandal and should get people removed. If you have an illegal gun, you should go to jail. Also, DCAG needs to punish kids who have an illegal gun. Why is it that having a gun isn’t punished?

2) police need to do their job. We need to pull cars over. If you have fake license plates, you need to be pulled over and arrested.",2023,8,2,0

In the chaos that ensued amongst neighbors and first responders, I trudged inside a zombie literally shaking and unable to process all that I had seen. 

I’m sick of the violence. I’m sick of not feeling safe in my neighborhood. I hate that I’m having to grapple with explaining to my young son that sometimes we see things that are scary and bad but we cannot say anything because the strangers know where we live and we don’t know if they will hurt us too. I have faced retaliation in the past for speaking up against problems in the neighborhood, with a guy going as far to follow me from my car to my front door, corner me on my stoop, flash what appeared to be a gun in his pants waistband, and ask me if I had any problems. 

I’m sick of MPD not doing anything about the PCP crisis. I’m sick that I’m in a position where I fear speaking up against the crime and violence in my neighborhood. It stems from specific houses in our area that are very clearly selling and using hard drugs, we’ve had issues with customers fucked up on PCP causing all sorts of disturbance while intoxicated and MPD could give less of a fuck until one of those crazy druggies comes out stabbing a random dog walker to death.

Also, here is the text of my open letter to the WMATA Board:

Dear WMATA Board:

My name is Harold Christy. I am a US Army combat veteran; a DC homeowner, voter, and taxpayer; and a near-daily Metro rider. I am currently employed as an investigator with the D.C. Office of the Inspector General. Prior to that, I spent twenty-five years with the United States Secret Service.

I am writing because of an incident that occurred on a Green Line train on July 16, 2024. I was traveling home from work and had just boarded the train at Navy Yard. While I was standing by myself, minding my own business in my suit, holding a briefcase and reading a magazine, individuals aboard the train began to play extremely loud and obscene music while dancing and aggressively panhandling in the aisle—all in clear violation of WMATA regulations and D.C. law. Their actions deprived me and the other paying passengers of the peaceful enjoyment of this common conveyance, and restricted our movements, as the dancers' erratic motions effectively occupied the entire space. While these dance crews are a common occurrence on the New York City subway, they have only recently emerged on Metro, possibly because of the 'depolicing' that many DMV jurisdictions have been practicing.

It should be noted that subway dancing for money violates multiple DC criminal statutes, including 22-1321 (disorderly conduct), 22-2302 (a) and (b) (aggressive panhandling), 35-251 (unlawful conduct on public passenger vehicles), 22-2001 (false imprisonment), and 22-404 (assault).

Outraged by this behavior, I demanded that the dancers stop their criminal and dangerous activity. They ignored my objections and continued to dominate the space with their movements and violent music. When the train reached Waterfront, I attempted to push one of the individuals off the train, to stop the unlawful, harmful activity and because I was in apprehension of imminent offensive contact to me and the other passengers in the area. The other dancer grabbed me from behind and violently threw me toward the opposite door. When the door eventually opened, I succeeded in extricating myself from the car.

It should be noted that I never let go of my briefcase, because it contained my official OIG laptop. Therefore, everything I did that day, I did one-handed.

After their violent acts against me, the dancers, as shown in WMATA surveillance video, continued to perform between Waterfront and L'Enfant Plaza, ceasing their performance just before arriving at the latter stop so they could walk the aisles and solicit funds from the passengers who had just watched them throw a grown man off the train.

According to an affidavit by an MTPD detective, these individuals who were engaged in obviously illegal activity then had the audacity to complain to WMATA Metro Transit Police Department (MTPD). Officers responded, interviewed at least one dancer and witness, and, even though the dancer admitted to violating the above criminal statutes while relating his version of events, MTPD did not arrest or even ticket the dancer. Rather, MTPD conducted a high-tech investigation, analyzing train-car and station video to determine my movements and pulling Metrocard records to identify me and place an alert in the turnstile system. In other words, they started a 21st-centruy manhunt for a man in a suit with a briefcase. For defending himself and others.

My next commute home from work, paying with my Metrocard again in spite of the packs of idlers who still jump even the new, higher turnstiles, I was met by three MTPD officers who had staked out the Navy Yard station based on my predictable pattern of life (most people with jobs and homes have a predictable pattern of life. This is why it is easier to investigate and prosecute law-abiding citizens than street criminals). They conducted a field interrogation of me, in front of the other commuters, and sent me on my way.

Several weeks later, I was arrested on a warrant for misdemeanor assault and spent a day in leg irons, a belly band, and handcuffs while waiting for my arraignment in Superior Court. For defending myself and others.

The United States Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia is now prosecuting me for this misdemeanor criminal offense. Under DC law, because the maximum sentence is 180 days, I am not even entitled to a jury of my peers, but rather the sterile legal analysis of a judge. For defending myself and others.

It appears that, in the words of Abraham Lincoln, WMATA and MTPD are content to see ""all the laws but one to go unexecuted."" I am glad to see that MTPD seems to be getting away from the days of depolicing. However, selectively prosecuting a paying passenger for reacting to rampant, unsafe, unlawful conduct is the wrong way to start this process. It places your ridership on notice that our role is to pay our fares, sit down and shut up, while the few malefactors among us make the stations and cars a horror show of unlawful and hazardous conduct.

No wonder every lawyer I have spoken to in my Superior Court odyssey has admitted to never riding Metro.

Thank you for taking the time to read this, and I hope that you will do something to improve matters.

Copies of this letter are being sent to media outlets, as well as to other DMV-area public officials.",2024,11,2,0

What the actual hell. Apparently, a couple got into a fight and a gun was fired. The bullet missed and went through an adjacent unit’s wall and nearly hit some girl just sitting on her couch.

The couple then fled, leaving their dogs behind. Those dogs were there without food or water for a week. That part I do remember because I put a complaint in with the front desk because the dogs had been crying all night and it was 1 AM and I still couldn’t sleep. I assumed I missed whatever else happened because I travel a lot. Apparently, about 25 armed policemen had to enter and raid the apartment.

Also know, that this building has been without power or water for over 24 hours and  the building gave us less than a day’s notice that this was going to happen despite knowing for weeks. They told a girl it was fine to move in yesterday. It was not. The elevators went out.

The victim or robber, I don’t know, started running at my friend and I with an open large duffel bag. I don’t know what was in there. We had to runaway and hide. We couldn’t use the back entrance either because the stairwell was crowded with people doing drugs who told us two girls in the creepiest way, they wouldn’t touch us. F no.

This place is terrible.


Edit: just spoke with management. The power thing is Pepco’s fault. They gave the building 48-24 hours and the good front desk people, who I really like, yelled at them to push the outage back and Pepco didn’t. 

Edit 2: lights and water are back on and they’re crediting everyone’s rent $400. That’s a really good response to this situation. I was actually going to withhold that exact amount too and I was worried that amount was overdoing it. 

I’m going to stay mad about the shooting though. Failure to say anything about it to residents, especially to the immediate neighbors, is still nuts.

The general crime in NoMa is out of their hands though. I am less mad at Bozzuto now.",2023,9,2,0
218,16x02p0,"Super late night/pre dawn, is there ANYTHING open aside from gas stations or 7-11 in NW?","Coffee shop, all night diner, late night bar, bakery, library, gym… literally any type of business open to the public where a person could go hang out at like 4:30-5:30 am? The reason why is a story for another sub but I absolutely needed to get out of my place at those hours and could not find anything to do except wander around. While I didn’t feel especially unsafe, I am still a young-ish woman walking around alone, and would have appreciated somewhere to just sit down and collect my thoughts without wondering whether it’s safe to look down at my phone for a few minutes. Is there anything at all open at these hours? I’m in Shaw NW, so the closer to there the better since metro wasn’t open yet cause it’s a weekend… but I’m also just genuinely curious if there are any places at all that cater to the insomniacs or shift workers or the like?",2023,10,2,0

223,13ujjig,Rock Creek Thru Hike Update,"Hi friends! Thank you for your support regarding our Rock Creek Thru Hike plan. Some of you had asked for a trip report. It went really well. We left at 6am and completed by 4pm. We started at the Rock Creek parking lot by Georgetown Waterfront and walked north along the main trail until Lake Needwood in Maryland. The trail was entirely paved and there was little to no traffic. The first 18 miles went by quite easily but the last 7.5 miles were brutal. We started to hobble and felt a lot of muscle and joint pain. Still hobbling one day later but recovering well. Saw two bald eagles, several deer, and a black snake. Ate a Harris Teeter Turkey sandwich from the sandwich station for lunch. We aimed for approximately 20 mins per mile with a 1 hour lunch and rest. Lots of water throughout and restrooms as well. Overall it was a great time and I am grateful for having Rock Creek in our community. (PS I heard it’s technically safe enough to swim up in Maryland but not permitted). Hope to do something like this with the C&O next.",2023,5,2,0

However, I've seen some reviews of apartments I've looked at mention feeling unsafe in the neighborhood occasionally. One apartment I'm looking at is in the 16th St NW/Columbia Rd area while the other is in the 13th St NW/Clifton St area. What are your thoughts on the safety of those areas? For reference, I'll be living alone, and I'm a single woman in her 20s.",2021,8,2,0
