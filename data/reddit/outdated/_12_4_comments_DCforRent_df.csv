It’s about 10 minutes from my door to the train platform, and there’s a Giant grocery store with a solid selection. I think there’s also a Safeway, but I’ve never been. There’s a new urgent care, a CVS, some reasonable (for DC) priced restaurants and some upscale restaurants, some gyms, and a UPS off the top of my head. Really the only thing I miss is a bank - there was a Wells Fargo nearby two years ago, but it’s been gone.

Where I live, you can go in one direction to make your way into the heart of the city, or you can go the other to get to nature. I live across the street from a park, and it’s about half a mile to Rock Creek Park. It’s usually pretty quiet here, for the city.

I am a full time student and work full time. It’s tough sometimes for me without any familial support, but I have been here two years. It’s only getting better as time goes on. You sound as if you’re in a much stronger financial position than me, so you’d do well here.

Finally, I can’t answer this perfectly for you as a man, but nighttime is generally safe here, for the city. I am a night owl and will walk at night during warm months (talking anytime between 8 PM and 1 AM) - I haven’t had any problems. But again, I’m a man.",2,2023,10

As for location and buildings, you have to get away from the luxury type of buildings in NoMa/H Street/Navy Yard etc. Find the older buildings in the NW that the other person mentioned, because they will have bigger for the same cost or even less money. They will have rent control. They might have very basic amenities like a small gym but they have what is necessary like a laundry room and often a front desk concierge person and package receiving.

I have lived in DC for several years and generally recommend Bloomingdale or Takoma Park (in Maryland) area for people who like a mix. For those who want to live more outside the city and have a car, Woodbridge, VA is a nice place.

I have friends who stay at ""luxury"" or very nice apartments yet they struggle to get maintenance in or noise problems resolved. They also get hidden fees. My recommendation is to rent from people, not companies. Currently, I am helping my landlord find a new tenant for this unit in Columbia Heights, which is in DC but quieter. I wouldn't walk around at night as I am a cautious risk averse women, but this neighborhood, and Petwoth, are super nice for being ""in"" the city.

The fact you are only looking for 6 months and want something that starts next week will also make it much more difficult although I’m sure you’re already aware of that. 

I would suggest looking at Columbia Heights or Petworth for better deals. 

I’d also suggest looking on Craigslist. I know it can be sketchy but you can get lucky.

If you are thinking about living in DC itself, I doubt you will find a 2/1.5+ for anything under 2.1K, at least anywhere close to the area you are saying your job is at.  2.5K would probably be a better bet.  Southern Bethesda is going to be about the same.

You said you want parking.  If you are willing to commute by car, you might be able to make that budget work.  You are probably going to need to live outside the beltway north in Maryland.  I just did a search, and it seems like this place might be in your budget:

The Monterey Apartments
5901 Montrose Rd, North Bethesda, MD 20852

They seems to have two bedroom units for $1700.  I don't know the area personally, so you'd have to ask someone else about safety.  You might even be able to make the red line work there.

Oh, and a word of warning:  summer is typically the ""hot"" season (yes, I see the pun).  So there is a good chance most places will be charging more.  You might want to look into trying to lock in a place in April or May if you can.

236,1ieety,meelar,"The answer to ""how to afford the rent"" is generally to economize in other areas.  There are plenty of people that don't own cars in DC (it's totally unnecessary unless your work is far away and not Metro-accessible), so the money they're currently spending on car payments and insurance can go to rent instead.  Jobs do tend to pay more here as well.  The other solution to expensive housing is roommates.  If you share a group house, your rent is much cheaper than somebody who lives alone in a studio or one-bedroom.  If your max is $700, you will probably have to get a room in a shared house--that is very low for a studio almost anywhere in the city.  It could happen, but don't completely count on it.

As for crime, it does happen, but ultimately I wouldn't let it dissuade me from moving here.  Don't leave anything valuable--or honestly anything at all--in your car if you're parking it on the street.  Be aware when you're walking around.  Generally, these two tips are enough to keep you out of trouble.

Can't really help with the rest of your questions.  Good luck with the move!",2,2013,07
237,1ieety,,"> Why is it that there are so many people who will only accept gay (or specifically, black gay) room mates? I've come across so many ads specifically limiting housing to non-straight males. I've never seen that before.


I personally haven't seen any ads that specify gay males only (and I'm a gay male myself) but I have assume that people don't want to deal with the whole coming out process again when new roommates move in (and trust me, we do this all our lives and it does get frustrating).  I'm curious on where you are finding these ads.



> Along with that, I don't smoke but I've seen countless ads requesting Non-Smokers only. Is smoking indoors a huge problem in D.C.? It seems strange to me that folks would be so explicit about something like that. Where I'm from, people tend to keep their bad habits outdoors where it won't bother anybody.


Unfortunatley, living in a large of a city as DC introduces all kinds of people including ones that don't have respect to take their smoking habits outside.  There are people who do smoke inside who either A.) don't realize that their indoor daily smoking habits causes damages to the walls and paint of a home or B.) don't care because it is not their property.  Repairing the smoke damage is expensive as hell.



>  Rent prices. I am honestly curious how people can afford $1200/mo rent for apartments in ""transition"" neighborhoods. I'm looking to settle into a $700/mo shoebox in Petworth because that is the absolute max i can afford but are jobs just so lucrative in our nations capital that +$1000 is nothing? 


Unfortunately, living in a high demand city such as DC drives the rent markets up to at least a $1000+ in rent in the more desired are parts of DC.  Now you can play the financial game a bit and find something that does meet your standards but you have to sacrifice a bit.  For example, I have seen places around the surround areas (Arlington, Alexandria) where one can rent a studio apartment for $1250-$1400 a month and it includes utilties (minus phone/internet) and parking.  If you think about it, utilties can run up to $150-200 and parking an additional $100-150.  So rent can effectively run between $900 (best case) to $1150 (worst case).  For a place of 400 sq-ft to call your own for that price in DC is not too shabby.  On top of that, if you find something that is near a metro, then your commute costs are introduced to the overall living costs.  Again balance.


The rule of thumb for DC when finding a place to rent on your own is this:  convenience, price, safety -- pick two out of the three.  If you sacrifice safety, pick something that is SE or NE of DC where crime is a problem.  If you sacrifice price, then look into something in downtown DC where it is insanely expensive.  If you sacrifice covenience, then look at something at the outerskirts of the DMV area where your commute is a minimum 1+ hours.  If you find something that fits all three (and they exist), then you found a golden goose.


>  Crime. The crime maps suggest that having your car broken into and being mugged are not uncommon. Why is this? What can you do (aside from don't attract attention to yourself) to avoid being a victim? I'm genuinely curious.


You be very surprised of how much people leave their shit in their car in plain view.  On top of that, NW DC is relatively rich compared to NE or SE of DC so items being stolen have a tendency of being more expensive.  One of the easiest ways to avoid this situation is not leave your ipod or kindle in plain view.  Even if you take precautions, there is an off chance that someone will just go on a crime spree and break in a row of cars down a street.  That's the price of living in a city as large as DC.



> Where do all the house shows happen? I haven't found many basements in my search. Are basement shows a thing in D.C.?


Typically on weekends.  Awesome hard-to-find rentals are snatched up very quickly so if you don't have a preplan when you a rental search then you will be at a disadvantage of finding a place that is worth your time and money.  FYI, if you are looking at basement rentals, please get renter's insurance that includes flooding.  I heard that some DC rentals are notorious for having their basements flooded and it screws the tenant who lives there if they don't have the right kind of insurance.",2,2013,07
238,1ieety,am2o,"1) Gay/Black/whatever: Have not seen it, but there are some people who just don't want to have to deal with judgement & assume if room-mates are ""like me"" then any friends brought home won't judge.
  
2) Smokers: Smoking stinks the place up & is expensive to get rid of. (All walls and ceilings have to be sanded (All surfaces really) and painted.) This is expensive. It's hard to find people who will do basic prep, nevermind sanding the tar off all surfaces before painting.  
  
3) Prices: DC is one of the more expensive places to live. It's estimated that it takes the ""average"" person 80 hours to afford to live in dc. There is Washington (The rich white folk), and the rest of DC (Everybody else). At $700, you are probably looking at a room in a group house, or a tiny basement apartment.

Seriously, though, you'll do well to use the [map search function on Craigslist](http://washingtondc.craigslist.org/search/apa?minAsk=&maxAsk=1500&minSqft=&maxSqft=&query=). Anywhere within a half mile or so of a Metro in Arlington should be (and even feel) safe. Likewise, in DC, most of the more established neighborhoods around the Metros (though perhaps less so on the East side of the Anacostia river) should also be plenty safe. Arlington has kind of a yuppie feel, whereas DC varies by neighborhood. There's usually a lot more going on in DC.

Depending on your commute to work, I'd suggest looking around the Columbia Heights, U Street, or Shaw Metros (green/yellow lines) or Woodley Park or Dupont Circle (red line). Capitol Hill (Capitol South through Stadium Armory) is also nice, but it's mostly townhouses. Most studios/1 bedrooms here are in basements (you could do closer to H Street NE, which is a great neighborhood, but you'd be more reliant on buses to get to the Metro). 

Also, you'll likely see a lot of listings for Crystal City in Arlington. It's very safe, so don't be scared of it, but it's also an exceptionally boring neighborhood that gets nearly dead at night. Most things happening there are the primary landlord's (Vornado) attempts to make it seem hip. I haven't seen any recent stats, but, when I moved to DC, Crystal City had something like 70,000 people working there and only 6,000 living there, and it feels like it every day when I get out of the office late.",5,2015,04
