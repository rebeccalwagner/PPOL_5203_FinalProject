I'm pretty aware of my surroundings and would think that I can defend myself in most situations. That said, I am petite and would feel like I am an easy target for those that are looking for one, if I happen to be walking alone. I wouldn't walk on my own after dark. I'd likely take a cab or Uber home if it's late and I'm alone, and I carry pepper spray with me at all times.

I have been looking at studios and 1 bedrooms in Eastern Market, though many places that advertise as Eastern Market are really closer to Trinidad which doesn't have a great reputation.

1fbmdlr,Room in Glover Park 2bd/2ba,"I am looking for someone to take over my lease in a 2 bed 1 bath apartment in Glover Park starting in the middle of October 2024 (date flexible). The lease term ends in May 2025, but it is open to renewal. Rent is $1075 a month plus utilities (which average around $80-$100 a month, sometimes less). This room is the bigger of the two included in the unit. 

The kitchen in the unit would come mostly furnished, and the common area will be furnished by both you and the current roommate. Most of the items in the room itself (the room with the blue carpet) will not be included. 

A bit more about the space:
The unit is small but cozy, with a full kitchen, living room, and mudroom / storage room / potential sunroom. There’s a newly renovated balcony that is really nice for hosting!
Parking is available for around $100/month, if you have a car. There is also plenty of parking space. 
It is located right next to Glover Park, about a 25 minute walk north from Georgetown.
Trader Joe’s and Safeway are both within easy walking distance.
The space has easy access to the D2, D6, and 33 bus lines. The D2 line takes you to DuPont circle, straight to the red metro line. The 33 line takes you from Friendship Heights to the national Mall area.
The neighborhood is super friendly and very walkable. I often go on walks later in the evening and always feel safe.
The landlady is nice and responsive to maintenance requests.

The current roommate is a guy in his mid-20s, working in consulting.

What we’re looking for: 
A working professional in mid to late 20’s. 
Preferably no pets. 
Someone who values cleanliness, communication, and a respect for private spaces/time.

1dljgkt,"Bedroom in prime Columbia Heights rowhouse, $1075 per month starting August 1st","Hello!

I’m moving away from DC to do a Fulbright and am looking for a sublease/lease takeover for my bedroom in a lovely rowhouse right in the center of Columbia Heights.

This is a three-bedroom rowhouse with one full bathroom upstairs and one half bathroom downstairs. My room is the middle room, but still a great size. It has one nice north-facing window which looks out onto the backyard and the next street and gets good light. The window sits in front of a nook, which is where I have my desk, though you could also easily rearrange things. The rest of the room is rectangular, with hardwood flooring, and also has a huge walk-in closet with built-in shelves and racks for hanging clothes on both sides, as well as plenty of space for extra storage. There are plenty of outlets for extra lamps in addition to the overhead light.

Upstairs alongside the other two bedrooms, the bathroom has nice tile floors, a full tub with a huge flat fixed showerhead and removable showerhead, and a modern wood vanity and large mirror. The bathroom also has a huge skylight which gives it great natural light throughout the day. In the upstairs hallway, there is another nook for the modern washing machine and dryer, along with an even bigger skylight for natural light. The hardwood floors also continue throughout, including downstairs in the spacious entrance hallway, living room, and dining room.

My favorite part of the house is the kitchen, which has a gas stove, great counter space, a massive island, tons of cabinets and drawers for storage, and modern refrigerator, microwave, dishwasher, and other small appliances. The kitchen looks out into the backyard through a wide sliding screened window and glass door. The backyard itself is a good size and fenced in, with tables both on the balcony and below (though we’re in the process of cleaning in the pictures).

The house is old but in good shape. It’s owned by a private landlord, a family with kids who used to live here as their personal residence before they moved to another neighborhood in DC. The dad still handles all the maintenance and is generally very responsive. The other roommates are two young professionals in their late twenties (both men), one an embassy employee and the other a software developer. Both are very nice and easy to get along with!

The house is located on Monroe Street in Columbia Heights, on a very quiet and safe street with lots of families. It’s just around the corner from Columbia Heights Plaza and all the amenities there: a 3 minute walk to the Columbia Heights metro station on the Green Line, 2 minutes to three different grocery stores (Target, Giant, and Lidl), and also surrounded by lots of great restaurants. It’s also about a 7 minute walk to the heart of Mount Pleasant.

I’m looking to sublease my room starting August 1. My lease runs until September 30, so a 2-month term and it’s for $1,075 per month + utilities. You would almost certainly have the option to sign a full 1-year lease following the sublease and starting October 1 if you wanted. The landlord would also likely be willing to start a 1-year lease on August 1 if you’d prefer, as each of the bedrooms is on a separate lease and term.

Let me know if you’re interested and would like to tour in-person or virtually! You’d then meet the roommates and would have to do a quick check with the landlord. And I’m happy to answer any other questions you might have.

1cvsvu4,Lease takeover - own bedroom and bathroom in 2bd/2ba apartment right next to the red line - $1630 per month. Free rent in June.,"\*\*Key details\*\* 

This is 1 bedroom and 1 bathroom in a shared 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom apartment. Your share of the rent would be $1630 a month + utilities (which are usually around $60 a month including internet). Available for move in anytime between now and start of July. June is also FREE if moving in after the 4th. This is a lease takeover, with the lease lasting until May 4th 2025. 

\*\*About the apartment\*\* 

Modern apartment with 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. Your bathroom isn't en-suite but is about 1 yard from your bedroom door. Bedroom is spacious with comfortably enough room for a queen bed and furniture. There's also a built in closet. There is a washer/dryer in unit, dishwasher and central AC and heating. The apartment also has a balcony overlooking the courtyard. 

\*\*About the building\*\* 

Wisconsin Place is the best place I've ever lived. Very modern building, with great amenities including: in-building gym with new equipment, a cinema room, a cafe area with Macs, a rooftop pool and a business center with free printing. All are free to use for residents. The 24 hour reception is also super useful for making sure your packages and things are super safe. The building has an attached parking garage which it shares with a Whole Foods and Friendship Heights metro station. That means you are incredibly close to the metro and on humid/rainy days you don't even have to go outside to catch the red line downtown. The building has a 4.8 rating on Google, which is amazing for an apartment building, and honestly, I'd say that's accurate. 

\*\*The roommate\*\* 

Jason, my roommate, is staying on in the other room. He's great and one of the best roommates I've had. In his late 20s, works at a local university while also doing his master's there. You'll also be living with his labradoodle who is incredibly friendly and always down for sofa pets. 

\*\*Why I'm leaving\*\* 

My fiancee lives in Philly, and my work only requires me be in person Tue-Thu. So I'm only in town for at max two nights a week. The apartment is great, but I was never there. So moving somewhere that's more a \*bed and nothing else\*

17ed6rg,DC lease signing from afar - doing my due diligence [DC],"Greetings,

I'm a single female in my mid-thirties, relocating to DC for work from overseas. I find myself on a rather tight timeline to secure housing (most likely a studio), within the monthly price range of $1600 to $2300. Despite dedicating over a hundred hours to research, I'm aware that cities like DC are constantly evolving, rendering some of the information I've gathered outdated.

With that in mind, I kindly seek your advice as a local. Could you please recommend 1 to 2 neighborhoods or sub-neighborhoods that I should consider? I am particularly interested in areas with a community feel, that offer close proximity and easy access to safe parks and nature trails, efficient public transit to downtown, and quality grocery stores.

While I don't particularly enjoy clubbing, bar hopping, or loud neighbors at night, I do appreciate being able to walk home (relatively) safely after dark and attend the occasional intimate music or cultural performance in my neighborhood.

I am open to nearby suburbs in Virginia and Maryland as well. Your insights would be immensely valuable, and I am genuinely appreciative of your time and guidance.",2023,10

**Details:** 

* Rent: $700/month (averaging the past 12 months of utility and internet cost comes out to an additional $110/month for a total all-in average cost of $810/month)

Additional info: 

I've rented in Alexandria for 5+ years and this is one of the best finds out there in my cumulative experience--significantly under present rates today (which run close to $1,000 shared, or $1,700 for a studio), well-maintained, courteous roommates, nestled in a quiet Del Ray neighborhood and very safe at all hours of the day/night. Landlord is great and very responsive/flexible too and he and his family live right down the same street! 

About your roommates: 

Names are Rick and William. I’ve lived with the same roommates for 2+ years and they are solid guys; we all got along very well with each other. I have been living with them for over two years and enjoyed their company--even during COVID! We were all fairly on the quieter side. Both were very trustworthy, responsible, and respectable when it came to living together. They were certainly very solid roommates during a period where we all needed to work together to stay safe from COVID. 

**IF INTERESTED:**

qty2ur,$700 / 1br - Unbeatable $700/month (1 bd/shared bath) in shared 3 bd/2 bth townhome,"&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Amazing access, very safe, and walking distance (<15 min. away) to Braddock/King St. metro (blue/yellow), groceries, commuter bike trail, and historic Old Town. On-site parking.  


This is a 3-bedroom 2 bath townhome shared with two roommates-- Rick and William!  


Looking for someone who can take tenancy starting January 9th or sometime soon thereafter.  


**Details:**  


**Rent:** $700/month (averaging the past 12 months of utility and internet cost comes out to an additional $110/month for a total all-in average cost of $810/month)  


Room is unfurnished, but let me know what you’re looking for and I might be able to let go of some things for free or for a nominal cost  


**Security Deposit:** $700 (pet-friendly with an additional $150 security deposit)  


**Room details:** two-windowed corner-room; very well lit; room is \~150 sq ft room, shared bathroom, additional arts/hobby room next door and adjacent down the hall  


Central air conditioning and heating  


On-site parking in driveway  


Spacious backyard  


On-premise parking  


Shared kitchen appliances  


**Lease details:** 1 year lease, but if you need to leave early, Alan (the landlord) can sign a new lease with your replacement so you'd never need to worry with the stress of dealing with a subtenant or exit penalty.  


**Additional info:**  


I've rented in Alexandria for 5+ years and this is one of the best finds out there in my cumulative experience--significantly under present rates today (which run close to $1,000 shared, or $1,700 for a studio), well-maintained, courteous roommates, nestled in a quiet Del Ray neighborhood and very safe at all hours of the day/night. Landlord is great and very responsive/flexible too and he and his family live right down the same street!  


**About your roommates:**  


Names are Rick and William. I’ve lived with the same roommates for 2+ years and they are solid guys; we all got along very well with each other. I have been living with them for over two years and enjoyed their company--even during COVID! We were all fairly on the quieter side. Both were very trustworthy, responsible, and respectable when it came to living together. They were certainly very solid roommates during a period where we all needed to work together to stay safe from COVID.  


**IF INTERESTED:**

I will be moving to D.C. in July from the San Fransisco Bay Area. I have a 10 year old cat, her name is Meeka, who would be moving with me. 

&#x200B;

A little about me:   
I’m 22 year olds, queer, a massive history dork, and I am returning to D.C. for work. I love to cook and bake (but always clean up after myself) and would love to connect with my roommate(s) over a meal or baked good. I’m in the process of applying to law school, so that takes up most of my free time but I usually spend my down hours watching anime, listening to true crime podcasts, solving puzzles, and of course, trying new recipes. I’m pretty quiet and introverted but I don’t mind being social either, as hard as it is during the global pandemic. I am vaccinated and take wearing a mask outside very seriously. Ideally I would love to be friendly with my roommate(s) and have a positive and communication based relationship so we can all live together happily while having our needs and wants met.

I'm trying to figure out what neighborhoods would be best for my budget/commute. I'd love to be able to walk to work, but it feels like Navy Yard/SW Waterfront will stretch my budget. I'd love for bars/restaurants to be walkable, but it's not a big deal--it's more important that the area is safe. I have a car, but depending on where I end up living it's likely I'll sell it. What neighborhoods should I be looking at? Anyone ever lived in one of those fancy luxury buildings with all the amenities and was it worth it?

njhob4,Two bedroom available right across key bridge!,"Hey Everyone! 

If anyone is looking to move closer to Georgetown, Rosslyn, Courthouse area my apartment is available for rent. It takes two minutes to drive to Georgetown and is about a 5 minute walk to Courthouse area. I walk my dog everyday up to Clarendon and that takes less than 15 minutes.

I know it says 1 parking spot but its actually 2 and a private parking lot included. If no parking in the lot is available (which it always is) you are given a pass to park on the street. The zoning extends all the way up into Clarendon and Ballston so you can park up there for free as well. My electric usually runs about 40 dollars a month. Since its only 9 units its a really safe community and everyone knows each other. Super friendly neighbors and never had a problem.I loved it but unfortunately my dog is too big now and needs more room!

My girlfriend and I are hopefully moving to D.C. post-graduation and thus far, we're not having much luck finding a place to live. She starts her job in Alexandria May 26th and would really like to be settled around May 18th.

I'll most likely be working around Dupont, but I also have a car while she has to take a metro so I'm willing to drive a bit further if necessary. But for us, price is the biggest deal-breaker.

Bedrooms: 4Bathrooms: 2.5

Rent: $1050

Deposit: $1050

Utilities: Usually mostly covered by basement apartment credit (Average without is $85 a month)

Lease term: 1 year

Washer/Dryer: in house

Distance to metro: <5 minute walk.

Credit/Background Check: Required by Landlord ($35 fee)

3 rooms will be available on November 1st, 2019 in a 4 Bed 3 Bath row house just off Georgia Avenue. The house sits just a short 5 minute walk away from the Georgia Ave-Petworth Station. Safeway, CVS, and the great food options Georgia Avenue has to offer are all a short walk away. The neighborhood is very quiet, pleasant and safe.

The house is three floors. The top two floors both have two bedrooms and a bathroom with the bottom floor being a shared spaced containing the living room, kitchen, a small bathroom, and a small sun room. Both rooms on the second floor and one room on the third floor are available. The south facing second floor room comes with its own private sun room. The house is also PoC and LGBTQ+ friendly.

The house works on a group lease with each person paying 1/4th of the rent each month. Rent for the next lease will be 1050 each. The house has a (recently vacated but hopefully filled soon) separate basement apartment which shares a backyard with us. The city sends a credit for this apartment which usually covers most or all of the utilities for the month. 

I'm ideally looking for 3 other responsible young professionals who would be willing to sign a 1 year lease with me for the house. The landlord requires an application process which costs $35 to do a credit and background check. The first month's rent and the security deposit will be due on November 1st. Unfortunately due to the group lease the start date of the lease is not flexible.

Hi there! We are a couple looking for 2 roommates to share a house that we are renting in DC starting on the first of October. We are both professionals with full time careers and we are looking for the same in roommates. We have lived together for 2 years now and are coming from a very successful living situation in Silver Spring where we had 2 other people in a nice house, we are just looking to move into the city. We are 25-30 and are looking for roommates in the same general age range =)

The neighborhood is pretty amazing. Its a small walk to the metro or a straight shot on the bus, it wouldn't take more than 15 minutes to get to the metro. There is street parking available, and from what we saw, it wasn't ridiculously crowded. We were able to easily find spots each time we went by the house. Bottom line is that the neighborhood felt safe and definitely isn't ghetto. Also, Rock Creek Park is literally within seeing distance. You cross 2 streets and you are in the park on amazing running/hiking trails and the tennis center is right there as well.

There are 2 rooms and an Au Pair suite available for rent. The 2 rooms are joined (normal for a house this old, built in 1908! Dont worry, its been updated =P), but there is a door that can be locked. They are HUGE rooms, and if someone wanted both, that could possibly be worked out. The rooms could potentially share a bathroom, but if one person took both they would have a private bathroom. The suite, however, is completely self sufficient containing a kitchenette and private bathroom and is located on the top floor. All of the these spaces can easily accommodate large beds with multiple pieces of furniture and still feel roomy. 

We asked about utilities and were told that its about 200 for electric in the summer and about 200 for gas in the winter (depending on usage of course), so nothing crazy. All utilities are split evenly amongst the roommates. Internet is 150/150Mb download/upload speed, so even if everyone is streaming, it won't be an issue. If anyone wants additional services like TV or home phone, that would be paid by the people interested in those services. We don't want TV, so would not be paying a portion of the TV part of the bill. Obviously others in the house might want TV so you could all split that part of the bill. Also, I do IT for a living, so our networking and wireless will be top notch. You don't have to worry about slow downloads or poor quality while streaming netflix =D

There is a great backyard with a great deck for entertaining. It really is a rare thing to find a yard this nice in the city. There are many flower beds and we encourage people to use them if they so desire =) We will be growing seasonal veggies! There is a nice grill that is available for everyone to use as well as deck furniture. 

There is a pretty big basement for storage and also a garage that a few things can be stored in. We will have our cars in the garage, so space may be limited, but if there is room, we can work it out =)

We are looking for roommates who can pay their rent on time, be courteous to all who live there, and be moderately neat. We are not looking for OCD clean, but if you could not leave your dishes in the sink in an attempt to grow mini civilizations of life forms that'd be great.

Finally, there are 2 adorable dogs that live with us but sadly we are not looking for another. Perfect if you are a dog person who just doesn't have their puppy to love. Bella is a trained service dog (I trained dogs in the Army) and Bentley is a puppy that I was fostering and decided to keep.
We are open to male, female, and are LGBT friendly (Its crazy that I even need to say this).

The commute to The city is less than five miles away and access to the city is easy both driving and using metro.

More about the apartment, in our building we have both a fitness center and laundry facilities, and the pool is at the corner. The rent is $850 with all utilities included - wifi is already installed and the bill comes out to ~20 a person / month. The apartment is furnished with a dining room table and chairs, a sectional couch , coffee table , tv and tv stand. So there really isn't much room for more. The room is unfurnished. The kitchen is stocked with pots , pans etc. but there is room for some more items.  The bathroom is shared.   About us: we are both in our mid twenties, and work a 9-5 schedule. Very laid back.

We've started looking around for apartments, mostly to get a feel for the area, figure out what part of town we want to live in, etc. I have a few questions, and any help would be greatly appreciated.

1. How far in advance should I start looking for an apartment (1 br)? Reaching out to any posts right now seems very pre-mature, but I don't want to get caught with my pants down.

2. Can anyone recommend any apartment buildings, management companies, etc, to check out?

4msa0g,Man and his cat looking to move to NW DC July 1,"My roommate's headed back to North Carolina July 1 and after realizing I spend more than $100 on cabs and Ubers to and from NW DC per month, I figure it's time to be where my friends are, preferably in Petworth or CoHi, but anywhere NW DC will do! In the past 2 weeks I've discovered that Craigslist is like 80% scammers at this point and in the past 2 hours I've discovered that there alternatives to Craigslist! Cool!

I'm 31 and have been in DC for 7 years. I work as a copy editor and social media liaison for a nonprofit in Rockville, MD.

I enjoy hanging out with my friends, watching dumb movies, and making cocktails.I keep shared living spaces clean and very much as I left them. I'm positive to a fault, very friendly, and outgoing to a point, though there are some days when I'll be most interested in recharging at home, due to my conflicting introverted and extroverted tendencies.

I have a friendly, lazy, spry 14-year-old cat who would be making the move with me. She has no health issues and, though it would not have been my choice, my mom had her declawed as a kitten, so furniture is safe around her. She's very attached to me but has warmed up to others since living with roommates!

I'd be willing to pay up to $1000, slightly more if the room or location are worth it.",2016,06

I'm looking to find a place that is safe, affordable and allows me to get around easily on foot or with public transportation, especially to Foggy Bottom. Nova is fine so long as it doesn't feel too suburban - I need to feel like I am living in a city. 


About me: Quiet but with a sense of humor. I don't drink or smoke. I rarely have people over because I'd rather catch up with friends over coffee or dinner at a restaurant. If I am sharing an apartment, I'd prefer a roommate who feels the same - I've lived with people who constantly have people over and that is so not for me. I'm very considerate and need to have a roommate who is the same way.  

  
The cat? She's very relaxed, just eats and sleeps and is very friendly. However, I'm noticing that a lot of rentals in DC say ""no pets,"" so I'm putting it front and center that the cat comes with.  


I'm looking to move in mid-August. Early, I know, but I figured it couldn't hurt to start looking now.

I'm hoping to keep it under $1,000, but can go up to $1,300 for the absolute perfect place. I'd prefer to find my own place, but given my budget I know that I can probably afford only a share.",2013,06

4md7uw,Pit Bull Friendly Housing in Metro area,"We currently live in Fort Totten, walking distance to the metro, $1150 a month. However, the building is a bit older, the neighborhood, while safe, is somewhat dirty, has a lot of alcoholics who drink outside all day and yell at me, and other tenants in my building treat my boyfriend and I (mid 20's, clean, professional, both work government jobs) like garbage because we have a Pit Bull. He has never once barked, gone after anyone or been aggressive in anyway. The only people who are kind to us are the neighbors with 3 sons under the age of 10 who all play with our dog regularly.  Other than the neighbors, it's not terrible. We have a yard, laundry in building, we dont pay utilities. 

I guess Im asking if anyone knows of any housing that has a pit bull friendly policy? Our budget is up to 1400 or so, and I don't have a car, so I would prefer walking distance to metro.

1ieety,Some questions about finding housing in D.C.,"Hey y'all
I plan to move to D.C. in the next few weeks for graduate school and have come across some strange details in classified postings that leave me baffled. I'm currently living in the South but am by no means a Southern hick; I'm curious as to why some of the housing opportunities are so restrictive.

Why is it that there are so many people who will only accept gay (or specifically, black gay) room mates? I've come across so many ads specifically limiting housing to non-straight males. I've never seen that before.

Along with that, I don't smoke but I've seen countless ads requesting Non-Smokers only. Is smoking indoors a huge problem in D.C.? It seems strange to me that folks would be so explicit about something like that. Where I'm from, people tend to keep their bad habits outdoors where it won't bother anybody.

Rent prices. I am honestly curious how people can afford $1200/mo rent for apartments in ""transition"" neighborhoods. I'm looking to settle into a $700/mo shoebox in Petworth because that is the absolute max i can afford but are jobs just so lucrative in our nations capital that +$1000 is nothing? 

Crime. The crime maps suggest that having your car broken into and being mugged are not uncommon. Why is this? What can you do (aside from don't attract attention to yourself) to avoid being a victim? I'm genuinely curious.

Where do all the house shows happen? I haven't found many basements in my search. Are basement shows a thing in D.C.?

Thanks for taking the time for reading this.",2013,07
50hbec,Looking for 2 roommates for house share in Silver Spring (inside beltway),"http://washingtondc.craigslist.org/mld/roo/5759227402.html

Hi there! We are a couple looking for a 3rd and 4th roommate. We are both professionals who have full time careers and have been living together for 2 years now. Our current roommates have decided to move out so we have a couple of rooms available. We are aged 25-31 and looking for a roommate in the same general age range =)

We are located in a quiet neighborhood with lots of running/biking trails within walking distance. There has been no crime since we have lived here. There are no cars on blocks and no bars on windows. It's a great little place to live.

The rooms for rent are upstairs and would share a large bathroom. The first one has a HUGE walk in closet with lots of closet hardware for easy storage. This room is approximately 17x12 and has plenty of room for your furniture and can easily fit a king size bed, although I have found that a queen is the best fit. This room is going for 850 a month

The other room is slightly smaller at 15x11 and has 2 huge closets on one wall. The bed in the picture is a queen for reference. There is also a desk in the room as well as a night stand on the other side of the bed. This room is going for 800 a month. 

These rooms would share the bathroom pictured, however it is a LARGE bathroom with lots of storage including separate storage on either side of the sink and a large closet. 

The utilities (water and electric) are about 300~ a month, depending on usage and will be split evenly among the 4 tenants. Internet is 99 a month (to be split amongst everyone) for 150/150Mb download/upload speed, so even if everyone is streaming, it won't be an issue. If anyone wants additional services like TV or home phone, that would be paid by the people interested in those services. I don't want TV, so would not be paying a portion of the TV part of the bill. Obviously others in the house might want TV so you could all split that part of the bill.

The house has a great backyard with a brand new deck, perfect for BBQ's and just hanging out. The house is also fully wired for networking, so no one has to go with ""just"" Wi-Fi, although our Wi-Fi is awesome because that's what I do for a living, and I only use the best equipment. The kitchen is HUGE with lots of counter space and LOTS of storage, so everyone should have room for their stuff.

We are looking for roommates who can pay their rent on time, be courteous to all who live there, and be moderately neat. We aren't looking for OCD clean, but if you could not leave your dishes in the sink in an attempt to grow mini civilizations of life forms that'd be great.

4z0owk,Looking for 2 roommates for house share in Silver Spring (inside the beltway),"Hi there! We are a couple looking for a 3rd and 4th roommate. We are both professionals who have full time careers and have been living together for 2 years now. Our current roommates have decided to move out so we have a couple of rooms available. We are aged 25-31 and looking for a roommate in the same general age range =)

We are located in a quiet neighborhood with lots of running/biking trails within walking distance. There has been no crime since we have lived here. There are no cars on blocks and no bars on windows. It's a great little place to live.

The rooms for rent are upstairs and would share a large bathroom. The first one has a HUGE walk in closet with lots of closet hardware for easy storage. This room is approximately 17x12 and has plenty of room for your furniture and can easily fit a king size bed, although I have found that a queen is the best fit. This room is going for 900 a month

The other room is slightly smaller at 15x11 and has 2 huge closets on one wall. The bed in the picture is a queen for reference. There is also a desk in the room as well as a night stand on the other side of the bed. This room is going for 850 a month. 

These rooms would share the bathroom pictured, however it is a LARGE bathroom with lots of storage including separate storage on either side of the sink and a large closet. 

The utilities (water and electric) are about 300~ a month, depending on usage and will be split evenly among the 4 tenants. Internet is 99 a month (to be split amongst everyone) for 150/150Mb download/upload speed, so even if everyone is steaming, it won't be an issue. If anyone wants additional services like TV or home phone, that would be paid by the people interested in those services. I don't want TV, so would not be paying a portion of the TV part of the bill. Obviously others in the house might want TV so you could all split that part of the bill.

The house has a great backyard with a brand new deck, perfect for BBQ's and just hanging out. The house is also fully wired for networking, so no one has to go with ""just"" Wi-Fi, although our Wi-Fi is awesome because that's what I do for a living, and I only use the best equipment. The kitchen is HUGE with lots of counter space and LOTS of storage, so everyone should have room for their stuff.

3cgi4y,"1 BR Available in Brookland house, Blocks from Red Line and Catholic University, Aug 1st $1100 + utilities","*Note: Please PM me if interested. Check out the CL post for pics: https://washingtondc.craigslist.org/doc/roo/5108681428.html*

The room:

The enormous master bedroom is essentially two rooms, a larger L-shaped space (currently used as a home office/yoga spot/extra couch space) and a sun room. The sunroom has a huge closet with full length mirrors, and enough space for a large bed. Ceiling fans in both rooms make the summer months more pleasant, and the rooms get lots of light.

The rooms are at the back of the house, so noise from the street, living room, and front porch generally doesn't carry.

Rent is $1100 not including utilities or internet.

The house:

The second floor includes the master bedroom, a smaller bedroom, and a spacious bathroom with a jacuzzi.

The first floor has a living room (complete with TV, couch, heated table for the winter months, and decorative fireplace), dining room, bedroom with half-bath, and kitchen. The kitchen has marble countertops, a gas stove, and a dishwasher. We have lots of shared spices and kitchen equipment.

The basement has a bedroom, another full bath, and a washer/dryer. There is also some storage space, currently used for suitcases. If you are a bicyclist, there is plenty of room for another bike in the house.

The backyard is mostly gravel, which makes maintenance fairly easy. There are two grills and a table, great for barbeques or morning coffee. It is fenced and secure.

The front porch includes more seating and a small herb garden.

The neighborhood:

This house is located about a half mile from the Brookland-Catholic University Metro Station. It is just off Monroe, which is one of the main roads of the neighborhood, but it is a very quiet street with lots of parking space.

The metro is five blocks away, a 10 minute brisk walk or a 15 minute stroll. For those attending Catholic University, it should be about a 15 minute walk to get to the edge of campus from this location.

Our home is close to the restaurants on 12th Street, which has a CVS, Capital Bikeshare, a post office, a hardware store, and many restaurants such as Menomale, Brookland Pint, Brookland's Finest, and Steel Plate. We have a couple of great local breakfast places/cafes (Murray and Paul's, Askale Cafe) as well as Z Pizza, Potbelly's, and Busboy and Poets. For those who like to run, swim, lift weights, play basketball/baseball, and more, Turkey Thicket Recreation Center is right next to the metro station.

Yes Organic is about a 20-minute walk. Giant, the nearest full sized grocery store, is at the Rhode Island Ave Metro, which is about a 25 minute walk or a 10 minute bike ride.

There are many transportation options to every part of the DC area. Brookland is on the red line, which takes you directly downtown or up towards Silver Spring. It is also one stop away from Ft. Totten, which connects to the yellow and green line. Bus lines also connect you to downtown DC, Tenleytown in NW DC, PG Plaza in Maryland, and more.

Your roommates:

Roommate number one works as a librarian in DC and specializes in multimedia education, audio storytelling, and community engagement. She is the proud owner of the house's curious cat, and she enjoys binge watching Frazier, Bob's Burgers, and the Simpsons. The house smells divine whenever she's cooking anything.

Roommate number two works in the restaurant industry at night and does freelance videography and video editing. He likes to play guitar, watch movies, drink coffee, and bother the cat. He often bakes bread in the noisy bread machine, and he drinks a beer with the cat to relax.

Roommate number three moved to this home from an urban kibbutz of sorts. She is a daytime government worker and nighttime master's student, so she spends a lot of time studying. Actually, some of the ""studying"" time is spent reading crime fiction, and some of it is spent watching Foyle's War, but a bit is legit studying! She also enjoys playing guitar, going for walks, and eating delicious bread from the bread machine. Roommates two and three are a couple.

Generally speaking, we are a quiet house, and we keep noise and activity down after about 10 pm. In order to economize, we try to keep the house cool in the winter and warm in the summer.

Languages spoken in the household: English, Russian, Spanish, Chinese, Japanese.

Seeking:

Looking for a clean and courteous roommate. We are looking for a non-smoker, and we have a policy of no drug use in our home.

Under our lease terms, we are only able to accept one person, and we are not able to accept any more pets. Our fat cat is very friendly and loves to snuggle, but he'll also keep away from you if you're not a cat person. The basement is a cat-free zone. If you don't want Mr. Cat in your room, just keep the door closed. He has not been in the master bedroom, so it is currently cat-free.

The three of us all cook frequently, but we're generally great about sharing kitchen space and pretty finicky about keeping it clean. You'd be welcome to cook all the time, and even join our awesome CSA. If you'd rather not cook at all, that's also ok.

House responsibilities are fairly standard. We have some yard maintenance (pretty seasonal) and help each other keep the house clean. In our house, we have a monthly house meeting/meal to discuss little things that come up, to organize house cleaning and maintenance, and get the utility bills properly divided. A couple of us are open to sharing more food/cooking than we currently do if that's something that might interest you. ",2015,07

Really great deal, the best I could find in the area.

* Shared laundry in a basement (at least it's on site?) 
* Sometimes can hear people upstairs (1st floor apartment)
* Older building
* No counter space in the kitchen, but it's more than large enough to have a kitchen island and a kitchen table. 
* Small bathroom

Positives:

* High ceilings with large, bright windows
* Friendly neighbors
* Real hardwood floors
* Large rooms (besides bathroom)
* Quiet street
* Well maintained - didn't have a single issue upon move in
* No bars over the windows even though it's a 1st floor due to how raised it is off the ground level
* Older building (some people like older, some don't)
* Block away from the metro and all the restaurants on Connecticut

33vo9m,Looking for a room in DC? How about one on the Red Line for $850/month,"Available May 12, flexible to May 7:
We’re seeking someone or someone(s) to take over our wonderful space in the Connecticut Heights Apartments. This room is ideal for one or two summer interns looking to move in Mid-May (flexible even from May 7) and looking to stay until the end of July. This corner room has two big windows facing west and north, comfortable fits two twin beds and large furniture, like a desk, dresser, side tables, etc. The full bath you would share with your immediate roommate is right outside the bedroom door, and our other roommate has her own private bath . We are also willing to sell one twin bed, almost brand new, for $150 OBO, bedding for the said twin bed, an incredible futon for $175, and a 50” HD TV for $300. 
The apartment is carpeted, has a huge (emphasis on huge)  bright kitchen, especially considering the historic nature of our beautiful building. You have a closet in your room and additional storage in the foyer. The apartment is right across the street from a church and church-run preschool. The neighborhood is safe and quiet, but still only a block and a half from Connecticut Ave and all the amenities it offers. M4 and L2 buses run two blocks away, and Van Ness UDC and Tenleytown metro stations are only a half mile away. 
We are willing to pro-rate the rent up until your move-in date, and we’ll even share the application fee ($350) with whoever moves in to help bear the brunt of the burden—split four ways for two roomies, and 3 ways for one. Remaining roommate is 420 friendly (however will not partake if you request her not to) and very chill, writer and enjoys going out on the weekends. The lease ends at the end of July, but you can resign for the room ($1250 for one person, $625 for two), if you decide you want to stay inside the beltway.
Utilities run about $50 a month, which is split either two or three ways. Cable and internet—including HBO and On Demand—runs $112 a month, which will also be split either two or three ways . 
There is parking, but we aren’t quite sure about fees because we just love walking around our beautiful neighborhood.
Apartment Amenities:
 Air Conditioning, Capital Bikeshare, Indoor and Outdoor swimming pool, tennis court, 24-hour concierge, 24-hour fitness center, key fob access, laundry facilities on each floor, package service, valet dry cleaning service, free wifi in lobby. 
If interested, please share a bit about yourself, what you will be doing in DC, and any questions.

277mku,"3 rooms for rent in Burke townhouse. $630.00,$465.00 and $390.00 + utilities. Available July 1st.","Hey!

I am looking to fill 3 rooms in the townhouse I am currently renting in Burke, VA. My roommates have found jobs in other areas and are moving out, but I really like it here and would like to stay! The rooms vary by size and the rent reflects that. 

Room 1: Basement ($630) - huge room. Has a private half-bathroom and a full fridge. The full-bathroom located on the 2nd floor is also available for you to use. Direct access to laundry and dryer units, which are shared with other housemates. Not the typical basement room -- plenty of natural sunlight, as there is a sliding door leading to the patio and backyard (could even be used as a private entrance). 

Room 2: Standard ($465) - Located on the 2nd floor. Shared full bathroom (also on 2nd floor) with 2 housemates and shared half bathroom (on 1st floor). Has a window and a standard-sized closet. Can fit a full or queen-sized bed. 

Room 3: Small ($390) - Although the room is small, it comes furnished with a full-sized bed, pillows, and comforter set (can all be removed if you don't want it), and a lamp. Has room for a small computer table and a dresser. Has a window and a small closet. 

More about me: I am a 28 year old male. I work in the mortgage industry out in Tyson's Corner. I like spending time outdoors, playing Xbox, reading, and watching Netflix. Really easy-going and low maintenance housemate. 

More about the area: Quiet, safe neighborhood located 20 minutes outside of DC. Plenty of parking right outside the townhouse. Cats are welcome! Lots of young professionals and families in the neighborhood. Access to community pool, tennis courts, and basketball courts. Close to GMU, I-495, VRE bus, and several Metro stations. 

I think that's about it -- let me know if you have any questions! I'm available to show the rooms this upcoming weekend, need commitment by June 10th for July 1st move-in. May be able to negotiate an earlier move-in.

I've been at this house for a year and am renewing and my boyfriend is moving in, so we will be taking up 2 of the 4 bedrooms and we have 2 bedrooms open. It's been a group house for a long time so it's not sparkling new but it's got charm, is sunny and spacious, and an 8 minute walk to the takoma metro/20 mins to downtown. One bedroom connects to the (unfinished) attic, both have a/c and look out over the front yard and have high ceilings and lots of natural light. 

pros:
-friendly roomies who cook constantly (seriously, my boyfriend is a chef. we always have tons of food cooking or in the fridge and love to cook for others!)
-lots of natural light
-hardwood floors
-close to metro
-front and back porch. back patio looks over a 2 car driveway
-we also sublet out the basement occasionally for $400 so that knocks a hundred off our rent
-420 and booze friendly, no smoke in the house though
-we are pretty nerdy types (game of thrones sundays are a must, and I have a harry potter tattoo) but also love the outdoors and going to live sports games. 

cons:
-no central air or heat :( we do have a/c in the bedrooms for rent and tons of fans and space heaters and it hasn't been a problem for me
-like I said, it's been a group house for a while so the house isn't brand new but the landlady is painting the house before y'all would move in 

not sure if pro or con:
-I do have a cat that hates other animals with the fire of a thousand suns, so unfortunately no other four legged critters can be welcome but he is super friendly and awesome.
-we work in the restaurant industry so we tend to get home/stay up late but are quiet and respectful of others' bedtimes!

The landlady lives in NYC but is friendly and on top of getting things fixed. she does a credit/job check and requires a sec deposit and first month's rent.

Takoma is a great little town on the dc/md border, there's tons of cute little shops and a farmer's market. We're a ten minute walk from the Safeway and the Quarry House (great bar in Silver Spring) is half a mile walk away. Super safe and friendly neighborhood.

utilities not included, usually about 70-120 depending on the season. Year leases only. ",2013,08
24xg4f,Large Private Bedroom/Bath Available in Artsy 2br/2ba Row Home Apartment,"**Room**

In the shared apartment, situated in a prime Adams Morgan location, I have available to rent a large bedroom with a private hallway, private bath with a deep tub and wall mirror, porch and back entrance. The room will come unfurnished, but it is large enough to fit a queen or king sized bed with plenty of room to spare. French doors give the room a unique feel and offer the space plenty of light.


**Communal Space**

The living room and dining area is lovely large space with high ceilings - big bay windows, working fireplace and an exposed brick wall. The space is mostly furnished, but I would love to discuss more as there is room. All the floors of the apartment are wooden. I have a large vinyl record and book collection I would be happy to share and my artwork does cover the walls (and some floor space!) The kitchen comes stocked but there will be room for your items. Garbage disposal and dishwasher. Included is a washer/dryer in unit and central air. Plenty of storage space available as well.

**Utilities**

Included in rent is water and trash. Not included is electric and wifi, which I pay directly monthly and we will split. I do not have a television set, so there is currently no cable - but this could certainly be changed if you were interested.  


**The Neighborhood**	

The apartment is located in the heart of Adams Morgan, perfectly comfortable for a night in and even better situated for a night out - located a block away from the 18th street strip. A reason I love this apartment is because it's not centrally located in the noise and fuss of the main area of AdMo, but so close that everything is easily accessible by foot. Safe neighborhood with some gems close by - Tryst, the coffee shop/bar I can be found at after work (one of the highest rated in the city!), Idle time Books (a treasure of a used bookstore), the beautiful Meridian Hill Park and tons of the best boutiques, bars, yoga and restaurants in DC. There is a 24/7 Safeway and a Yes! Organic Market right up the street as well as a Harris Teeter. Next door to the famous Adams Morgan dog, Romo. You will also be about a short walk away from Woodley Park and the National Zoo, Dupont Circle, U St and Columbia Heights.

**Getting Around**

The red line metro is an 8 minute walk away at the Woodley Park Metro, and Dupont Circle metro is also walk or bus accessible. The green/yellow line is also easily accessible by walking or bus at the Columbia Heights Metro. The L2, 90, 96 and the Circulator bus stop is situated right in front of our door! Around the corner you can catch the 42 and the 43. Also, right across the street is a capital bikeshare station from where you can rent bikes. This is one of the most well connected streets in the area.

**About Me**	

You will be sharing the apartment with me, a 28 year old female originally from Brooklyn NY. I have lived in the apartment for almost 3 years and it is my home. I am a property manager for a subsidized apartment building /soup kitchen for low income senior citizens and I also am a freelance artist. I am looking for someone in their late 20s-early 30s, non-smoker, lgbt friendly, who doesn't like to party in house but the occasional dinner party and brunch is great, semi decently clean (hell, I am not perfect) and who must be okay with me doing my art in the apartment. I would like someone who would want to make it a home as well.

**Available June 1st.**

1k18nf,2 BR available around Sept 1 in Capitol Hill,"I have two bedrooms available in a 3 BR/1 bath condominium, located at 14th and A St SE. It's five blocks from the Stadium-Armory metro, eight blocks from H St NE, and eight blocks from RFK Stadium. The neighborhood is very safe and respectful, and I have thoroughly enjoyed the last year I've lived here.

About me: I am a twenty-four year old male who works at a restaurant down by the Navy Yard. My free time generally involves going to DC United games (season ticket holder), going out to concerts, or going to H St for drinks.

About you: You should be of a similar level in the game of life. As long as you are clean and you can pay the rent on time then we will probably get along fine. Currently my working hours are generally 4 to close so if you have a F/T job then we would be at the house at different times of the day anyways.

The rooms are $800 each per month plus utilities, which would probably be another $75-90. A security deposit of $800 is also expected up front by my landlord as well. Pets are currently a no-go. Smokers are fine as long as they do it away from the house. A family with two young children live on the second floor and I don't want to upset them over stupid stuff like that. There are two off-street parking spaces in the back so you don't have to worry about street parking. If you do get your car registered in DC, it's Zone 6 parking, which is massive. It goes all the way from north of the Verizon Center all the way down to Southwest/Nats Park. The little things. 

I'm currently showing the house on Saturday (the 10th) from 12 to around 4-ish. If you are interested in coming at a specific time just e-mail me and I will see what's available time-wise. I am working tonight so if you don't get a response immediately, that's why. People coming in pairs will be given priority.

Talk to you all soon. -- Kevin
