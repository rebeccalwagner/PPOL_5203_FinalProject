Nobody believed me when I said the open drinking and tolerance of asocial behavior mattered.

Yet today we see the attemped lynching of a southeast Asian Man in the streets of DC, simply for the crime of recording people's illegal activity. 



We were told that we needed to take cops out of the schools, to defund the policy, to no longer enforce school discipline.

We gave high school diplomas to people who can't read, we gave free homes and phones to criminals, and we gave drug dealers free apartments in the nicest apartments in DC.


The result? People are using their free apartments and vouchers for easy access to U-Street, where they hunt and beat up hard working Desis who are working nonstop for Uber just to put food on their table.

How is it that our tax system rewards people who know how to ""work the system"" and get welfare while someone who drives uber for 12/hr can't get shit?

How is it that people working for nonprofits don't get housing vouchers, but people who deal drugs can hang out in their baby momma's crib and smoke weed nonstop without ever getting kicked out of the complex?

How is it that our politicians and cops won't step up and enforce the laws on the books when it comes to Chinatown and U-Street?

It makes me sad that there used to be a vibrant black middle class that my family was a part of, and now I feel terrorized by these goons that wreck havoc on U-Street from 10pm-3am every single night, twerking in front of metro busses and threatening anyone that is asian.

1ekm37q,Is there something in the water? The air? ,"Or are people that live in this city just naturally predisposed to anger and violence? I live in NoMa, which I really think is a great neighborhood with a lot going for it. But just in the latter half of last week and this weekend, the simmer of rage and violence has spiked. 

First during the week it was an angry woman barging through people going the opposite direction up the metro stop stairs, yelling insults the whole way up. Then on the extreme end of the spectrum was that senseless shooting in a crowded area Friday night. Then a more tame but still no less bizarre incident, I saw some tantrum-throwing teenager kicked a random passerby for walking near them while they were having a meltdown in front of their parent (?) Sunday evening. 

All this at once really jam-packs the NoMa experience into a weekend, but it’s been like this since I’ve lived here: disobedient kids publicly fighting with their weak parents, people having mental health crises on the street, random acts of gun violence, and fight after fight late into the evening. 

What the fuck?

What kind of city do we live in? I’ve been here for a few years and am now only recently reflecting on if I should consider this normal, par for the course of living in a major city. I don’t necessarily feel unsafe, but I do think that some people feel too safe being their violent selves in and to the public.

I've worked for everything I've got. Babysat in high school, couldn't afford to go to a private college even with good ACT scores, couldn't afford to study abroad. First in my family to go to college. 

Even pulling myself out of poverty against the odds, there is an attitude in DC of helping the people who only want chaos. 

When I was in middle school, there were a lot of kids who wouldn't do their homework, and disrupted the class. When I was really young they were still sent out of class, but by the time I got to high school they could remain in class even if they were cursing out the teacher. 

In college, they chose to skip class and get along with sub-par grades, or dropped out. But in DC it seems like the people who never woke up on time, never turned in their homework, and want to smoke weed at Chinatown Metro and drink lean are the ones being protected, not me.

We all know about J-Money and the people who play illegally loud music, and the people who drive dangerously enough to paralyze or kill every single day. 

Yet when it is brought up to public officials, they want to blame the people who pick up trash, not people who litter. They blame people on bikes for traffic deaths, when thousands of people drive with suspended licenses and thousands of tickets. 

Not all DC natives are like this, but for those who are, we shouldn't mollycoddle them when their attitude is the problem. 

Nowhere else in the country would it be acceptable to drive 40+ mph in the city. 


In Virginia, if you are going over 80 mph or 20+ over the limit, it can be a felony. Yet in DC Brianne Nadeau wants to forgive the speeding tickets of those who kill my friends and make me afraid to cross the street on NY and FL Ave. 

On Metro my female friends are afraid to go out at night, and my East Asian friends get shithead teens making ""squinty eyes"" at Mt. Vernon, just because of the color of their skin. The schools and police do nothing even if they yell slurs when they are loitering and harassing paying passengers on metro. 

I grew up dirt poor, and never used racial slurs. Never used the N word. But there is a certain group of """"DC Natives"""" who think it is okay to work under the table, cause chaos in U street, and harass anyone born between Turkey and Thailand with evil racist remarks. 

Just for being a productive member of society. 

I do think some people in DC haven't gotten a fair shake, but I will not give an inch critiquing the """"DC Natives"""" who take advantage of productive members of society, who gamble in the street, who twerk on cop cars, who ride ATVs down 14th street on the sidewalk.

Every week there's more crazy shit happening in areas you would never expect, I mean an ""attempted carjacking"" outside of the Library of Congress last night where Capitol Police are a block away? Diplomats and Congress people are getting carjacked in Navy Yard? Criminals now arming themselves with rifles and robbing people for their iPhones while traveling in stolen minivans? An ambulance and a cop car jacked in the span of a week? What the fuck is going on with our city?

I've lived here my entire life apart from college. I am 40 years old. Never in my life (even in the 90's when it was bad) have I felt so unsafe. 

Every week it continues to get worse and worse and our council doesn't do a single thing. They just look away and either deny that there's a problem or they refuse to actually help. How is providing free air tags and now giving out pepper spray for free going to stop your car from getting jacked? 

I've tried to not pay attention to what's going on but even when I'm just around this city  I see antisocial and disgusting behaviors from people here. Homeless and drug addicts yelling and screaming / threatening passer bys, people shoplifting stupid shit, people driving insane and blowing through red lights speeding 50 mph in a 20, juveniles fighting with each other and random victims. It just feels like nobody here gives a fuck about anything anymore. There's no order at all in this city anymore. 

Law abiding citizens like us are the victims of this failure and nobody ever gives out a productive conversation on how to fix this OR puts anything to action. It's all just blaming politicians or parents or whatever they can use as a strawman. This entire city needs a major overhaul at this point because it's just a dumpster fire.

17g2urb,Xpost: Just was robbed at gunpoint at Takoma Park,"Good morning. My initial post was locked in the main subreddit. 

""Hey all.

Just wanted to get this off my chest. At approx. 9:30. I was sitting outside my friends house in Takoma Park on Poplar Ave in my Mini Cooper trying to get my car's navigation to work. A car rolled up, 3 teens got out and knocked on my window, and they proceeded to rob me at gunpoint. The took my phone, wallet and my backpack which had my ear buds in them. Funnily enough, they wanted to take the car too but when I told them it was a manual and that they ""didn't know how to drive one"" they relented.

I got smacked around a bit but I am ok. I am very frustrated and clearly, even in a nice neighborhood, you need to watch out.

Be careful out there yall.""

EDIT:

My lessons learned:

1) Do not assume you are safe. If you are in the DMV area, you are a potential target. I don't care if you are in the hood or the swankiest part of Georgetown. You are always a potential target. This is especially true if you own a car.

2) Do not idle in you car...ever. The reason they got me was because I was fiddling around with my console, not paying attention and not moving. As soon as you walk to your car, you need to have everything you need( such as your GPS) ready to go. If something fails, you should have a backup that is easy to access.

3) Everything that deals with any of your financial information should have an additional password / pin. My assailants made me unlock my phone before they left. My Venmo / Zelle accounts had no additional protection. Make sure you have pins and facial recognition on for everything important.

4) Have back ups for important identifying documents. I was lucky that I had an old valid drivers license and a passport sitting around. Getting my life back together would have been much more difficult if I didn't. Having a spare license is a great idea. Giving a friend or family a spare set of keys is also a great idea incase someone steals your keys.

5) Have trackers on everything. The more discreet, the better. Your car should have an air tag in it somewhere. Likewise for your wallet / purse and keys. The more ways you have to track your belongings, the better chances the bad guys get caught.

Anyway, thank all of you for your kind words. It helped me get through this.

Stay safe out there.",2023,10

With that comes more controversial points of view which I don't think are racist but more practical (being a white person wanting to live in the more white neighborhood for the simple reason of crime statistics) but could be depending on how the person really feels deep down inside

1aerk5y,A skyrocketing rate of carjacking and murder is not a normal part of city life,"Am I going crazy? For background I have lived in various big cities for all my adult life and (until recently) have almost never felt unsafe. I’m quite liberal. I hate when suburbanites and/or conservatives fearmonger about how “dangerous” cities are - calm down, when a lot of people live together, crime is statistically inevitable. Whether it’s on Fox News or seemingly every big city subreddit, the fearmongering is annoying and usually wrong. I’m sure many residents of DC share my general inclinations on this type of thing.

HAVING SAID ALL THAT. In this case, DC is **actually having a severe crime problem.** It’s not about perception or politics, the numbers are enough. In 2023, there were 274 homicides in DC – a 36% increase from the previous year and the highest in 26 years!!! Carjackings DOUBLED in one year, including a member of Congress!

Last night a man was carjacked and murdered in NoMa/Union Market in front of new luxury apartments where studios lease for over 2k a month. The crime is also spreading to previously safe areas in Northwest and it doesn’t seem like any neighborhood is a refuge anymore. I fear that I or someone I know will inevitably be next for a robbery, assault, carjacking, or worse.

When I try to have conversations with people about the crime crisis, including this morning, I hear “yeah it’s awful! scary” and then they don’t want to discuss it anymore. (The other sub doesn’t even let us talk about it!) Why won’t anyone speak up to how messed up and unacceptable this is, and do something?",2024,01
1d474to,Have any of you ever considered simply moving out of DC?,"Considering most of you have a victim fetish and act as if you live in a war zone, that’ll probably be your best bet. The way you weirdos fetishize crime, I’m fully convinced you would hate it if there was no crime, because otherwise you would have nothing to anonymously rant about. Newsflash people, you live in the nations capital, not in 2005 bagdad. Most homicide victims are known by the perpetrator. Most shootings are gang related. They are not targeting innocent people like you and killing them in the streets like it’s the French Revolution. Please take time to revaluate your lives. Dc is one of the most expensive places to live in, if you’re so concerned about crime consider moving out. 

When does it get old to you? Why don’t you all just get your overlord u/BackgroundPatient1 and create a new sub where you can discuss things like:

“Bowser is incentivizing crime! She refuses to punish criminals!” 

“All these voucher holders are mostly drug dealing thugs”

“OMG! Today I heard my first gunshots, it sounded like an AK-47!”

“These moped riders must be those immigrants that were brought over from the Texas border!”

I wish I can say I am exaggerating but these are common topics found in a lot of these posts. Have none of you ever taken a 200 level EDUC course in college? It’s not rocket science, it’s pretty simple to understand the background behind crime and violence in urban environments. This is not limited to DC like you would like to believe, this is common in all cities. DC isn’t even in the top 10 worst cities when it comes to crime. You’re not victims, you are onlookers. It’s like attending the Coliseum and complaining about violent battles between gladiators. None of you are victims of crime, and don’t come to the comments and talk about the time “you witnessed teenagers rob an old lady in your neighborhood” as if it’s some right of passage. I’ve worked in the city for years, I’ve commuted by bike and scooter at night time. I passed U street everyday on my way from work on a scooter for a year, and I have NEVER felt unsafe or witnessed any crime what’s so ever. Stop looking for reasons to feel victimized. Most of you are delusional. 

A lot of you people will blatantly deny the toxicity of this sub, but I can show you countless examples of racist comments that have gained upvotes, it’s 2024 and you people drool over someone commenting “dindun nuffin”. A man should never say something behind someone’s back that they’re afraid to say in their face. That’s something that teenage girls do when the want to gossip. Please grow a fucking spine. ",2024,05

A lot of things have improved over the years and if these people actually went outside instead of sitting behind their computer screens where they live 25 miles deep down in Virginia, they would actually realize the city isn’t the war zone that they claim it to be. I used to get off of work at night every day at Logan circle. I would hop on a bike or scooter and take it across U st to Howard U, then up Georgia ave all the way to uptown, and I have never been a victim of crime nor have I ever feared being a victim. DC has what I believe is the second largest police presence of any city in the country, and it’s completely safe. Crime is not a DC thing, it happens all over the country regardless of the city. Im convinced most of these posts are actually just expressions of racial microagressions rather than actual crime concerns. A place where people, probably out of towners who most likely came to DC after graduating college can come together and talk down on the long time inhabitants of the city.

17bcxz5,Safety in DC Vibe Check,"I lived in DC from 2012 to the end of 2021, and in many neighborhoods over the years - Petworth, H Street, Brookland, Adams Morgan, U Street. For most of that time I felt pretty safe overall as long as I abided by standard city-living safety precautions. Towards the end though there was this growing feeling of lawlessness. I witnessed a couple muggings, ATVs all over the city, gang-related crime was increasing and there were several pedestrians killed by stray gunfire in my area.

I've been living in a different country for the last two years but will be coming back to DC to live in December, and my wife and I will be having a kid soon.  From afar it seems like the issues I felt before have just been getting worse and worse (more carjackings, murders, robberies, etc.). But I'm not sure how much of that is just selection bias - in that the news and social media will always highlight the worst of the worst.

ALWAYS keep your doors locked and windows rolled up (if it’s hot and you don’t have air conditioning, roll them up at least part-way) no matter how short the distance you’re traveling or how safe the neighborhood.
Drive in the center lane to make it harder for potential carjackers to approach the car.
AVOID driving alone. Travel with someone whenever possible, especially at night.
When you are coming to a stop, leave enough room to maneuver around other cars, especially if you sense trouble and need to get away.
Always drive with the doors locked. If a thief can’t get in your vehicle, you stand a better chance of leaving with it.
DON’T stop to assist a stranger whose car has broken down. You can help instead by driving to the nearest phone (or using your cell phone) to call police for help.",2023,10
1e3k7ww,Foggy Bottom stalker again (case numbers),"I had more than one encounter tonight with the guy that has been following solo people in Foggy Bottom. 

I was heading home around 8pm, and first saw him in front of me on K Street between 24/25 Streets. I immediately called 911. When I got to the end of the block, he was gone. Still on the phone, I turned around to enter my building. He was coming down the alley and saw me. I texted a neighbor to meet me; she has also been stalked by him twice and filed a police report (CCN #24105710). 

As I waited for her, he paced in front of my building in an agitated way, watching me. He went back and forth several times. My neighbor arrived and the stalker guy left. 

As we waited for police, maybe a dozen other neighbors came home and most had also seen the guy in our area tonight, he is well-known to us now as an unsafe person. 

The police took 2 hours to arrive. Despite the delay, the timing was fortunate: Just as the officer arrived, the stalker guy was walking down the street again. I alerted the officer and he confronted the man, asked him if he was okay, asked him if he lived nearby. The man gave one-syllable vague answers and walked away. I gave my full report to police, CCN #24108037.

I am grateful to have supportive neighbors who share safety info. 

There was a News9 story from July 10 on this guy: [video](https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/local/dc/women-followed-home-by-same-man-foggy-bottom-dc/65-ca5716e0-244f-4caa-9291-3eb17ee5b47d).

Everybody take extra good care! If you have an encounter, call 911 immediately reference these case numbers. If you have an encounter, please file a report so there is documentation linking these incidents.

18ouj2c,I have an idea.,"Why doesn't the powers that be, crack down on everything? Why not give harsher sentences to criminals? 

Why not upgrade the doors at the metro stations to something that's harder to pass thru? And while at it station transit officers at each one and on the platforms? I get we aren't NYC but man we need more transit.

Also when it comes to the people that hate the crack down idea because it isn't solving the problem at hand about disenfranchised communities I have an idea for that aswell.

Why not have it so that unless the person applying for housing or section 8 is in a really horrible spot (and I mean really bad, like single mom of 7 or something) or just a elderly person. The people living in these places are required to either be at work or/and school daily and must meet a requirement to stay.

The kids have to be getting at least B-'s at school (kids above the age of 11)  and the adults have to be at work daily. Also money should be put into the ""rental offices"" to host Parental coaching, AA meetings, and drug addiction relief programs.

I feel like housing and section 8 should be used as a temporary thing by the people living there unless they're elderly or in a horrible situation.

Also pay those elderly people to pick up trash around their neighborhood something like $500 every two weeks.

We could install camera that run the facial recognition software and have it know residents of the homes and track who leaves and enters.

Also the abandoned homes (trap houses) can become the police security offices to help monitor the areas. 

The police training time should be extended from a few months to 2 years. I think officers should be physically and mentally fit. And they should have a regular test on both every year if they fail either they'll be on re-education/desk work for a month or 2.

Also there should be a higher outside power monitoring those officers themselves both in those neighborhoods and at the train stations.

I feel like this with some other things would greatly improve the over all feel of the city within 5-6 years. 

What do you think?",2023,12
1cdrwqm,Pipe Dream? 2bed under $3k,"I’ve been searching for apartments in DC for the past few months and have had almost 0 luck so far. Been looking for a 2 bed (or 1 bed plus den) rental in a safe (or safe as possible) location for under $3k. 

Is this even possible to find? My preference is some sort of apartment complex as Id feel safer this way, but it seems impossible to find decently affordable options that don’t have google reviews complaining about roaches, or car thefts, or vagrants roaming the hallways.

17plo0f,Inside CVS station in Columbia Heights,"This is CVS Columbia Heights in Washington,DC. This the one of many examples of the cost of Government ordered lockdowns in response to the covid, soft on crime policies as a response to Racial Hysteria Riots of 2020, and other factors as well. 

This CVS branch in DC used to be well stocked, even briefly during The Great Lockdowns, until the BLM/racial hysteria riots happened. Since then shoplifters, with intent to resell goods online for cash to buy luxury goods or drug have been raiding the store.

It is so bad that CVS at one time had pictures of the items instead of stocking then because the shoplifters evolved into highway robbers by stealing goods from truck.

Now they don't and you litterly can't buy anything anymore, unless you're getting meds.

Even the cashiers are not there and the self-checkout booths are off.

1ag2kdy,DC FEMALES PLEASE WATCH OUT FOR THIS MAN!!,"Hi! I am a fourteen year old female. Today, I was at Tenleytown McDonald’s when my friends and I noticed a strange man staring at us. We ignored it and continued to eat our food. He then came and sat at the tables behind us giving me and my friend a direct view of him. After a few minutes, we started to notice suspicious up and down arm movements and identified what he was doing. We moved to the barstool table near the digital ordering stations, but the man kept looking around the wall at us. We had some friends from school at the other end of the McDonald’s and went to go tell them what was going on. This was when we got a full view of this man staring at us and pleasuring himself. Some women got wind of this and called the cops. After about 15 minutes they still hadn’t arrived and the man was walking around aimlessly with his hands in his pants. We decided to leave and when we walked by him he sat down and unzipped his pants AGAIN. I’m not sure what happened after this as we ran out but if you see this man, STAY SAFE. I will attach an image of him below.",2024,01
17j7mvb,What can we do to make DC safer?,"It's pretty clear that we're not enforcing many laws in DC.  I expect that part of the problem we've been having is that crime has been somewhat normalized by non-enforcement, freeing people who would typically be non-criminals to be more likely to engage in breaking the law.

Who's to blame and what can we do?

My laundry list of people to blame might include:

* Muriel Bowser, Mayor
* Kevin Donahue, City Administrator
* Pamela Smith, Acting Police Chief
* Council of the District of Columbia, including Chairman Phil Mendelson and Judiciary Chair Brooke Pinto

Who am I missing?

I would normally think, ""ok, if someone's not doing their job, we can vote them out,"" but I don't think that's satisfying here.  Even if it's possible to vote out some of our officials, some elections are far away.

Can we sue the Mayor or Police Chief to get them to enforce the laws?  I see cops *watching people* break the law and they do nothing.  If you say something to the cops, they say something shitty back.  I don't know what it would actually take for them to take action.  The DC Code says ""The Mayor shall be responsible for the proper execution of all laws relating to the District.""  If the laws aren't being enforced, isn't she responsible?

What about Congress?  Could they step in and exercise some oversight of the District?

Should we protest?  Get the press on our side?  March from Anacostia or Columbia Heights to the Mayor's Office?

Should we take things into our own hands?  (That seems like a terrible idea.)

Should we post videos of cops doing nothing and try to shame them into action?

I feel like a lot of us are fed the fuck up with seeing emptied stores, headlines about carjacking, smashed storefronts, stolen packages, cars, and bicycles, friends who've been randomly punched in the face, and everything else.  There will always be *some* crime, but shit's gone too far and the criminals know they won't be made responsible for their actions.

Are we ready to do something about this?  And what can we realistically do?",2023,10

I've been living in Maryland for a significant amount of years now and honestly feel that even the supposedly ""affluent"" areas of Maryland are deteriorating in terms of crime and quality of life concerns a la D.C. proper. As someone who's a transplant to the DMV, I also find Maryland to be, depending on the region, at best mediocre and at worst god-awful, with very little in between. There's a somewhat crummy element to the state in my opinion though I could be wrong; how do you guys feel about the non-D.C. parts of the DMV?",2024,02

1691zpc,Why don’t pro-crime DC liberals care about victims?,"This is probably the most baffling aspect of pro-crime thinking to me. The US Attorney’s Office, alongside the city itself, doesn’t want to enforce laws because it “traumatizes” the black community. But then everyone else suffers from the kinds of trauma that are central to their politics. 

When stores in Anacostia close because of rampant shoplifting, the entire community suffers. It becomes harder for people south of the river to access nutritious food.

When people have guns or knives pointed in their face, they are prone to develop debilitating PTSD. Likewise for people who are just randomly assaulted by marauding gangs of teenagers

When Uber drivers have their cars stolen, they are deprived of an income source. Hell, having your car stolen is an immensely disruptive experience for *anyone*

Liberals decry “rape culture” while also making it supremely easy to get away with sexual assault in this city.

This isn't a troll post, rather a request to see if there are any that are smarter than me that are willing to see if we can put together a group to actually do something.  There needs to be something we can do to unseat these corrupt politicians who put these laws into place that literally impact our safety.

In the last two years:  I got attacked.  My friend witnessed a guy getting shot right infront of her in dupont.  I've heard \~15 shootings.  My neighbor got knocked out while walking her dog.  My friend got held up at gunpoint next to the capital building.  A bar i used to go to had a driveby and the only reason someone didnt die is because they installed bullet-proof windows.  This shit is ridiculous.  At what point do we actually stop complaining about it on the internet and do something?  The crazies are able to organize and push their agenda... maybe we should do the same.  Maybe someone out there on this subreddit has a good handle on it and we can actually mobilize (in a civil manner) to do something about it.  

Asking if anyone out there is willing to form a group to talk about an intelligent way to address this for meaningful change, rather than the circlejerk we've had of all comiserating.

1bpge3m,Email from Ted,"Dear Fans and Supporters, 

I am thrilled to share that moments ago I signed a letter of intent with D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser for a major partnership to renovate and modernize Capital One Arena, expanding Monumental's business operations into Gallery Place, transforming Downtown D.C. into a premier entertainment destination. It is one that aligns our growth mindset with a public-private partnership, which we have been seeking. 

About an hour ago, we publicly celebrated this big new partnership with the city – the Mayor, City Council, Metro Police, our neighbors, and business partners – and announced this truly new and unique opportunity for collaboration. This is the first and only letter of intent we have signed regarding a new or upgraded facility. I spoke earlier today with the Governor of Virginia, Mayor of Alexandria, and CEO of JBG SMITH, Matt Kelly, to thank them for their time and efforts on our proposal and to inform them of this newly formally signed deal with D.C. 

The assertive actions of Mayor Bowser and the D.C. Council juxtaposed against our experience in Virginia evolved our view of the best partner to support the growth of our business. In the past three months, the pivot and great work in D.C. were in stark relief from what we ultimately experienced in Virginia. While the Virginia House of Delegates did great work in evaluating our proposal, the Senate sadly did no work in even providing us a fair hearing on the true financial benefit of the project. Contrasted with the open level of collaboration that we now have in D.C., we know we are in the best position to meet the next big objectives for the benefit of our fans. 

What we have been able to negotiate in D.C. gives us tremendous opportunities. First, we are gaining 200,000 square feet of additional space as we will expand our business and hospitality operations into Gallery Place. With this expansion of space, we have the ability to program the arena and campus to drive more options for visitors and provide more services to our players and our fans. We also sought a deal that would right-size our organization with the Nationals, Orioles, and Ravens as to their venues and partnerships with the City and State. We also sought a new level of cooperation with a government entity around services such as traffic mitigation, safety and security, and cleanliness. We also sought a better and more efficient way to communicate with regulatory agencies and cut through red tape with more efficient approvals. We also sought more direct control of our practice facilities and office buildings. And more control of our future. 

We expect to create new viewing options, better and different sight lines, more comfortable seating, upgrade technical and functional infrastructure, and modernize the building as we shift from an analog to a digital world.  

This new deal achieves most of, if not all, our key objectives. And I was very impressed with the Mayor’s stick-with-it attitude — she never gave up and was always reaching out to me to keep and expand our business operations in D.C. Gratefully, we kept a good dialogue going with the City and our Mayor and have netted this opportunity for a new chapter for our organization. 

And that is in no small part because of the tremendous work undertaken by Mayor Bowser and the D.C. Council. Since the announcement that we were pursuing a partnership with Virginia in December 2023, D.C. officials have taken concrete action to support Monumental Sports and the downtown community. In January 2024, the Mayor announced the formation of the Gallery Place/Chinatown Task Force to articulate a defined vision surrounding Capital One Arena and committed $400 million for the Downtown Action Plan and a Downtown Public Realm Plan to ensure the long-term success of Downtown D.C.’s commercial core. The Mayor also opened the first Safe Commercial Corridor Hub in the Chinatown neighborhood staffed by outreach teams from multiple public safety and human services agencies that will be able to respond in real-time to challenges in the community. And earlier this month, the Council passed the Secure DC omnibus legislation with a multi-prong strategy and tactics to combat crime, including a designation around the Chinatown neighborhood as a drug-free enforcement zone. 

With this concentration of efforts downtown and particularly around our building, we are witnessing the city taking seriously the central role we can and will now play in downtown revitalization. The Mayor has articulated that we are a top priority for her administration, and we really believe it to be true. 

Sports teams provide incredible benefits to the surrounding community and drive extraordinary economic impact and a strong public private partnership is essential to sustaining both – which the Mayor recognizes. According to research conducted by the DC Business Improvement District, activity at Capital One Arena generated $54 million in DC tax revenue in 2023. Across our region, public private partnerships are the norm for professional sports teams: the MLB’s Washington Nationals secured $700 million [app.info.monumentalsports.com] in public financing to build Nationals Park and $400 million [app.info.monumentalsports.com] in public financing to build Audi Field for the MLS’s D.C. United. The Maryland Stadium Authority recently announced a $1.2 billion investment [app.info.monumentalsports.com] for Oriole Park at Camden Yards, home of the MLB’s Baltimore Orioles and M&T Bank Stadium, home of the NFL’s Baltimore Ravens, each receiving $600 million for renovations and upgrades on top of the original public funding used in the planning, financing and construction of both [app.info.monumentalsports.com]. 

So, through our own public-private partnership, we will transform Capital One Arena and engage in new space across Gallery Place to create a truly iconic epicenter – worthy of this iconic city. We will get more space, dedicated resources to create the family-friendly entertainment zone we’ve envisioned to service our millions of customers and support for our employees and athletes to make this a destination to attract and retain their talent.  

What’s most inspiring in this moment is the City’s shared vision that we achieve great success in our business. The new downtown plan which Mayor Bowser has articulated is impressive and she has made financial commitment from the city. The passage of the new crime bill led by Councilmember Brooke Pinto is very important to all citizens and businesses.  

I truly applaud the Mayor for recognizing the incredible value we bring, create and help foster and for evolving the business-friendly climate in D.C. And today we celebrate this incredible milestone for our business, for our city, for our employees, fans, and athletes!  

Our work begins now to build a state-of-the-art marquee venue for with new seating options, five-star culinary experiences that go way beyond the traditional game-day fare, and cutting-edge technology, right in the middle of the city. We're on a mission to create a masterpiece – and redefine the sports and entertainment experience, not just for the DMV, but for all sports fans.

Get ready to be part of something extraordinary!

1991 born. The DMV is totally rearranged. I left for about seven years for college and travel, and now...none of the neighborhoods I would have wanted to live in, do I now. I honestly want to leave DC, but what is better for real? Baltimore? Philly? Atlanta? Miami? I am thinking of those kinds of things.

But for this sub...where should I move?!?!? Goodness gracious. Every review is: mice, roaches, bad management, and 2.7 stars for a GORGEOUS building. I lived in Union Market in a GORGEOUS brand new industrial style apartment and it was kinda alright (in retrospect). Mostly terrible. Had to call a lot of DC departments about the mice. Woke up to a roach crawling on my face. And I was paying 1900 for a shoe box with a squeeze in bathroom.

I left and moved with my friend in Southeast (my background), and it is honestly just disconnected. Getting anywhere takes a loooong time. Like 40 minutes because I have to take a long bus ride to the metro, and right now I don't drive.

Waterfront and Navy Yard look good. Only catch...no grocery stores. Overpriced and understocked Safeway and Harris Teeter.

I lived in Silver Spring for six years. Hated it then, but loving the thought of it now. SO MANY grocery stores and in general: stores. Why DC so empty??? They really don't want people to live here. There is NOWHERE to shop for clothes. You have to go to Virginia or Maryland. There are not even boutiques like there used to be. (I'm not doing thrift stores. I finally got a job!)

Anyway, feeling pissed off cause now that I have money for one of those overpriced apartments...I can't even find one in a neighborhood that is sufficient in terms of supply. I need to be able to shop and buy things without a major trip. 

Can anyone recommend something sleek, elegant, old-style class with at least three grocery stores nearby (including ethnic) and a metro nearby for less than 2000? I will sport up to 2200 if it really gives...""there"". Above that they're not getting from me (even though I have it...).

Must be diverse. Safe. Clean. Pretty. No roaches. No mice. Can be right outside of DC, but my job is deep in Southeast close to Oxon Hill/Suitland, Maryland. So don't say Gaithersburg! XD

DC govt run-agencies and programs have been in neglect and have fudged data claiming the violent offenders were successful in the outcome of such programs. There continues to be 200-500 of the same offenders causing havoc across the city and the surrounding area because they feel impugned. Work in rehabilitating these people by DC govt-run Office of Neighborhood Safety and Engagement (ONSE) Violence Intervention (VI) received a C+ mark- indicating poor performance, however the Office of the Attorney General’s (OAG) Cure The Streets program saw a decrease in homicides in 2023 while violence soared in the rest of the District.

188od7o,Repeat Ding Dong Ditchers?,"Anyone experiencing this recently?

My partner and I currently live in a rowhouse in the Shaw. Twice this week a group of teenagers (usually 2-3 dudes) no older than 15 years old have aggressively ding dong ditched our house. I say ""aggressively"" because they are kicking in the door so hard that I can feel it from the back of the house (I thought it could've been very close range gunshots the first time it happened because you know...Shaw...). A review of our Google Home footage shows that these incidents involve the same kids.

While I know issue is small fries relative to other DC crime woes of recency, the broader concern is the interplay between the fact that subject offenders in recent months are juveniles with the fact that juvenile offenses increasingly continue to involve weapons. (See Metropolitan Police Department Biannual Report on Juvenile Arrests between January 2023-June 2023 linked here). In other words, I worry that this ding dong ditch scenario evolves into a situation where my partner or I open the door to something worse.

We know that these incidents, independently, are not causes for concern...but the steady regression of DC makes it that way.",2023,12

1ab67ns,Two middle-schoolers robbed on school grounds at knife-point.,"A message from McKinley Technology HS

DCPS Logo

January 25, 2024

Dear McKinley Middle School and McKinley Technology High School Parents and Families, 

At McKinley, we are committed to a safe learning environment. Communicating home about incidents that arise during the school day is critical to maintaining strong partnerships with families. 

Around 12:30 p.m. today, as 8th grade students were returning to the building from recess, three unknown males, one of whom produced a knife, took property from two of our students. A staff member outside witnessed the incident and immediately ushered all students, including the two impacted, safely back into our building.

Out of an abundance of caution, we went into alert status at both campuses while we contacted the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD). During alert status, instruction and movement throughout the building continue, but access to outside areas, such as sports fields, playgrounds, and courtyards, is restricted. MPD arrived at our building quickly and launched their proceedings.

Around 1:00 p.m., we received clearance to resume normal building operations, and the day continued as planned with dismissal support from DC Public Schools (DCPS) Police, MPD, DCPS security officers, and Safe Passage workers. This evening, DCPS Police and MPD will maintain a presence in our neighborhood and parking lot through all sports practices and events. All releases from afterschool practices or games will take place from the gymnasium doors, where an officer will also be stationed. This plan and increased law enforcement presence in our neighborhood will remain in place through next week. 

We will continue to support directly impacted students and those who may have witnessed this incident in coping with the effects of community violence. For our 8th graders, we held a community circle led by our two social workers, Ms. Denson and Ms. Matthews, shortly before dismissal. Our social workers connected with students, emphasized safety and security reminders, and shared their open office hours with students for next week. They are prepared to support students who need time or space to share their feelings or ask questions. 

In addition, McKinley MS and McKinley HS have robust wellness teams comprising school counselors, social workers, and psychologists. Our teams are dedicated to ensuring students have a safe and reliable space to process these recent events or emotions surrounding them. Please contact me to connect your student with support services if needed.

The safety and well-being of our students are paramount. If you have any questions, please call the school office at (202) 281-3950 or email me at kortni.stafford@k12.dc.gov.

Sincerely, 

Kortni Stafford    
Principal, McKinley Middle School, and McKinley Tech High School

I would love to live in Eastern Arlington but am basically locked out bc of budget (~$1350 rent, ~$150 utilities avg).  According to Zillow my best bets are all along Rt. 29 in the middle longitude of DC above the river or in Congress/Garfield Heights in Anacostia.  Has anybody had any horrible “I’ll never live here again” experiences or know of certain areas/neighborhoods more disposed to crime, etc. that make you stay away?  I intend to do much more extensive research and mapping in the coming months as I intend on moving between May and July.  

For reference I live in Capitol Heights MD right now and I’m not a fan tbh.  Had my 2012 Sonata vandalized in a theft attempt but I was able to get a much newer car with a steering wheel lock and haven’t had any issues since.  TBH seems like Nissans are the new thing recently at least in my area.

19c8vfa,"[X-Post with the other DC subreddit] Would this subreddit like it if there were weekly threads about the schedule, location, and help getting to or attending ANC meetings?","Look, clearly this sub is worried about crime. There is a ton of anxiety about it, a lot of clucking about it, and a whole lot of finger pointing. 

But guess what?

The ANCs in different wards meet ***all. the. time.***, some virtual, some in-person, but nonetheless they are happening and without us actually going and continuing to be civically and politically active, all of our worry is just going to feed our online anxiety.

And you know what sticking to complaining online does for us? ***Crickets...***

Now obviously attending one Advisory Neighborhood Council meeting isn't gonna make politicians listen immediately or make you feel safer overnight if you currently don't feel safe. 

But ya know what will? 

If we increase turnout and participation for a *sustained* period, prioritize collaboration between all of us so we can build offline community and game out actual ideas and solutions, and, most importantly, make it clear to our local leaders that the current trajectory is untenable for our fine city to keep going down. 

That to say, I'm more than happy to take on the mantle of making these threads and keeping them actionable and useful to the people here, but I want to know interest is all",2024,01

17nd5ln,"Monumental asking D.C. for $600M for Capital One Arena, sources say","Around the same time, Leonsis started to grow frustrated with the area around the arena. He was particularly bothered by buskers, who played loud music outside his office. In the last few years, the pandemic and remote work have hurt downtowns across the country, and Leonsis has complained about the neighborhood and the city’s lack of investment in the building.

In May, Mendelson said he met with Bowser to discuss Monumental. Mendelson said Bowser was “quite clear” she wanted to work with Leonsis even though, according to two people, the relationship between Leonsis and Bowser is strained.

In June, Mendelson met with Leonsis and Monica Dixon, Monumental’s president of external affairs and chief administrative officer. The meeting focused on “how they could stay at the arena and deal with the deferred maintenance,” Mendelson said. In the arena’s neighborhood, residents and business owners have voiced concerns about criminal activity on the busy sidewalks near Gallery Place, including suspected drug-dealing that they believe can lead to violence.

In the past, D.C. has provided 27 police officers to patrol the perimeter of Capital One during games. But in recent years, D.C. police has struggled with staffing, and the number of officers has fallen to three, according to one Monumental official. The company has made up the difference by paying off-duty officers.",2023,11

Only downside is that if you go with the second option, admission is $20 for adults but for members it is free!
