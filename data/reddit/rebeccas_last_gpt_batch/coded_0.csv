lzttvch,1h2wunn,Jaxxsnero,"This report absolutely does not support your assertion that “blacks” get away with more crime. 

What it does state is if you are a black murder victim you are 20% less likely to have law enforcement clear your murder through the arrest of criminal offenders versus years previously 

it simply doesn’t make the assertion of the race of any offender. 

it doesn’t make one claim of the race and it specifically states that the cause can’t not be attributed towards rising levels of gang- and organized-drug activity in major cities as the drop in clearance rate stating

“the general nature of police jurisdictions – urban or rural, large city or small, suburban or exurban – also fails to easily explain the racial divide in clearances. 

The decline in clearance rates for African American homicides occurred throughout most communities in the United States, regardless of size.”

What’s interesting is the timeframe and regional data of the decline. 

9 years after the civil rights act and as stated

“The rate of decline for clearance of black-victim homicides occurred most slowly in the Northeast (15.8 percentage point decline) and most rapidly in the South (20.6 percentage 
points), the Midwest (21.7 percentage points) and West (24.0 percentage points).”

It is LEGALLY required to fill one of these out for EACH firearm purchase you make in the United States, along with whatever additional forms/information your state requires. This form also serves as a comprehensive background check by the FBI NICS. Any LEGAL gun dealer with a valid FFL (Federal Firearms License) is required by law to have you fill out this form in the US, and will not hand a firearm over to you until you fill out this form and it comes back 100% clean.

>Your “so much gun legislation” limiting excessively dangerous parts like bump stocks or expanded magazine sizes haven’t done shit. 

This kind of almost proves my point. Limiting these things HAVE NOT done ""shit,"" because all it does is hurt law abiding citizens. Do you think criminals care about the Hughes Amendment in 1986 effectively banning any new ""machine guns"" from being made and made purchasable by citizens?

No, they do not because you got gang bangers running around cities across the entire United States with Glock switches that make their guns full auto with 33 round sticks.

This is just wild to me. It's not tired, it's true. Your safety falls on you, and you only. The police have no legal obligation to protect you, we hear about this time and time again. In the 1981 case Warren v. District of Columbia, the D.C. Court of Appeals held that police have a general ""public duty,"" but that ""no specific legal duty exists"" unless there is a special relationship between an officer and an individual, such as a person in custody. To expand, only 44k people die a year from guns violence. 52% of those deaths are from suicide. The remaining 21k people a year come from gang violence, famlicide, and other violent crime. Those are extremely small numbers. You wanna know what's wild? 400,000 people die EVERY YEAR from medical malpractice, but you don't see stories like that flooding the media and people taking to the streets for reform. Equal amounts of deaths every year separately for alcohol, tobacco, drugs, and obesity.

Also no such agreement.  You might be thinking of the vehicle exception to the warrant requirement under case law.  PC is still needed.

The case law that decided this was US v. Antoine Jones and was based on a D.C. case.  The takeaway from that case is that warrants are required to attach a GPS to a suspect vehicle.  There are issues that were unanswered with the case but that’s how I interpret it and I’m sure how the US Attorney/OAG would too.

I agree with you about the chaos aspect. I don't think they would get as much joy from this if there wasn't the potential danger of getting arrested or intimidating/interrupting other people.

Unfortunately, after all the articles/posts I've read about this issue, I actually do not think that people smarter than us, lawmakers or otherwise, have actually tried to do anything about this. That's what I'm particularly incensed about.

Regarding the traffic cameras, it's the only way that MPD can track down the offenders because of the no chase policy. From what I've read, around 50%+ of these off road vehicles are actually stolen, so it's the only way they can enforce the law. The act of riding illegally in DC streets is a misdemeanor and carries up to a $250 fine (but no one's ever been fined that much), and if they can't pay the $50-$150 that they're typically fined, then it comes with up to a 12 day stint in DC jail, which is again waived because it's a misdemeanor and DC Jails are way overstuffed.

So, if we had the cameras, at minimum we can hope to confiscate illegal/stolen off-roading vehicles.

Gun control will make it a bit harder for criminals to get a gun, and would bring harsher mandatory sentences upon those who use guns for violent crimes.

ie27b79,vmknzh,,"The point of movements like ""defund the police"" is not to eliminate those resources, but to redirect those funds into social programs that are shown to help reduce crime, such as  social services, youth services, housing, education, healthcare, etc.  For example, if a cop performs a welfare check instead of a social worker, there's a much greater risk of that check turning into a violent altercation.  Or if someone tries to pass a counterfeit $50 bill, a cop being called means they might be shot when the situation escalates.  As a society, we often default to police-based policies, but there are many other options that could help address people's issues without introducing a cop that often defaults to escalation and violence.  

""Defund the Police"" refers to a number of specific policy proposals that are based on the finding--that you seem to readily agree with--that merely increasing the budget of police is *not* shown to [reduce crime](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/06/07/over-past-60-years-more-spending-police-hasnt-necessarily-meant-less-crime/).

I bike to work all winter, the weather isn't terrible but your biggest issue is that you would be likely taking a route that is a) somewhat hilly for relatively flat DC, and b) going to be a complete afterthought for bikes when it comes time to plow the roads (though there is a nice wide bike lane on Tilden).",3,2015,7,2,1,"1, 6"

Everyone wants a cheap apartment in the 'nicest' parts of the city with metro access and a handhold. 

Other people offered some solid advice, like get a roommate and look at a crime map. But you won't know which areas are truly safe because you don't live here. Can't you live on campus?

I was walking down the street when some guy I've never seen before comes running up behind me saying ""sit, sir"". I stop and he comes up to me and says ""I just want you to know I completely disapprove of everything Mel Gibson said."" 

Now here's the thing, this is not really an interaction I was expecting that day. My brain just completely short circuited. Like what am I supposed to say? This guy just ran half a block to say this to me, it's clearly really important to him, and I clearly need to respond.

Some guy, probably this girls (who’s a resident in the building) boyfriend, was tripping really bad.

I’ve also done similar activities organized by hostels etc while traveling (for example, a combination bar crawl and scavenger hunt) and I’ve seen bachelorette parties do them as well, but I’m going to assume neither of these options are correct given the people who approached your friend were sober.

— Dupont/Kalorama ≈ Kensington/Notting Hill. With upscale row houses and home to most of the embassies, this is a relatively peaceful/upscale area. Tons of restaurants, bars, shops, and a weekly farmers market kinda gives DuPont a notting hill vibe.

— Adams Morgan (AdMo) ≈ Camden. AdMo is pretty hipster/offbeat for DC standards (though not at the level of Takoma Park), with its main stretch on 18th street featuring a wide mix of shops, restaurants, and nightlife. 

— U Street/Shaw ≈ Shoredtich. Lots of bars. Like AdMo, this is a top destination for young people to go out on weekends. Good place for live music as well with several of DC’s top venues (9:30 club, Lincoln Theater).

— Georgetown ≈ Knightsbridge. Very posh, known for the University and it being DC’s shopping hub. With its variety of stores, also reminiscent of SoHo.

— NoMa/H Street Cordidor ≈ Brixton. An interesting mix of grit with new developments. Street art and interesting restaurants give the area a creative energy. Also home to Union Market (the closest thing DC has to Borough/Camden). 

— Navy Yard ≈ Canary Wharf. Brand new and a little ways out, feels very different from the rest of DC. Surging in development of apartment complexes and restaurants/bars. Not known for being a business hub like Canary Wharf, though; it’s the home to the Washington Nationals (city’s baseball team)",56,2021,11,2,1,"1,7"
hkvn0ha,qv8awv,leffbehind,"Hi OP! As someone who moved from London to DC after grad school I hope I can give you a good perspective of everything here in DC. 

1. DC is *significantly smaller* than London. Anyone who has been to NYC/LA/SF will also tell you this, but from one seat of government to another, you will quickly realize that DC is a tiny fraction of the size of London. However, what's nice is that DC (in some areas) actually seems quite dense and slightly similar to European cities.
2. Public Transit will be good - in the context of transit in the US. European cities have decades of developed infrastructure for folks who don't have cars and the US is very much the opposite. DC however is one of the most walkable cities in the US and there are a host of different public transit options, as long as you are not to snobby to ride the bus (Moving from London where I bussed or tube everywhere I never understood some DC residents' need to turn their nose up at the busses.)
3. For your budget you will have plenty of options and, I would also aim for the West End (not much there, and a bit too close to college students at GW)/Dupont/Kalorama/Adam's Morgan/west of Logan Circle axis. These areas are *relatively* low crime, quiet, walkable, have plenty of shoppes and eateries, and you can meet new people. **However, noise level varies extremely based on the individual unit and the street(s) that it faces.** This is not satisfying, unless you have a buddy here already, but if you can - **tour the unit and linger as long as you can** ***in the unit*** **to accurately gauge the noise level of the individual unit.** I currently live in a building with a gorgeous unit that faces one of the loudest street corners in DC and will be moving next month out of Columbia Heights because of it - yet folks who live on the other side of the building have quiet and serene living spaces.
4. What may appear odd to you and will seem normal to most Americans is how DC, an urban city, has a *completely random arrangement of completely residential blocks* interspersed throughout the city (things like Swann St. NW). These are very cute and if you can manage to find a ground floor (not basement) unit in one of these in your price range, that is the golden ticket.
5. The weather is similar, but on the whole, better than London. The amount of days where it just lightly rains all day long (my most hated part of London) is relatively small. Summers in DC will be more humid and a bit hotter, and I'd actually say the winters are comparable. In general about 15-30% less rain and it's usually harder and quicker in duration.
6. Lots of churches, like, a lot, even considering that London has been inhabited since Roman times, DC has probably 20x the churches of London
7. Dogs Dogs Dogs - DC has very quickly become a city of dog-owners. This is I think a relatively recent advent in DC greatly accelerated by COVID, but there will be many many more dogs here, which I as a pet owner, love.
8. DC residents think they have a lot of rats/mice - they have never lived in London :D.
9. Do not believe anyone who says an ""Irish Bar/pub"" is good in DC, I am yet to find one.
10. U St. is generally too loud and busy, but there are quiet bubbles to be found. 
11. NoMa is still being gentrified/redeveloped in a piecemeal fashion so certain parts of it are very modern (and people love it) and other parts are very urban blight/empty lots/crime - and *it is far from the various other centers of DC young/exciting/interesting life except for the H St. corridor/Eastern Market.* 
12. Now I'll also give you an additional random list of trade offs:
   1. Higher Priced items in DC: 
      1. Theatre/Events tickets - Yes there are opportunities to get free/cheap tickets with good seats, but I went to a massive amount of plays, ballets, musicals, concerts, etc. in London for a nice chunk cheaper than here in DC. 
      2. Gym memberships - These are treated like a luxury good in DC and while there are some that have various tiers of pricing, you will likely get a bit of sticker shock - When I lived in London a new gym opened within 1-3 tube stops every 4-5 months, making pricing competitive. Gyms in DC are run/owned by about 4-6 companies who have no incentive to have competitive pricing (Avoid WSC if you can) -
      3. Healthcare - I will not bore you with the details, but it's a lot more expensive and it's something **you will need to budget for** unless you work at a tech company that pays all your premiums (this is rare, but happens)
   2. Cheaper items in DC
      1. Museums - London is good, but I'd argue that DC's got it beat on the massive volume of free museums/art galleries and the like
      2. **Housing - what you can afford for 2500 in DC will be palatial, modern, clean and in a great neighborhood compared to London flats.**
      3. Groceries - The difference here is not large, but it is enough that you will notice your spend at Harris Teeter/Safeway/Giant is probably slightly cheaper than your standard London Tesco. This scales so M&S prices>Trader Joes, Waitrose prices>Whole Foods
      4. **Utilities - these bills are A LOT cheaper in the US**

Also, yes some of the buildings might appear “old”, but it’s perfectly fine because most of the apartments are clean and refurbished inside with all the modern equipments. It’s not completely modern but that a trade off to live in the best area. Search for a preferably“rent control” building with a good rental management company.

hkvdv7e,qv8awv,emcee_gee,"I'm the same age as you are. I moved here in August and had the same budget. I do have a car, but I only use it on road trips; not for commuting or other regular activities. I bike and walk a lot and take the Metro when I go in to work. I had visited DC a handful of times over the last decade or so, so I already had a decent idea of the neighborhood vibes.

I chose the U Street area. Not _on_ U Street -- that would be too crazy/loud for me at this point in my life. But close enough that I still get the benefit of all the businesses and nightlife when I want to go out. I chose a condo building that wasn't _super_ new and didn't have all the flashy amenities, but had a relatively strong community of grown adults.

I'd recommend finding a Realtor to help you find a place. They don't generally work with the big property management firms; instead, they help you find individual condos listed by smaller landlords usually with only one or two units (often, places they themselves used to live). I've always been happier renting from individuals than companies; plus, with a Realtor, you get the benefit of having someone who takes the time to get to know you and what you're looking for, rather than having a bunch of 15-minute tours with different listing agents where you've got to ask all the same questions every time and you never really know how honest they're being. Realtors work on commission, generally taking the first month's rent from the landlord, so it doesn't cost you anything.

I work 3 blocks over (Farragut Square area). It's not feasible by walking, but I recommend Alexandria Old Town if bicycling is an option. Has metro access direct to DC, is very, very safe, cute cafes, gorgeous Old Town that reminds me a lot of the U.K. (it was a British colonial city after all), vibrant King Street with lots of restaurants and rowhomes. It's an urban city and feels like an extension of Washington, D.C., but still has that ""Hot Fuzz"" charm. It's the crown jewel of the metro area imo (though I moved out since it was getting DC-levels of expensive).

Honestly, Mount Vernon Triangle, U Street, and Noma are all recently-converted-transitional neighborhoods, so the ""urban frontier"" won't be too far away at any given point. So they may feel sketchy if you turn the wrong corner. Logan Circle is the gay district of D.C. It's a small cute district, but very expensive. Not sure if you swing that way, but if so, it's a great place to be (Dupont Circle is the former LGBT district, but now is for older gays + diplomats - since it abuts Embassy Row).

I avoid Uber like the plague unless a dire situation (and because two drivers pulled up, my teen daughter put her hand on the door handle - I was behind her - and the driver sped off and cancelled the ride. Couldn't even complain.)

I figured out - and might be dissimilar to your situation - that Lyft has this ""priority service"" that is an outright scam. 

* For example, ""Pick up in 5 minutes, $17. Pick up in 10, $14. Pick up in 20, $10."" Except that if I pick 5 minutes, it can still take 15 and they charge me $20. If I pick 10 minutes, it can come in 5 minutes for $15...or in 20 minutes and they charge $15. Or I pick $20 and it comes in 5 minutes and I'm charged $17. There is absolutely no rhyme or reason. To me, this seems like it is against contract law. Can a store say, ""1 pound of tomatos for $5"" then you get to the cash register and it's $10?? No, that's illegal. Advertised price is advertised price. 
* The ride cancelling is RIFE. Sometimes I have had my ride cancelled 2-3 times before a driver actually comes. And I still pay more than advertised!  A couple years ago I missed two planes because of this. I left 2.5 hours before my flight at DCA and twice didn't make it because of the cancelled rides! Zero possibility to complain as there is no ride or driver to link the complaint to.

Another reason I am straight up Empower, Curb or regular taxi now. Empower might take a bit longer, but the drivers keep all fares except like $100 subscription fee a month.

The other thing is that a couple times I treated myself to a ""Luxury"" Lyft driver and they were all the worst, rudest drivers I ever had on Lyft. Who cares what they car was. One was so comical, I felt like I had been kidnapped my Russian mafia. And not like in a funny way.",25,2023,5,2,1,"1, 3"

Taking someone home along Good Hope or Naylor Road is fine, but then shutting the app off to drive empty straight back across the bridge to Navy Yard/Capitol Hill costs money and wastes time.

Cutting off traffic flow from the Key Bridge would be tantamount to condemning Georgetown.

I grew up in a big city in the 90s and remember when homicides were a lot higher than now. It’s not something we should aspire to. And there are clear national trends around policing and enforcement of laws that dictate whether crime rates and murder rates go up and down.

And, no, it’s not dense to study the long term trends around homicides. The graph from 1900 onward is at least worth considering when we try to understand what’s normal or not around homicides. It’s useful to compare to other industrialized countries as well.

The city has no historic industrial base that created class and cultural consciousness that are engines of culture seen in other great American cities. There's a profound emptiness in DC. I have fun here, don't get me wrong. But there's no gravity here. Also, I find it odd that using blinkers is illegal. I mean, it must be illegal: I've never seen anyone use one.

>The Connecticut Avenue Multimodal Safety Improvement Project (originally named Connecticut Avenue NW Reversible Lane Safety and Operations Study) was initiated in December 2019. Data analysis, concept development and evaluation, traffic forecasts, and operations analysis were conducted between Spring 2020 and Fall 2020. Between March 2020 and January 2023 approximately 70 stakeholder and agency presentations/events have taken place.

>**During 2021, four Advisory Neighborhood Commissions- ANC 3C, 3E, 3F and 3/4G -and numerous organizations provided resolutions to DDOT requesting that “Concept C” be advanced. On December 15, 2021, Mayor Bowser and DDOT requested the project staff to move forward with Concept C. Concept C includes the removal of the reversible lanes and the addition of one-way protected bicycle lanes on the east and west sides of Connecticut Avenue.** The project also adds other safety improvements, including the addition of left and right turn lanes at intersections, pedestrian refuge islands and curb extensions, intersection realignments, prohibition of Right Turn on Reds, reducing the posted speed limit from 30 mph to 25 mph, and other features.

>On March 19, 2020, the official start of the Covid-19 pandemic, the District Department of Transportation deactivated the operation of the Connecticut Avenue NW peak hour reversible lanes. A decision was subsequently made to permanently remove the peak hour reversible lanes. Removal of the reversible lanes’ signs and markings were completed in the summer 2022. In addition, one of the Concept C recommendations was to reduce the Connecticut Avenue speed limit from 30 mph to 25 mph. This action was also completed in summer 2022.

>**In early 2023, the DDOT leadership has requested that project staff take a fresh look at all of the concepts that were considered, including a reassessment of Concept C. DDOT has received a considerable number of comments during this past year related to the parking removals required to implement Concept C. This reassessment currently is occurring as of August 2023.**

>DDOT has recently reformulated our Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) for the project. This reformulation of the CAC has occurred because the boundaries of the Advisory Neighborhood Commissions and Single-member Districts have changed based on redistricting and the results of the latest decennial census. We expect that the first meeting of this reformulated CAC will occur in fall 2023.

lzlzwyq,1h2s4bl,rachelella04,"Hey, I lived in rosslyn three years. To preface, I love DC and would live there over Rosslyn if the price and logistics were right for me. Noma might be a better fit for you, but I’ll share my experience in rosslyn at least: 

I loved taking the metro 10 mins or less to Soundcheck for EDM shows, to Metro Center and a short walk to Capitol One arena for bigger concerts or sporting events, or to Warner Theatre and DC improv for comedy shows. Also very convenient for events at the Kennedy Center. Look up the other music venues in DC like The Anthem (at the wharf), 930 club, Atlantis, songbyrd, echostage, flash, capitol one arena, Lincoln theatre, union stage, merriweather post pavilion, etc. Will help you see what the commute would be like to each (the Moovit app is good for public transit estimations).  Songbyrd would be right in your neighborhood in Noma, and Noma has an outdoor free concert series in the summer. Need to take a couple legs to get to several of the venues from rosslyn (eg need to transfer on metro from O/B/S to green line north to get to U st venues of 930 and Atlantis, or to green line south to get to wharf venues of Anthem and Union stage). But honestly when shows get out after 1 AM you’re likely going to have to uber/lyft home to noma or to rosslyn either way for most of these venues since our metro system doesn’t run too late here. I find Ubers/lyfts home to rosslyn decently affordable since by mileage it’s not far from DC proper. If there’s surge pricing, I just e-bike home instead — it’s honestly my fave mode of getting around DC since we have such robust bike lanes.

There’s a small social scene in Rosslyn if you’re looking to grab a beer right after work - there’s a neighborhood bar called Quinn’s that’s always busy.  Open road is also always busy during HH as is continental beer garden in warm months. Salt cocktail bar for something fancier. But as a whole like others have said, don’t expect any nightlife here or extensive restaurant and bar options. You can walk to  Clarendon for more restaurant and bar options, but lots of basic early 20 years old there, I always personally prefer the venture into DC proper for the actual DC cultural experience. So yes, you’ll have more options in noma. 

Re social clubs and sports, will prob have better access in Noma. I have friends on intramural teams that are based in noma, and my bf’s soccer teams are often in the district in navy yard or Shaw. 

Also re social life, I commented on someone else’s post that almost all my friends are in DC because I made an effort to spend time in DC, not Arlington. I have a single friend in Arlington and countless friends in DC. Its certainly helpful when my DC friends live or enjoy hanging out in neighborhoods most convenient for me to get to from rosslyn, such as DuPont circle, Georgetown, west end, foggy bottom, Chinatown, Logan circle. When I’ve had friends up in Columbia heights, petworth, Adams Morgan, or Mount Pleasant it’s more of a PITA by public transit to get to them. Some friends are more willing than others to pick a meeting spot that’s a good middle ground for both parties. And as the other poster said, some people are a bit immature about crossing over the river despite rosslyn being one metro stop (three mins) from the district. Now if they don’t want to take multiple legs of transit to get to someone that’s one thing, but if they live in Capitol Hill and would be open to taking O/B/S lines to foggy bottom, but not rosslyn, that’s just asinine imo. I had a rooftop pool I invited my friends to in the summer, and one of them literally gave me that as her rationale for passing - just tell me you don’t wanna come… But yeah, if you’re trying to date, I could potentially see it being an automatic swipe left when ppl see you’re in Arlington because of those mindsets, so to keep your options open, noma could be better in that sense (although I personally wouldn’t want to date someone so closed-minded lol)

Not sure how much crime matters to you, but noma’s is worse than rosslyn’s for sure. Nothing particularly wrong with that if you have a good head on your shoulders and have tolerance for some grunginess and sketchiness - chance of being assaulted is higher but many prefer neighborhoods with character and more crime over a bland area like rosslyn. The vibes in the two neighborhoods couldn’t be more different - night and day.
 
For me, I fly a lot - so I love that rosslyn gets me metro access to both DCA and IAD easily without transfers.  I value commute to work, airport access, safety, and love walking home from the metro late at night alone. So I accept that rosslyn itself doesn’t have a vibrant social life for me, and that there is an additional hassle of having to take the metro or bike to have access to DC vibes that I love, rather than being able to walk to them (cannot afford to live in DC / I don’t like the neighborhoods that I can afford).

As for the bus, I think buses are great! I've never had any major issues and any time someone has gotten out of hand (such as shouting or swearing a lot) the bus driver told the person to knock it off or they would kick them off. 

Or consider getting a bike or Capital Bikeshare membership - I use bikeshare to get from the metro to work (about 1 mile) and it is great!

Three thoughts:

1. Do not get into a set routine - leaving and/or coming home at the same time every day and taking the same exact route every day is a mistake anywhere. I feel very safe where I live (and my fiance is a 6' tall big guy with a beard) but I still make a point to vary my routine one day every week or two - leave 15 minutes earlier, come home slightly later, stop at the grocery store randomly, etc.

2. Consider carrying pepper spray or some other similar option. I used to in college, don't feel the need to anymore. I never needed it but it made me feel safer at the time. It also gave me more confidence and a better ""don't fuck with me"" attitude. Which leads me to ... 

3. If you walk around like you know where you are going and do not want anyone to mess with you most people will leave you alone. If you are staring at your phone (or otherwise distracted), looking around like you are lost, or are just generally unsure then it draws more attention.

First, if you have money to spare, help someone in need out. If not, you always have grace to spare. Take ten seconds to look a fellow human being in the eye, tell them you can’t help them right now, and wish them well.  

Second, if you have the time and skill to help someone who is clearly in trouble, do so. If the woman looked shaken up from being called a bitch, it’s ok to ask if she’s ok.

Third, have some empathy for people who are clearly having a tough day/week/month/year. You don’t have to excuse someone’s behavior in order to understand it.

WHOA. Maybe they avoided 30 minute lines with double pours on every drink. We had a blast, food was great, I don’t remember the Uber home and I woke up at 2PM in pain, but happy about the night. 

Also went to Gaylord party (haw haw) for 2012 and while it was adequate, I can see what you’re saying. It def had a cash grab feel.

Maybe the answer is go a little smaller, a little more personal.

I’m sure there are countless other similar parties around the area. Local comics, local bands, bars and restaurants looking to entice people out, whatever. You don’t have to pay $100+ for a mediocre evening.

You initiate the chargeback, and they'll ask for a general reason why (""services paid for but not provided"" is a common one, it varies by bank). They'll ask you for a paragraph about what happened, and let you upload any material supporting your claim.

They'll temporarily credit you back the amount and take the money out of the business's account while a fraud investigator investigates. The investigator may or may not reach out to you. The offending party/business has 60 (or 90, I don't remember) days to dispute the chargeback and provide evidence that you should have to pay (e.g., services were rendered). If they don't respond, or you're clearly in the right, the credit will stay on your account (aka refund) and the business doesn't get it back.

It is truly an inevitability. Like, 100 years from now, do they think conn Ave is gonna look exactly like it does now? Even while population growth, change in modals, changes in electrification, all that, it’s gonna happen anyway.

k6vkx96,17iju7a,roraima_is_very_tall,">Fuck those NIMBYs that live on Wisconsin. 

> like to remind them that, being boomers,

I support bike lanes and prefer protected bike lanes, but I also like my facts served hot and accurate: So what do wisconsin avenue property owners have to do with this, and can you site some statistics somewhere showing that the people involved in protesting the lanes were born around 1946 -1964? this sounds like an ageist rant from an uninformed person. It's connecticut avenue, and I doubt you have any facts to back up the age group involved who are supportive of this mindless flier, or even know what the ""boomer"" age-group actually is. I'm gen-x for example, and most of reddit likes to mash older millennials + gen x into boomers even though I'm no where near a 1946 baby.
