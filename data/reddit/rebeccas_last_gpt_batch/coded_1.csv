But in the 80's - 90's you saw the shift because of smaller police forces and the idea that technology (radios, surveillance, ect) and the expansion of investigation offices (narcotics, gangs, firearms) police forces felt that these specialized investigation units could do better crime prevention and enforcement. Also, a reason for the move away from this was the rampant corruption of those foot patrol officers who either was paid off to elected to turn a blind eye to a lot of the organized crime in their areas.  

Interestingly enough, our operations in Iraq up to 2007-2008 surge was very much like our police, we'd drive around in our humvees looking for or in many cases waiting for insurgents to engage us while conducting soft/hard knock searches at night. During the surge we conducted more foot patrols, integrated into our local areas in small COPs with local Iraqi police or Iraqi army units and created a much bigger and sustained presence versus daily patrols from our FOB. This marked at first large incidents of fighting because we were not embedded in our AOs but dropped shortly as we denied the insurgents freedom of movement and ability to operate within the local population.

kjewb6w,19el7l2,thebarkingdog,"MPD here.

First answer: We don't have the officers. 

We're so short most Districts are holding over officers from the previous shift nearly every day to make minimum staffing. We weren't defunded, but the freeze in hiring by the council in 2020 will be felt for another decade. And we HAVE to staff the patrol cars first, and we can barely do that. 

Ex. 5 years ago, Adams Morgan and U Street had two units, 40 officers, 20 for each location in addition to regular patrol. That unit is now down to 15 officers for both locations.

Second Answer: Resource allocation. 

Contee made the news when he consolidated and made the all bike patrol unit a few years ago. Except it wasn't made up of new officers but instead, officers he pulled from the Districts. So those Districts lost their officers to other parts of the city.

Third: Practicality. 

Putting someone on a foot beat for 40 hours a week, wears on them. Now factor in weather, call volume, duties, training, etc. And you can see where it can go wrong.

It’s not just about quality of policing with residency requirements, it’s about 1) maintaining a tax base and 2) having a police force composed of the people who actually live in the community. 

As your USA Today piece points out, white police officers tend to live in the cities where they worked when those cities were majority-white and white officers were also more likely to reside outside the city than their Black or Latino counterparts.

The piece also includes the argument that residency requirements should be more specific in order to be effective and require officers to live in the neighborhoods where they work. 

I don’t know if any program has included that much specificity or been enforced with any kind of effort beyond a cursory check of a provided address.

Someone was just robbed at gunpoint on the front stoop of my apartment building LAST NIGHT. A terrifying experience, no doubt. However, I give you my cost benefit analysis of why it's still worth it to live in the hood.

Let's say you get mugged, and give them what they want, immediately (which, for the record, you should ALWAYS DO, without question). You'll end up losing your cash, nothing on credit if you call your company soon enough, and probably the fees to get a new license/ID, maybe your Smartrip, etc. Maybe you also lose your nice purse or wallet, but we'll say all of that is worth around $250. The biggest ""cost"" you'll face is the fear of being mugged. Say that is $1000 worth of fear to you (weird concept, but humor me here - this is how cost benefit analysis works). If you move to Near NE, KNOWING that you will get mugged, it becomes something that you're prepared for, and slightly less scared of. The cost of doing business, so to speak. You know it's going to happen, you're not going to get hurt if you hurry up and give the money and don't argue, and you have come to terms with that. And then it becomes a little less scary, and maybe you're only facing $500 of fear. That is now only $750 you're going to lose by being mugged. If it happens once a year (WAY more often than real life), that is a lot less than you're saving on rent by living in the hood. Of course, realizing all this and internalizing it makes the idea even less scary (although guns are still REALLY scary in person) so it's an even better deal.

I've lived around H st for 2 years and never had a problem. I've seen problems, and heard of them, and had them happen to my friends, but it hasn't happened to me yet. I'm prepared for it though, by assuming it WILL eventually happen. If the area gentrifies even more (which it appears to be doing), bonus! In fact, chances are you may never be mugged. But if you do get mugged, you ""knew"" it going in, so it will be manageable.",1,2010,11,2,1,"1, 5"

WASHINGTON (NNS) -- An active shooter was reported inside the Naval Sea Systems Command Headquarters building (Bldg. 197) on the Washington Navy Yard at 8:20 a.m. (Eastern Time).

There is one confirmed injury. Emergency personnel are on scene and a ""shelter in place"" order has been issued for Navy Yard personnel.

The Naval Sea Systems Command's headquartes is the work place for about 3,000 people.

The organization is comprised of command staff, headquarters directorates, affiliated Program Executive Offices (PEOs) and numerous field activities. Together, we engineer, build, buy and maintain ships, submarines and combat systems that meet the Fleet's current and future operational requirements.

Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) is the largest of the Navy's five system commands. With a fiscal year budget of nearly $30 billion, NAVSEA accounts for one quarter of the Navy's entire budget. With a force of 60,000 civilian, military and contract support personnel, NAVSEA engineers, builds, buys and maintains the Navy's ships and submarines and their combat systems.",11,2013,9,2,1,"1,3"

cc9g072,1mhwjr,maker86,"I'm going to assume he has a few issues here.  First, the guy probably isn't using an assault rifle as most people define it.  The distinction has to do with whether the rifle can fire more than one bullet with a pull of the trigger.  It's unlikely that an automatic weapon would be used in a crime as they're fairly expensive and hard to come by.  If this is just a standard AR-15 type weapon, and that's what it sounds like, it would be more appropriately defined as an assault weapon (as opposed to assault rifle), though that term is often also met with hostility as it classes a weapon based more on appearance than functionality.

The other possible issue is that if this were instead an automatic rifle, say an M4 or M16, that fact wouldn't really matter much.  Automatic fire is seldom useful for anything but suppression, which means keeping the enemy under cover while friendlies reposition or evacuate.  It's true that automatic gun fire can kill many people quickly if they're all grouped together and not expecting it, but this situation has evolved past that now.

More useful information would be a whether its a standard rifle or a carbine, the caliber of the rifle, what kind of optics he has, does it look like he's carrying a lot of extra magazines, does he have any sidearms or specialty weapons like a shotgun for breeching, any kind of grenades, what other gear is he wearing, and does he have any kind of communication equipment.  I'm not saying that knowing if the rifle is capable of full auto is not useful information, but it is not as useful as the other information I've noted.  Additionally, the media has proven themselves unreliable in determining weapon types, so there's absolutely no reason to take them seriously in this regard.",5,2013,9,2,1,0
cc9fyiq,1mhwjr,,"The ""assault"" designator can be useful assuming we know enough about the rifle. It has a specific definition relating to the caliber and action type.

In the case of, say, an M-16 vs. AR-15, the M-16 is an assault rifle whereas the AR-15 is a ""modern sporting rifle"" or simply ""[semi-]automatic rifle"".",2,2013,9,2,1,0

Until the last 5 years, many of their neighbors were 9-5 public sector employees or worked at NGOs or other non-profits. Most but not all were college educated with bachelors degrees but were not lobbyists or “Big Law” lawyers or anything. The woman who lived next door worked at the DC public library and her husband was an HVAC technician before he retired. 

Recently, many longtime residents have retired and sold their houses to the folks many other commenters will assume already owned these houses. Some have been forced to sell because they couldn’t afford the real estate taxes on their dramatically appreciated houses.

While the new buyers today quite wealthy in many west-of-park neighborhoods, this was not always the case. The city was very different back when my parents bought their place in a whole host of ways. The dramatic appreciation in real estate values since the mid-90s, and the post-08 change in the mortgage process, has completely changed the profile of people who can buy here. 

Those younger buyers replacing my childhood neighbors are of course in the stereotypical industries. Those are the only people who can afford to buy those houses at market these days. Many of these folks are transient DC residents and not native Washingtonians who bought way before the housing market became what it is today. There’s no issue with new people moving here, it’s just that those folks are the only ones who can buy at market.

Also, saving a lot doesn't equate to having a high investment portfolio.  Having $20k in the bank, is different than owning a $100,000 home with a $20k down payment.

This is also ignoring the fact that you are stuck paying a mortgage even if you don't live there, so there is the unrealized cost that comes from lack of quick mobility.

You don't really own your home until you have paid off your mortgage. You are just paying a rent to your mortgage company/local govt. instead of your landlord.

hhj6cws,qcrzz5,The_Bard,"What you said makes no sense even on a surface level. You still pay for real estate tax and mortgage costs when you rent. It's just not itemized. Your  landlord isn't paying for those things out of the goodness of their hearts. It's baked into the cost of your rent. Sure you lose out on closing costs. But still, tell me in what world someone is able to pay for housing and save the  equivalent value of the equity they gain on their home each month.

Yes there are upfront and backend costs to sale. Yes there is tax and insurance and interest costs. But all these exist in commercial real estate as well and are passed on to the renter. 

Also to describe a mortgage as not owning the house until the end of the mortgage is totally inaccurate. If that were the case you wouldn't see a dime selling the house before the mortgage was up. You own the value of the house minus the amount owed to the mortgage lender. 

The premise of your point is still faulty. There is no where I've lived where renting an equivalent property cost less than a mortgage including property tax, interest and insurance.

The problem is not that you still pay for housing when you purchase your home because those costs are explicitly laid out when you buy the house. The problem is indeed that if you invest your down-payment and don't buy a house, you still have to pay the equivalent of a mortgage and all related costs to house yourself. There isn't magic extra money to invest.

You act like you've got all these gotchas that no one has considered, but literally everyone understands the costs. And literally every one is passed on to the renter. You can tell by the cost of rent being higher or equivalent to a mortgage and all associated costs.",2,2021,10,2,1,0

I full ass wouldn’t do this, but also I’m a woman and have seen a *lot* of this style post and it’s usually a scam or some dude being like “FREE RENT! looking for a female roommate 18-25 willing to share a studio. Must be in shape, clean the apartment, cook me three meals, and share my bed” style bullshit. 

If we are going to look past that, here are a few thoughts:

Have you ever shared a studio before? I know you said you’re fine with it, but until you’ve done it you might not be thinking about some of the practical challenges it entails. I shared a studio with my now husband when I first moved here and we were waiting for his lease to run out. Sharing a space with no walls can be awkward even if you are in a relationship with the person. I can’t imagine sharing one with someone I didn’t know.

Think about things like sleep habits, different levels of cleanliness, etc. When you have a roommate but each have your own bedroom it creates the idea of private vs. shared space. The general consensus among every roommate I’ve ever had is that your bedroom can be as messy as you want but the common space is to be kept clean as a courtesy to your roommates. A studio, even a large one, could create an environment where one of you wants to be awake when the other wants to be asleep, or where one person keeps things very tidy and the other person lets their “bedroom” area king of take over.

This isn’t to say dude is a bad guy—although of course you are correct to be wary of assault, sexual violence, theft, etc when moving in with anyone—but someone’s annoying habits become a lot more annoying when you can’t get away from them. Additionally, it will likely always feel like his space and not your home. What happens if one of you meets and brings them home or someone wants to entertain? 

If you do go for it, I’d definitely take the small dressing room area and put a single bed in there, lock the door and be done with it. That said, it could produce its own challenges, if you’re in the dressing room that means he now needs to get dressed and ready entirely in the bathroom, or else he’s just naked in the common space, which is awkward.

Did you get a chance to talk to him about his lifestyle at all? What hours he’s home, what time he needs to get ready for work, when/if he entertains at home, and the like?",3,2023,10,2,1,0

It was quite obviously an illegal sublet situation, and I knew that going in, but I was young and stupid and just figured it would work out. 

One day he said he was moving back to the states and that my roommate and I had, 15 days to vacate. And he could do that because there was no protection for us since we were subletting illegally. I ended up finding an apartment but couldn’t move in until the end of the month which meant moving all my shit to a storage unit and couch surfing for a few weeks then moving into the new place, which was very annoying.

If you don’t have a lot of stuff (e.g. you won’t have to get a storage unit) and the dude didn’t seem creepy it could work, but it is RISKY in terms of personal safety and housing security.

Some people have made the argument that it helps people who are triggered by the word raped to see graped instead, but people who actually have that sensitivity have told me it sucks because any browser extension they’ve set up to filter ‘raped’ doesn’t work on alternate words.

Request an officer to come to your house , and report a threats to do bodily harm (hate crime based on race, and color) provide the offender description to the officer.

The way second sighting  works, if you ever come across the offender again. You call 911 provide the call taker the CCN FOR THE THREATS TO DO BODILY HARM, and advise its a second sightin. Provide the  clothing description and the  location of the offender(EX. OUTSIDE LIQUOR STORE, OR STANDING WITH A GROUP OF PEOPLE  NEXT TO A WHITE FORD). 

Officers will respond and arrest him on scene without you having provide details about the crime, since the information will be in the intial report by the  officer who responded to you.

If the officer ask you why you didn't call at the time, advise them that you did call 911, and  you felt the need to report  it since there is a possibility you see him again. Also report that you belief he's capable of committing the threat.",25,2022,1,2,1,"1, 4"

The prosecutor (Asst AG for race-based incidents!) explained that because of the enhancement, the assailant will be psychologically evaluated and can receive affordable, timely anger management / mental health counseling. She also said that they will be detained until the detention hearing as a public safety concern if you are worried about your assailant threatening people in the area. If there is no outstanding criminal record, you can even ask for diversion, which means the charge will not go on their permanent record and they will instead do stuff like community service.

The only way your 911 call didn't even go through is if your phone itself didn't have a connection to the towers or some kind of software bug on your phone.

I'd recommend you reach out to your cell phone service provider and file a complaint. They should take ""not able to call 911 in the middle of a city"" fairly seriously, 1 because it makes them liable if something would have happened and 2 they weren't in compliance with the FCC regulations surrounding your phone having to be able to contact the emergency line.

jwd4fon,15repdb,PreposterisG,"I am going to assume what people really worry about is the chance themselves (or friends or other closely related people) are victimized. A vast majority of DC crime is poor young black men on other poor people. So if you are not a poor person that knows poor young black men, I don't think the risk is as clear as it seems. I don't think there is good data on crime perpetrated by strangers against non-poor people (which I assume the average user of this subreddit to be). 

I am not trying to minimize and say any life is worth more than another. The murder rate is morally abhorrent. But I think what people are really worried about is the risk to themselves, and these overall murder rates are likely not a good indicator of that for a lot of people.  

For me the easy risk comparison is driving on a highway. My gut says that the risk you trade off of not getting randomly murdered in DC is probably around the risk you take on of dying in a car accident if you move to the burbs.

Edit: one more thing. I would check out the rate of population growth between 2012 and 2023 for all of these cities. Since your scaling by 2012 population, the analysis will show lower murder rates in cities that grew faster.

This was at 3pm on a Sunday afternoon, literally in front of people pushing strollers. A week later, my wife was chased down the street by a man who physically tried to grab her. Same neighborhood; same 7 figure homes. Reiterating that I understand statistical probability, and that I'm unlikely to ever experience that again, the random nature of what happened to me is impossible to defend against. And while I agree that this subreddit is crime-obsessed, I think you do a disservice to your neighbors to brush off crime so flippantly.

Yep, this is an anecdote. But the data show that violent crime is both increasing and is less geographically isolated in DC in recent years.

And since resources are short, they can only properly prosecute a fraction of the potential case load. And so certain crimes have to be overlooked so they can ensure cries like murders etc get prosecuted. At least this is my understanding. Which is a crazy shitty calculus to have to make as a prosecutor. Not saying I like this prosecutor. I just am skeptical that a new one could magically do a lot better with the same tool-set.

Again, you're incoherent, but if you're trying to say that the drop in DC's prosecution rates was in line with national trends, then you're once again completely wrong. USAO's prosecution rates are abysmal in a comparative sense. [NYC on average declines to prosecute 11% of felonies and 17% of misdemeanors.

Search for DC Crime Cards and look at the map (for some reason the map doesn't work on Chrome, so you'll have to use Edge or Safari). Filter the map to show all violent crime with or without a gun in the last 2 years. It'll give you insight on the neighborhoods that are safest.

Generally speaking from hanging out there, and this could just be a pre versus post covid thing, you know where not to go in Chicago. Around here, I can be coming out of Comet and someone can hop out of a car and just start beating the shit out of someone at the bus stop. Tanner park had a damn drive by. I was in a liquor store- a pretty nice one in northwest- and 3 girls came in and ran away with a whole end cap. Walked into lost gen one time and a dude had been mugged on a run at 3:30 pm (that was the guy who mugged 18 or so people in a stretch of a week). That’s not happening on the lake trail in broad daylight out there, IIRC. There were a series of assaults and a murder at Catholic, I don’t think that’s happening at DePaul (though maybe it is, I dunno). Kids throwing rocks at people on a trail is just normalized here. Maybe it doesn’t percolate up into the news in other cities, but one city I lived in which people think of as much worse than DC one bad kid trying to fight a lady on a trail was in the news for a week, and here it’s just Tuesday. 

I haven’t lived anywhere where a universal piece of advice is “avoid transit when school gets out.”

These are all parts of town where, you know, generally they’re pretty nice- some were not nice not too long ago- but you will either witness some shit, or get there shortly after some shit has happened, and that’s just not very common in other cities in the US and we shouldn’t pretend it is. 

Maybe it’s just post COVID there’s a mean shift down everywhere, and bullshit is more likely to pop off everywhere, I dunno, I suspect that’s true. But people in DC normalize insane things as “city living” and as someone who has lived in medium to large US cities their entire adult life- and in some neighborhoods that still haven’t transitioned- that stuff just isn’t normal.

I still think crime is acceptably pretty rare. And I’m not going to be targeted or have family targeted, so I’m not too too worried. But it’s crazy to me how it pops up everywhere. This is before we get into the “dealing with the bullshit of everyday life” like interacting with city services- which can either go weirdly smoothly, or can… not.

A Chinatown/Downtown that has BOTH that ratio of housing AND a capital one arena with the caps and wizards in it would probably be one of the most in demand neighborhoods in the region.

Creating more housing downtown solves a lot of problems. Creates a local customer base to better support retail, which was super dependent on the officer workers who aren’t coming back no matter how much Bowser whines about it. Busier streets are also less likely to fall into being hotspots for antisocial behavior like drug dealing. And obviously the region desperately needs more housing overall.

The trouble is in convincing the private market that a 95% leased residential building is better than a 60% full office building. Office rents are way higher per square foot.

Every one of the Downtown Zones has a housing requirement except D-7, which covers a couple blocks between the White House and 9th st. So if that’s the area you’re talking about then I guess you’re right but all the other D-XX zones have a housing requirement.

Because property managers typically don’t want to manage more than one kind of tenant, they’ll usually do “swaps” of the required residential and commercial space between properties in the same zone, so while the building itself might not be mixed, the area is. This is something that has to be OKd by the zoning commission (or maybe the zoning administrator? Don’t remember)

That said I do agree there’s not NEARLY enough housing downtown, and the housing ratio requirement for D zones and MU zones should be a lot higher IMO.

kx0rm0r,1bpvvu3,The-20k-Step-Bastard,"It’s adjacency. Urban designers (especially Jane Jacobs who first documented this) assert that neighborhood vibrancy comes from mixed use at all times of day. 

If Chinatown ONLY exists for sports, and only like 100 nights a year, then the remaining 2/3rds of the time is just opportunity for it to spiral. 

You’ve got 395/395 tunnels and giant faceless government buildings to the east, the lawns to the south, and the White House to the west. The only truly healthy thing around it is Mt. Vernon/Logan circle to the north, and people aren’t often walking/biking from their homes in Logan circle to the NGA every day of the week. And L’Enfant station area is the worst example of well-planned urban design, it’s a dour and desolate area of just loading docks in the side of massive office buildings. And right after that? Another highway. And THEN the Wharf. And then the water. 

If Chinatown had the Logan Circle / Mt. Vernon stuff on all four sides of it it would be the best place in the city. But shitty urban design and urban highways constricts it. 

One way to fix this would be to build massive amounts of dense housing in both Chinatown and in the rest of the city. Neighborhood competition doesn’t really happen the way you describe. It’s like the Chum Bucket and the Crusty Crab, or Bob’s Burgers versus Jimmy Pesto. In real life, relationships between businesses and neighborhoods aren’t like that. An adjacent neighborhood improving will directly improve Chinatown, because now there are more people with adjacency who will walk or bike through Chinatown in their daily lives - instead of people in Bethesda taking the red line down to watch a basketball game. 

You want organic, mixed use street life that includes early morning joggers, then construction workers going to their pre-dawn starts, then white collar people going to work, then the people at home taking their toddlers to the parks, then the office people getting lunch, then the students walking home from school, then the office people walking home after work, then the couples getting dinner, then the youngsters meeting for dates, then the party guys hitting the bars, then the high school k’noodlers kissing in the park, then the next day it starts all over again. This requires density in adjacency, better walking/biking access, better safety (more patrols, more lighting), parks, mixed use developments, easily crossable streets, and more.

IMO, You also need a neighborhood to be able to stand on its own as a mixed use place, and not just be a hanger-on. So yeah you can do all those BIG changes to the city’s infrastructure, and they’d be worthy and worthwhile changes, but I do genuinely believe you need to change a lot of the building uses IN downtown and Chinatown as well.

Even if you made minimum wage ($17/hr), after taxes you would take home $2,265 (used an online tax calculator). So even if your property doubled in value, your increase in home cost would be still 20% of net income which I think is pretty good!

DC is also very generous regarding property taxes to senior citizens and those facing hardship. And they limit how quickly taxes can be raised annually.

I know that they focus their limited resources where problems are the worst, and sometimes their hands are tied on how much they can legally do, but they aren't doing nothing.

DC has a bail system in which the City does not require people post cash bail. There is [research](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/incomejails.html) that points out that cash bail has a particularly hard hitting effect on racial minorities. Judge Morrison of DC Superior Court is a champion of this cause. He said in an interview with NPR that, [""[In 2017], we released 94 percent of all the people that we arrested without using money. Eighty-eight percent made every single court appearance, and 86 percent were never arrested for any criminal offense of any kind. And of the very small percent of people that were arrested in D.C. that we released, less than 2 percent were rearrested for a crime of violence.""](https://www.npr.org/2018/09/02/644085158/what-changed-after-d-c-ended-cash-bail) The thing I think that is interesting about his quote is that he says that ""less than 2 percent were rearrested for a crime of *violence.*"" In 2016 the Washington Post examined this and came up with the figure that [out of 100 released, 11 are rearrested, and 2 are rearrested for violent crimes,](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/when-it-comes-to-pretrial-release-few-other-jurisdictions-do-it-dcs-way/2016/07/04/8eb52134-e7d3-11e5-b0fd-073d5930a7b7_story.html) which is consistent with his claim, but more complete. That represents a 11% ~~recidivism~~ offense rate overall for those released. The data also may not paint full picture because just because someone commits a crime does not mean that they are going to get caught. It is worth noting that the same article notes that the Metro stabbing that occurred a few years ago involved a perpetrator who was released on bail 2 days prior on a misdemeanor charge. 

DC uses a computer system to calculate whether a person should be re-released or held with regard to bail. It looks at 70 factors and apparently, all things considered, operates on a presumption of release. I'd be interested in seeing what those factors are and if they are enough. It would also be interesting to see how many people are held pretrial in other jurisdictions versus DC's numbers. These incidents are really damaging to DC as a community and if this system is lax, then it needs to be ratcheted up.",48,2019,8,2,1,"1, 4"

Unfortunately DC's is just based on extremely liberal policies and what's worse is they are praised for it. There's almost no punishment for crimes there. You have repeat offenders receiving nothing other than a few weeks of unsupervised probation. Violent offenders getting released a few hours later. It's rare someone is held in jail and people know it. Most don't care if their arrested because they know they'll be out on the street in about an hour.

eyh0r73,cwurzh,NoNoNoNoNOTinks,"""I'm sick of MPD not doing anything about the PCP crisis""

LOL, are you serious?  How in the fuck do you arrive at the conclusion that police officers don't give a shit about users of PCP?  How about you put on a uniform and try to approach someone who's homicidal, crazed out of their gourd, and oblivious to tazers and pepper spray all the while having a public completely ignorant to what it means to keep this person from killing you or the public?  Yeah, you try it then come back and bitch about MPD giving no fuck's.  This case seems to be unusual in that this wasn't a career violent criminal perp who was on early parole release, probation before judgment, or some other form of justice ""reform"" bullshit where idealism is favored over the facts that early release of violent criminals oftentimes leads to those criminals physically assaulting or even murdering someone else, but we don't like to talk about those who were victims of violent criminals given third/fourth/tenth chances, nah, because there will always be collateral damage that can be justified by the end goal, right?  Nah, we just ignore people who were hurt/killed by idealism and emotional ""rationalizing,"" facts and logic be damned, and obviously the rights of a couple of violent criminals who might actually go on to not be violent again during the early release period is more important than the rights of the public who gets to deal with the violence of those who aren't going to live without being violent.  You want to stem violent crime?  Maybe get real with violent people.  Stop DAs from all these pleas to lesser charges, stop with probation before judgement on its face as the status quo, make this an offer ONLY after the violent criminal has proven they are very likely to not re-offend.  

But sure, it's the cops who are releasing violent criminals back into the public early, sure.  You've quite succinctly illustrated that you have no idea what is going on in the world of policing violent crime/criminals.",-11,2019,8,2,1,"1, 3"
