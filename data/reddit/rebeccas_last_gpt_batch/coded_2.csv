- How every neighborhood has a similar, but different vibe. Idk how to explain it but I mainly hang out at the wharf (near where I work), Capitol Hill, Dupont Circle and Shaw neighborhoods and I love them for different reasons.
- There are so many different cuisines to try! 

- The desire to support local businesses is strong.

- Communities are also really strong (i.e. the art community)

- The ability to participate in important, arguably historic protests or other types of moments is available to me at a leisure. For example, I‚Äôm able to pop over to the Supreme Court for a protest after work. This is something I really try not to take for granted.

- Cultural events! I am so, so grateful to be able to enjoy events by embassies, the Kennedy Center,  the Museums, etc. ‚Äî and any other smaller events that bring communities together. 

- The recreation in this city is fantastic. Between what you can do on the Potomac to exploring Rock Creek Park or the arboretum to just hanging out on the National Mall on a nice summer day is perfection.

j67beg4,10n3bb6,thekingoftherodeo,"Four things stand out as things I genuinely love about this area:

(1) DC has an incredible high end dining scene for its size. I'm relatively certain it has the most Michelin stars per capita in the US (if we generously associate the likes of the French Laundry with SF). The starred restaurants are also very varied in their speciality and price point, you can probably get out of Rooster & Owl with a tasting menu & a bottle of wine for ~$130pp all in while you could do Minibar and easily blow $500+ per person.

Even outside of the star circuit, you've got places like Marcel's which are superb.

(2) There are 3 relatively easily accessible airports with almost every major city covered with a direct flight. The competition also keeps a lid on prices, you'll find a flight you can afford even if you have to trek out to BWI (my least favorite of the 3 needless to say!), we aren't hub captive like folks in Charlotte would be to AA for example. 

For bonus points: you absolutely cannot beat a river visual approach into DCA sitting on the DC side on the plane, or indeed taking off to the north. A free sightseeing flight on every departure. Side note that for avgeeks here, Gravelly Point & Udvar-Hazy are fantastic to have accessible.

(3) The weather. Sure it gets hot in July/August, but we have relatively mild weather, mostly no significant disruptive events to worry about (one off derechos aside!) and a tangible 4 seasons, even if we're struggling for some powder this year.

(4) The ability to travel 3ish hours from here and get a completely different experience. NYC. Delaware/MD beaches. Shenandoah. VA vineyards. Snowshoe. Most places are lucky to have one of those things accessible.",43,2023,1,2,1,0

As a southern person who lived in suburban or rural areas most of my life, I find NYC to be a bit too chaotic and impersonal to be appealing. I always wanted to live in a big, but not too big city, and D.C. is the happy middle ground.

There are four seasons but none are too extreme. It's super walkable with robust public transportation networks. You don't need a car, but a car can be helpful. Plus we have three airports and Amtrak to connect you to other cities on the East coast, which makes it a great launchpad for getting elsewhere in the country or around the world.

Much of the shopping, food, culture, sports, arts, activity, and nightlife that can be found in large cities can be found here to some extent. D.C. is expensive but, due to it's regional nature, there is more ""value"" to be found here in terms of trade offs that must be made for the sake of lifestyle vs cost of living.

Personality wise, D.C. is slightly less superficial than places like NYC, LA, and Miami.

jzohdyh,10n3bb6,Euphoric_AlgaeGum,"Ok this is going to be a long one!  First let me speak on the crime:

YES there is crime.  These days certainly your demographic does not matter.  This is very interesting because there was a time when non-marginalized (YT) residents in DC felt they were above it all.  They could be living in a high-end neighborhoods walking there dog happily 2 blocks over from a marginalized (POC) neighborhood at 2:00 am and not worry if there was a shoot-out ensuing.  The knowing (privilege) that you would remain unharmed and protected by law enforcement because of the color the (YT) color of your  skin put these residents in box of safety.  Where crime response by law-enforcement remained biased, violent and unproductive in marginalized neighborhoods.

Today...it DONT MATTER who you are!  The color of your skin DONT MATTER!  You are not above what's going on now!   Most of the crimes are being perpetuated by youth ages 11-17.   Girls...especially are joining these crimes spree's alot more too.  And surprisely the local media are being un-biased finally in whose performing crimes in the city.  Alot of the adult robberies and murders in the DMV area are showing YT faces!  Robberies in stores, domestic violence murders, a drunken fight turned bad.  Finally, the truth, this is not new!  It's just now televised.

A large percentage of these children have been found also to be ""honor roll"" students or ""perfect attendance"" students performing crimes in their school uniforms just seeking a thrill.  Our city has been left scratching their head.  Not all of   
 these children are of marginalized backgrounds.  There is an uprise of fights and violence in the schools.  DC no longer carries the Mayor Barry Summer Youth program and the after-school working programs that was once a component to keep children off these streets and emploring values by means of employment.

This is not the old 90's crime... THIS is the new 2020's crime!

Now, other than that...  
DC is a VIBRANT CITY to live and play in.  Although the cost-of living is high as hell, but the opportunities here matches the lifestyle to afford it.  There is much gentrification taking place here but not without also adding some development value to some once marginalized areas and offering programs of living to these newly re-developed areas.  HOWEVER, it's affecting ELDERLY residents very badly with no resources to re-locate or afford what options they are being giving.  

DC has the sports, kick-ass music venues, museums, the shops, fun-bars, politics, casinos across the ways, clubs, parks, great family fun and just a wonderful diverse culture!  Marijuana can now be consumed publicly too-lol.  There is SO MUCH here.  

 We are the creators, heartbeat and home of GO-GO music! But that's another tread! lol.  New incoming residents tried to silence GO-GO music being played at city events and street corners...but that went badly!  DC Native's here that grew up on the music or are a part of the new and old bands will not be muted so they held a rally!  Another DC win!

Would i recommend moving here or visiting here from wherever you are coming from?...ABSOLUTELY!  The best knowledge is from the experience itself!

I guess it \*could\* be a good thing, but with the advent of social media bubbles I feel the last 10 years has just gotten worse and worse.  

Oh, and if you're an immigrant from outside of the U.S. from one of those ""desirable"" places (no clue what those really are) but I've had several comments in the last 4 years about being ""one of those good immigrants"".  In my head I'm like....my parents bought me here when I was 1 years of age...and we just met at the Post Office, and you know nothing about me..  Of course, my parent's culture is too polite for that so I just smile and nod politely and say nothing.  Plus I'm introverted and shy; I love a good debate but I hate arguing.",9,2021,3,2,1,0

Otherwise there‚Äôs a smattering of condos and townhouses with HOAs that are also quite expensive once total costs are factored in.

Instead, I bought in PWC a couple years ago, suck up the commute, and am saving money faster for our next house than if I rented or ate rice and beans for 6 years.

If it's any consolation:

* Re: safety - the vast majority of people who rob houses don't come back. Although of course your sense of security is shattered, many times these kinds of burglaries are almost professional. They come in, know exactly what they're looking for and leave the place trashed.
* Do you know what they took? Our burglars were focused on guns, jewelry and handbags. They could have totally taken our cars and we saw they opened the drawer with the keys in them, but the cars were untouched and all technology were untouched (didn't steal TVs - an ipad was laying on the coffee table and it was untouched.) Makes us feel a little better that they weren't going to come back and were definitely professional.
   * They even could tell the difference between the real and fake diamonds.
   * They were not interested in any identity theft type things
   * They stole small safes (pro-tip: put airtags in smaller safes that can be transported bc even if they can't access them immediately, they can take them and crack them later)
   * Knowing what they took can help sus out motives and likelihood that they'd be back
* Call the police. Although there's probably not a lot they can do, they can alert local pawn shops. They also brought in a person to sweep for prints (although they didn't find anything.) They also got a guy to come at 2am to board up our massive window that was shattered. Also they were helpful in reassuring us that most likely in our case 1) they wouldn't come back and 2) they were not looking for ID theft stuff and just wanted the guns and jewelry to sell. You will also need a police report for insurance. The cops in our case were also just super nice and understanding and gave us more info on the likely profile of the perpetrators.

For Prevention:

* alarm systems are great, even in apartment buildings. we were dumb and left ours off in a false sense of security so there was a week long window where this could have happened to us and we had no idea
* keep all receipts and list the value of any valuable items you have and would want to get insurance payouts from.
* Take pictures of jewelry/items if you have a lot of them so if it's taken you know. Sometimes you may forget what exactly was stolen
* Airtags in small safes, and understand that small safes are not a deterrent in these situations
* Be wary of who you notify when you're going out of town. People can definitely stalk but pretty much 95% of burglaries I've heard of happens when people are out of town.",18,2023,6,2,1,0

Plus they depreciate goods so like one of my handbags that I just got a month prior they were going to reimburse only like 75% so even with insurance you still have to prove a lot of stuff and that can be hard if you can't remember everything that was taken or have paper trails for everything.

We did have the serial numbers to the guns and reported them to the police so if a crime was committed with those guns they were listed as stolen.

The sucky thing was that passports were in the small safe they took, and honestly if they knew it was passports they probably wouldn't have taken it (based on what they did and didn't steal). But that was a NIGHTMARE because we were traveling internationally soon and the rush passport thing is a total shitshow right now.

Fun story - I went there for my college graduation back in 2012. We were CELEBRATING. we were a party of about 12 - my immediate family, my parents best friends, boyfriend at the time and some other people. Needless to say, we spent a lot of money. And we wanted to see the view of the Capitol on the roof. It was a Saturday and there was wedding, but the staff was amazing and was like ‚Äúyou can go up, but you have to come down immediately.‚Äù 

We go up and stand to the side to take pictures. And suddenly my dad and his best friend coming running and are like ‚Äúuh we gotta go‚Äù. They had tried to crash the wedding bar! These two boomers in their kahkis and sports coats tried to blend in at a black tie wedding. The bartender was like ‚Äúname the bride and groom‚Äù and they were like ‚Äútouch√©‚Äù 

So we go downstairs and get ready to call a million cabs bc it‚Äôs 2012 and Uber doesn‚Äôt exist. And my dad‚Äôs friend comes over and says ‚ÄúI got us a ride‚Äù and we go, ‚Äúall of us?‚Äù And he goes ‚Äúyea‚Äù 

Well, he had talked to the wedding limo and said ‚ÄúI‚Äôll pay you $100 in cash if you drive us to our hotel and we promise not to touch anything‚Äù and the driver said ‚Äúdeal, the bride and groom don‚Äôt leave for another 2 hours‚Äù. So we took the limo back to the hotel. 

Still one of the most fun nights - and I‚Äôll always have that memory. Sad to see it go - and bummed to see it sit vacant for no reason.",7,2024,11,2,1,0

lyw1wbr,1gzcsgu,_fFringe_,"I made a similar move, from Richmond District in San Francisco to Southwest DC, one block south of the beltway. It was‚Ä¶ a big change. DC is a very different city and the DMV is a very different type of region than the Bay Area. 

Personally I miss the beaches most of all. If you get the same feeling, and have a car or rent a car, you can drive out to the Chesapeake Bay, which is nice, but there is nothing like Ocean Beach or Stinson Beach. You‚Äôd have to drive out about 2-3 hours to get to Delaware or Virginia Beach and even then it‚Äôs a totally different vibe. Tons of nice parks and forests in the DMV, though. Just look on maps for green, just outside the city; most of the time it‚Äôs a public park. 

There is not a lot of independent movie theaters like in SF, the two to four screen theaters that pepper the Richmond District, not really a thing in DC. But the museums are great and there is a lot of culture here, it‚Äôs just a different vibe‚Äînot necessarily better or worse, just different. I ended up settling down here, but still miss the west coast.

Oh and the drivers are much worse here than they are in the Bay Area but the traffic is not quite as bad. Public transportation is a million times better in DC, too. Rent is just as high in the Capitol Hill area as it is in SF.

Lots of great restaurants in the city proper but once you get to the suburbs it can drop off pretty quick. Bombay Street Food has the best Indian food, Rasika a close second. Good Mexican food is a bit harder to find, compared to SF; I love Surfside and El Bebe in SW/SE, close to Capitol Hill, but only discovered them the last year before moving to Silver Spring. Sanphan for Thai food in Capital Hill. Good Italian is oddly enough really hard to find. Il Radicchio in Arlington, VA is great, my favorite, but a bit of a drive or train ride from DC. 

Pizza doesn‚Äôt compare to San Francisco. There are great pizza places here but it‚Äôs a different style altogether. Not a lot of that sloppy molten-cheese-and-sauce SF pizza that I sometimes feel like I would kill for.

Keep in mind that, traditionally, law school classes are taught using the ""socratic method,"" which involves calling on people randomly (not waiting for a raise of hands), and then basically humiliating people who cannot answer the question correctly.

However, while law school professors may ridicule an unprepared student for being unprepared, they do not attack the person per se, so they don't regress to calling attention to the physical characteristics of the student.

Woodley/Cleveland Park are both metro accessible, but Glover Park/Cathedral Heights would require a longer walk and/or buses to get around. 

As for price, you're more likely to see studios in your price range in older buildings, but on the plus side they're likely to be rent controlled so your rent won't skyrocket after the first year. Some of the buildings in these areas tend to advertise vacant units with signs outside the building instead of a website, so it can be helpful to actually explore the area in person to see possibilities.",15,2024,4,2,1,0

\- 2 in 3 D.C. residents (66 percent) are ‚Äúvery concerned‚Äù about gun violence in the area

\-Half (48 percent) say \[Very concerned\] about carjackings.

And that's whats reported. There's a lot that doesn't get reported because everybody wants things to look better.

Also heard semi-automatic fire three days ago and DC MPD basically said to my ANC that it sounded like semi-automatic fire but will never put that in a police report.

We had a shootout in the hallway. For months we‚Äôd been complaining about the stairwell being propped and random people coming and going but they ignored us. 

The story as relayed to me by a neighbor, while we were sitting on the street waiting for the police to finish clearing our floor and collecting evidence:

A local pharmaceutical retailer had his girlfriend rent a unit in the building which he then decked out with food, drinks, tvs and other amenities for his employees. They also lined the walk-in closet with multiple layers of plywood and replaced the closet door so that it could be used to securely store inventory and other supplies. To facilitate easy access to colleagues without keys or fobs they propped the doors and often also left the unit‚Äôs door slightly ajar. 

One evening, several employees were enjoying a family meal in the unit. Another employee came from the metro station to deliver inventory and collect the nightly deposit. Unarmed wholesale purchasers followed him up and, temporarily lacking funds, suggested that they take delivery of the just-delivered pharmaceuticals and cash. I‚Äôm sure they promised to send over a wire transfer just as soon as their AP department processed the correct forms. 

The delivery guy pulled out a firearm which he then promptly dropped. One of the wholesale purchasers picked up the weapon and promptly shot its owner in the ass for the discourteous behavior. The remainder of the staff then reached for whatever weapons they could find and rushed to empty them in the general direction of the fleeing wholesale buyers. 

The hallway was drenched in blood from the assless guy, who apparently was the only person hit. 

Bozzuto sent a note the next morning that ‚ÄúWe were notified of a reported altercation that resulted in one male guest being shot at the property. We are certain you share our concern for this most unfortunate situation. We encourage you to call the police if you have any information related to this incident.‚Äù Management skipped the scheduled meeting the next day.",37,2023,9,2,1,

My car was broken into (as has every single other car in my building). The ONLY place they do not have cameras is the resident portion of the garage, which I imagine is by design for one reason or another. When I inquired about the cameras, mgmt told me they feel cameras don't do anything to deter crime, and it would be pointless to have them after the car had already been broken into. What? Besides not making a lick of sense, I guess they've never heard of evidence. 

We've also had an issue with folks sleeping, shooting dope, smoking weed, etc. in the stairwells. The lock was broken on most of the stairway doors, but it took forever to be addressed (if it ever was). That, I don't mind as much as the other shit going on, but I do understand how this is a viable safety issue. Also, the fact that mgmt doesn't care, doesn't address it, and looks for new ways to squeeze money from everyone speaks volumes.

I saw someone attempt to steal a running car right in front of Trader Joe's the other night. This was at 8PM ish, when a lot of people were walkinga round and dining a few feet away. Car pulled up, ski mask guy hopped out and hopped in idling car, owner grabbed him, ski mask guy hopped in getaway car, and they blasted through a red light at 4th and Fla. This could have gone downhill fast had a firearm come into the equation.

If you look at MPD reports, there have been a lot of carjackings and armed robberies right around Union Market (and NoMa). Of course, none of the buildings will ever give residents a heads up. They just don't give a fuck. All they care about is jacking up rent and ignoring resident requests.

As someone who was here in that time period, I think that the sub doesn't get posts from the majority of us who were here then, who don't share that attitude, because we correctly identify that it's irrelevant and unhelpful to point that out. 

But seeing comments like ""the people doing drugs on the stairwell don‚Äôt bother me generally since they keep to themselves"" makes me think, why the fuck does it not bother you? Get fucking bothered. 

And while your building management may respond to incidents well, or not well, they are not the root cause of these issues, and complaining to them is not going to make any issues from the surroundings go away. If your building management was perfect, the most they could do is keep it just beyond the property line. It's an error to think they are the cause or the solution. 

These are large, cyclical problems that resist quick solutions. You feel unsafe because you are unsafe. It didn't happen overnight and it's not going to go away overnight.

-If everyone in DC acted like I do (not rape people, not assault people, not kill people) it would be literally *perfectly* safe. It's insane to blame me for a crime wave.    

-Government exists for a reason, and the very initial reason for the founding of government was to protect citizens from violence. They're barely trying.

See, I've identified your problem.  

The common problem among progressives is that they choose to theorize and attempt to break new ground rather than looking at what.. ya know.. actually *works*. As an example: DCPS is the most expensive per-student school system in the nation. It's also one of the worst. So what do all progressives in DC suggest we do? More of the same. More money! Because when they *think about it* more money should help. They've simulated it in their powerful brains, and they know the outcome. Sure, in 3 generations their super smart kids will still be fighting the same battles, but at least they won't have to admit failure, right? It's like the military industrial complex on steroids, seeing as how we spend *vastly* more on education and social programs than we do on war.  

I see you refused to answer why DC and a few other deep blue cities are the ones experiencing crime waves while all the yokels in those backwards red states are spending less, imprisoning less, policing less and still getting vastly better outcomes. But to the progressive Washingtonian, trying something new that might work, but that also might need to use someone else's old school idea is abhorrent. ""Always forward! Always progress!

*The share of those in state prison for committing violence is even greater than 55 percent, however.

So if someone is arrested for a violent crime but ends up pleading guilty to a drug charge, his crime is classified as a nonviolent drug offense, even if the underlying incident ‚Äî like a domestic violence case in which the victim won‚Äôt testify ‚Äî is the reason the prosecutor sought prison time.*",3,2020,11,2,1,

100%! I do too!  

I'm not at all against CJR in any way, shape, or form. My bone with the council is that they're spending a lot more time on easing life for 'returning citizens' than they are for the people those same citizens have assaulted, raped and murdered.  

It's not like DC has victims well taken care of. Like I mentioned earlier, I live in a neighborhood that has very recently become rough once again. Rapes, carjacked delivery drivers, etc. I am friends/family with several assault victims. Once the police take their report, they roll out and that's it. One of the victims got a card for a counselor to call. The number went to busy each time it was tried. After spending some time researching it, the victim discovered that DC claims that victims of violent crimes can get their medical bills paid. (in this case a fractured eye socket and broken rib). Guess what? 2 years later and DC is fighting to not pay. And this is a story that I've heard a hundred times.  

So what's the council doing? Passing a bill of rights for victim's of violent crime? Nope! They're trying to reduce sentencing for the small number of people that actually end up serving time. It's fucking ludicrous.  

And in any case, I don't see how any prog can handwave away the awful stats we have. (not that you are). Most of the victims of homicide are black. Most of the victims of rape are women. The crime wave isn't hurting wealthy white men. It's hurting minorities, and when anyone objects to the city's awful leadership everyone pretends they're some gentrifying force and just need to 'deal with' the crime as part of living in a city.

Most, but certainly not all, gun violence is going to be tied to certain areas of DC. Sadly, all cities have areas that are higher crime vs others, that's why looking at stats for the whole city is informative but can lead you to draw wrong conclusion (ie whole city is violent, vs pockets of violence).

As for comparing a city to a suburb, well sure, you are more likely to be a victim of crime in DC than in a suburb. But that is an odd comparison since more people usually leads to more crime, all else being equal. Someone who is used to rural living might find your sleepy suburb a hot bed of vice and violence.

Finally, it's funny how we normalize certain violence while emphasizing other violence. For example, you are far far more likely to die in a vehicle crash than you are to die being shot during a violent event. In fact, American roads have become far deadlier in the past few years.

The thing to know is that Columbia Heights is the most dense and most diverse neighborhood in the city. There are young professionals, young families, born-and-raised Black residents, a large Hispanic community, and everything else you can imagine. It‚Äôs one of the busier and louder neighborhoods. It has the most convenient transit access in the city. There are Michelin restaurants just blocks away from public housing.

If you‚Äôve lived in a ‚Äúbig city‚Äù of any kind, there won‚Äôt be much you haven‚Äôt seen before.

Yes, there‚Äôs always the risk of being a bystander, but crimes like stick-ups, robberies, etc that target DC‚Äôs ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù crowd tend to be more prevalent in neighborhoods with less foot traffic, in my experience.

Yeah‚Äîall politics are local. I‚Äôm from the state that gave us that politico. But, what can *local* do without the power to even control their own fiscal budget when there are generations of systemic racism to overcome?

DC is not a simple solution. I don‚Äôt pretend to have any sort of answer and try not to contribute more to the problem anymore than I do by being a white yankee transplant to DC. Laying this insanely complex problem on local government to solve? (And trust me‚Äîbeing on the old Columbia Heights yahoo group was an eye opener on ANC history and how long many community activists have been fighting...)

h9wixvq,p90h2e,129za,"That‚Äôs fair enough. But Georgetown isn‚Äôt Glover Park. That‚Äôs like bringing Adams Morgan into the chat about CH. 

Glover Park is quiet death. It‚Äôs beautiful. But it‚Äôs not city life as many will recognise. Mount Pleasant and Kalorama have more life in them than GP. And they‚Äôre quieter spots. If you‚Äôve come from a place where you expect great restaurants, mixed communities and walkable streets then Ward 1 will be for you. There will be blocks in CH that you won‚Äôt want to live on but that‚Äôs what happens when you live somewhere without oppressive segregation. The fact is, go to a block that people in this thread think is sketchy and walk two blocks away and you‚Äôre somewhere with fantastic restaurants or coffee shops or million dollar homes.

I‚Äôve been harsh on GP and other places like it. If you want a quiet life in the city with trees and great schools and you‚Äôre willing to drive then it‚Äôs great too.  But what a lot of people seem to buy saying is that poverty scares them (even when side by side with great wealth) and they would like to be able to isolate themselves from that.",1,2021,8,2,1,

ha47cuq,p90h2e,CaptainObvious110,"What I wish is that people would stop acting like they are better than those that are not as well off financially as they are or are of a different race than they are.  Every black man is not a thug after all. How do I know? Because I am one of them and certainly do not identify with that lifestyle at all.

Despite Columbia Heights appearing to be melting pot of cultures upon closure look it simply is not the case.  There seems to be a lack of interest in the new white residents in getting to know their new neighborhood and the people who have been there for years.  This air of aloofness is really annoying to me and the insistence on making an area appeal to them rather than integrating into the fabric of the neighborhood is something I call ""the Columbus Effect"" 

Why do I call it that? Well I already answered that in part above.  

Is it wrong to want to live somewhere that you don't have to worry about someone constantly begging you for money? No, not at all.  Is it wrong to not want to live around an open air drug market?  Of course not.

But here's the thing....If people took the time to learn about the neighborhood they intend to move into, then they would already know whether or not that is the neighborhood for them.  As mentioned, it may be that one part of the neighborhood is concerning but another part isn't and that's cool but you won't know if you don't invest a measure of time to understand the people that are already there.

I can speak on this because I have been there and done that.  I took the time to learn and take in the sights at different times and was able to move somewhere that has brought me a lot of happiness instead of misery. I've lived in places where random people would be sitting on the steps and would be in the way when you are trying to enter or leave the apartment building.  

I hate that.

I don't want to be around an area known for drug activity because that brings with it a measure of violence and drama that I want nothing to do with.  

I lived in the Trinidad neighborhood back in the mid 90's and thank goodness I didn't know that many nights what I was hearing was gunshots. I had moved there from NW just to the west of Columbia Heights and so it was definitely a different area than what I was used to.

The fact that an area can change quickly I can attest to because there was a riot in Mt Pleasant back in the early 90's that I didn't find out about until I was an adult even though I was close by.  

Best believe that when I was looking for an apartment I wanted something different. Somewhere I would feel comfortable for my friends and family to be able to walk down the street without being concerned about their safety. 

I get that. 

But what I don't get is the paranoia that has it's root on ignorance and the unwillingness to learn and to grow.",4,2021,8,2,1,
