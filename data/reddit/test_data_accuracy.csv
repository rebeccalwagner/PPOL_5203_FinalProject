If you want popular locations in DC for the higher end of your range look into *possibly* private english basements, decreasing your rent by grabbing a roommate(s) or giving up your car to increase your rent costs. 

To put it into perspective I think a traditional 500 sq foot 1 br/1 ba in central areas of DC/Arlington/Alexandria (also keep in mind yellow/blue lines are cut off from Alexandria for the forseeable future) go for about 2400/2500 and maybe a jr 1 br for 2200.

I'm not saying it's acceptable but the reality is these things can take a little while. Definitely stay on top of them, though.    


The good news is in my experience robberies on the train are usually very strong cases because the surveillance video on the newer trains is incredibly high quality.  Whenever I've had cases from them they are able to give me high quality video tracking the suspects from the time they walk into the station until they walk out.

To be clear, if safety is the #1 priority, you may be interested to look in Northern Virginia as well, in Arlington or Alexandria.

U Street and Shaw have a lot of action (i.e., bars and restaurants) but can be rowdy on the weekend nights. Eastern Market and H Street also have a lot going on.

Easy walk to DuPont, U Street, Woodley and Cleveland Park. Can even make it to Farragut easily. You then also have access to the red, yellow, and green line and some of the best bus lines the Hs and the 16th street ones. Basically all of DC is pretty easily accessible and the row houses and town homes are cute to walk around. You can also easily get to National Airport and Virginia if you ever want. DC is a really green city, so almost every street is tree lined especially back in the neighborhood bits. Your budget would be more than enough there too. Probably have plenty leftover for a pint.

But a lot of times they drift the topic to them not liking to drive to specific areas because of crime. Last time I took an Uber, the guy told me he won’t drive in Baltimore anymore, because he got robbed twice in a span of a few months and SE for him is no different than Baltimore, so he’ll just cancel the requests to those areas. As a tip, what I occasionally do is, when I need to go EotR, I request a driver to a different destination. Then I ask them whether they would be willing to take me to southeast instead, offering cash without an official order.

118,40,40,cjzlujp,2ehmac,_Every_Damn_Time_,"I think the area is relatively safe - some people may call out or say rude things but if you ignore them it is fine. Then again, I didn't have an issue walking down North Capitol in NW/NE at night last year when I lived in the area or on H street a few years ago. 

As for the bus, I think buses are great! I've never had any major issues and any time someone has gotten out of hand (such as shouting or swearing a lot) the bus driver told the person to knock it off or they would kick them off. 

Or consider getting a bike or Capital Bikeshare membership - I use bikeshare to get from the metro to work (about 1 mile) and it is great!

Three thoughts:

1. Do not get into a set routine - leaving and/or coming home at the same time every day and taking the same exact route every day is a mistake anywhere. I feel very safe where I live (and my fiance is a 6' tall big guy with a beard) but I still make a point to vary my routine one day every week or two - leave 15 minutes earlier, come home slightly later, stop at the grocery store randomly, etc.

2. Consider carrying pepper spray or some other similar option. I used to in college, don't feel the need to anymore. I never needed it but it made me feel safer at the time. It also gave me more confidence and a better ""don't fuck with me"" attitude. Which leads me to ... 

3. If you walk around like you know where you are going and do not want anyone to mess with you most people will leave you alone. If you are staring at your phone (or otherwise distracted), looking around like you are lost, or are just generally unsure then it draws more attention.

Welcome to DC - I love it here, I've rarely have issues beyond someone being obnoxious/rude and a few car break-ins when I've done stupid shit like leave an empty backpack in the back seat.
