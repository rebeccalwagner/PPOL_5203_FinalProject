It is good news we have a very short term (six month) decline, but it is not drastic, it is a small reversal of a long term drastic increase. Look at homicide rate of 2013 compared to 2023 (last complete year). And the reversal is based on nearly double the number of people incarcerated and there is growing pressure to again reduce incarceration numbers",3,2024,07,1

196sio2,SuperBethesda,"DC does have the lowest property taxes in the country. Regarding commute, it depends on your situation. 

In my case, my employer pays for Metro. I live next to the Metro station and my DC office is also next to a station. So this arrangement may actually be more convenient than locations in DC without access to Metro. I do have an option for employer provided garage parking space at the office, which I don‚Äôt use.",1,2024,01,1
