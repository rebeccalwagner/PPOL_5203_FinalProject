5,lc9jm5a,1dwhdrj,TheThe1088,"DC violent crime is up though 15, ten and five year trends. It is good news we have a very short term (six month) decline, but it is not drastic, it is a small reversal of a long term drastic increase. Look at homicide rate of 2013 compared to 2023 (last complete year). And the reversal is based on nearly double the number of people incarcerated and there is growing pressure to again reduce incarceration numbers",3,2024,7,1
