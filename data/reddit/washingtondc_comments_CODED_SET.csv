She got something called the Citizen App, which is even more extreme than a local Next Door because it's solely for crime notifications. Ever since getting this app she constantly talks about how unsafe she feels, she suspects the worst from random people walking down the street, and she installed an expensive security system.

Many of her neighbors use the same app and are similarly on alert for absolutely no good reason.",2023,3,51,0

Crime upticks in the summer. It always does, and it always will so long as we live in a city that criminalizes poverty, has only seriously built housing for the city's professional class, consistently harrass and disturb settlements of houseless folks, and fail to provide adequate levels of housing and mental health support. Until those problems are fixed, you will continue to see ""crazy shit."" The city has never seriously addressed the poverty that has plagued the city since the '70s. Can't build over our problems (when the only buildings coming up are giant yuppie caves).

Of course, none of this discounts being held-up or threatened with your life. Sorry that happened. But it's a city, and weird shit happens. 

Just to add, I live up in Park View now. There are many houseless and tweaky folks kicking around as there always have been, **but I've personally never felt more safe in this city.** The places where people actually live - with community institutions and parks and neighbors - feel more united than I've ever seen.

I'm not saying it's acceptable but the reality is these things can take a little while. Definitely stay on top of them, though.    


The good news is in my experience robberies on the train are usually very strong cases because the surveillance video on the newer trains is incredibly high quality.  Whenever I've had cases from them they are able to give me high quality video tracking the suspects from the time they walk into the station until they walk out.

Yes, it is outside the city proper but public transit here is good and both have cute neighborhoods where you will get more for your money. U Street and Shaw have a lot of action (i.e., bars and restaurants) but can be rowdy on the weekend nights. Eastern Market and H Street also have a lot going on.

You then also have access to the red, yellow, and green line and some of the best bus lines the Hs and the 16th street ones. Basically all of DC is pretty easily accessible and the row houses and town homes are cute to walk around. You can also easily get to National Airport and Virginia if you ever want.

I like to ask drivers what their craziest experiences were (more interested in funny party stories than crime stories) when driving Uber/Lyft/cab. But a lot of times they drift the topic to them not liking to drive to specific areas because of crime. Last time I took an Uber, the guy told me he won’t drive in Baltimore anymore, because he got robbed twice in a span of a few months and SE for him is no different than Baltimore, so he’ll just cancel the requests to those areas. As a tip, what I occasionally do is, when I need to go EotR, I request a driver to a different destination.

40,cjzlujp,2ehmac,_Every_Damn_Time_,"I think the area is relatively safe - some people may call out or say rude things but if you ignore them it is fine. Then again, I didn't have an issue walking down North Capitol in NW/NE at night last year when I lived in the area or on H street a few years ago. 

As for the bus, I think buses are great! I've never had any major issues and any time someone has gotten out of hand (such as shouting or swearing a lot) the bus driver told the person to knock it off or they would kick them off. 

Or consider getting a bike or Capital Bikeshare membership - I use bikeshare to get from the metro to work (about 1 mile) and it is great!

Three thoughts:

1. Do not get into a set routine - leaving and/or coming home at the same time every day and taking the same exact route every day is a mistake anywhere. I feel very safe where I live (and my fiance is a 6' tall big guy with a beard) but I still make a point to vary my routine one day every week or two - leave 15 minutes earlier, come home slightly later, stop at the grocery store randomly, etc.

2. Consider carrying pepper spray or some other similar option. I used to in college, don't feel the need to anymore. I never needed it but it made me feel safer at the time. It also gave me more confidence and a better ""don't fuck with me"" attitude. Which leads me to ... 

3. If you walk around like you know where you are going and do not want anyone to mess with you most people will leave you alone. If you are staring at your phone (or otherwise distracted), looking around like you are lost, or are just generally unsure then it draws more attention.

Welcome to DC - I love it here, I've rarely have issues beyond someone being obnoxious/rude and a few car break-ins when I've done stupid shit like leave an empty backpack in the back seat.
