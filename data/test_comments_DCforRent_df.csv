It’s about 10 minutes from my door to the train platform, and there’s a Giant grocery store with a solid selection. I think there’s also a Safeway, but I’ve never been. There’s a new urgent care, a CVS, some reasonable (for DC) priced restaurants and some upscale restaurants, some gyms, and a UPS off the top of my head. Really the only thing I miss is a bank - there was a Wells Fargo nearby two years ago, but it’s been gone.

Where I live, you can go in one direction to make your way into the heart of the city, or you can go the other to get to nature. I live across the street from a park, and it’s about half a mile to Rock Creek Park. It’s usually pretty quiet here, for the city.

I am a full time student and work full time. It’s tough sometimes for me without any familial support, but I have been here two years. It’s only getting better as time goes on. You sound as if you’re in a much stronger financial position than me, so you’d do well here.

Finally, I can’t answer this perfectly for you as a man, but nighttime is generally safe here, for the city. I am a night owl and will walk at night during warm months (talking anytime between 8 PM and 1 AM) - I haven’t had any problems. But again, I’m a man.",2,2023,10

As for location and buildings, you have to get away from the luxury type of buildings in NoMa/H Street/Navy Yard etc. Find the older buildings in the NW that the other person mentioned, because they will have bigger for the same cost or even less money. They will have rent control. They might have very basic amenities like a small gym but they have what is necessary like a laundry room and often a front desk concierge person and package receiving.

I have lived in DC for several years and generally recommend Bloomingdale or Takoma Park (in Maryland) area for people who like a mix. For those who want to live more outside the city and have a car, Woodbridge, VA is a nice place.

I have friends who stay at ""luxury"" or very nice apartments yet they struggle to get maintenance in or noise problems resolved. They also get hidden fees. My recommendation is to rent from people, not companies. Currently, I am helping my landlord find a new tenant for this unit in Columbia Heights, which is in DC but quieter. I wouldn't walk around at night as I am a cautious risk averse women, but this neighborhood, and Petwoth, are super nice for being ""in"" the city.

Even in this time, people have had to literally move to different buildings because they can’t get the deals that they’re offering new tenants right now if they’re already there. Total bullshit. And in DC, once your year lease is up, you automatically go to month-to-month but these buildings force you to sign on for a year or two if you want to keep a decent rent. So the place that I mentioned with Yarmouth, not only did they not raise my rent, but they let me go month to month after my year was up.",3,2020,11

158,8u1vhu,whatchyamaca11it,"No problem, hate to be a downer. I wouldn’t give up on looking for that rent, but it is very unlikely you’ll find something in those areas at $1000. $1200 is possible if you are okay with doing a 3br/1ba and sharing the bathroom. 

The fact you are only looking for 6 months and want something that starts next week will also make it much more difficult although I’m sure you’re already aware of that. 

I would suggest looking at Columbia Heights or Petworth for better deals. 

I’d also suggest looking on Craigslist. I know it can be sketchy but you can get lucky. My current place I have I consider a great deal and my friend found it by contacting a Craigslist post that had no pictures and very little info.

Out of the three neighborhoods you specified, Silver spring is going to be where you find the cheapest places to rent. It is not close to Downtown DC though.

If you are open to the idea of living in a studio then you will have quite a few options in NW DC.
