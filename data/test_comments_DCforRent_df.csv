http://www.titanoftrinidad.com/2013/06/mpd-hiding-most-crimes-from-public/

Perusing the comments on wapo, the various neighborhood blogs, and /r/washingtondc reveals many instances of MPD either flat-out discouraging citizens from reporting crimes or incorrectly categorizing incidents like theft as lost property instead.",2,2014,03
1,20t3z6,AUBlazin,I completely understand and believe what you are saying. At the least I think this map could give you an idea of crime amount in certain areas as compared to others.,2,2014,03

5,y57cbw,dcgirlsmallworld,"If you are looking for a quiet neighborhood with an older population, I would stay far away from Navy Yard. Navy Yard is notorious for having a younger and frattier population. Capitol Hill probably fits your description the best (especially around Eastern Market). I would also take a look at Bloomingdale which is about a 10 minute walk to the bars in Shaw.",3,2022,10
6,y57cbw,eeek0711,I lived in the DeLano Apartments in Woodley Park and itâ€™s most exactly what youâ€™re looking for,2,2022,10
7,y57cbw,samthehaggis,"Agreed to Cleveland Park and Woodley Park. There are plenty of condo/apartment buildings in the area and it's very calm and leafy while still having easy access to the Metro, supermarkets, and restaurants.",1,2022,10

9,y57cbw,rshorn,Hill East is great! Lived there for three years up until this past June. Tree and row home lined streets with lots of young families. Close to eastern market and Capitol Hill. (Iâ€™m also renting out my condo there if youâ€™re interested ðŸ˜¬. 2br2/2bth),1,2022,11
