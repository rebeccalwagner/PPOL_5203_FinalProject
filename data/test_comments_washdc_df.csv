2,1eg7a93,Zoroasker,"I live in the general vicinity. It‚Äôs relatively safe. The further you are away from Benning Road the better. The main transit options in the immediate vicinity are the X2 and Streetcar. I would not want to be a young woman riding solo on the X2 eastbound after dark.

Kingman Park is more of a quiet family neighborhood, so I‚Äôm not sure it would be my first choice as a young person. That said, while I sometimes ride the X9 express bus I don‚Äôt really ride the X2 and only occasionally ride the streetcar. It is worth noting, however, that if you get CapitalBikeshare it‚Äôs maybe 6-8 minutes to Stadium-Armory Metro and there are protected bike lanes the whole way until you leave 19th.",6,2024,07
3,1eg7a93,,Go walk it at day and then at night,5,2024,07
4,1eg7a93,PigeonParadiso,"Please look at DC crime maps and go based on that information. Have you been there? 

If the truth is told, we‚Äôre refuted, if we say a neighborhood is safe, someone will refute that too.",12,2024,07
5,1eg7a93,PPPP4MU,I‚Äôd think again,11,2024,07
6,1eg7a93,80211n,"I was an IT field tech years ago and we had a contract with various businesses in DC. We were told under no circumstances for our safety, don't take evening calls in certain areas, Benning Rd being in that list. Even during the day it could be sketch.",9,2024,07
7,1eg7a93,Away-Opinion-8540,I can't think of a single college night activity on Benning rd. The neighborhood you are in is generally fine if you have a car. The actual area isn't really a bar scene. I'd recommend looking further south (look past East Capitol) or go west to 14th NW.,5,2024,07
8,1eg7a93,Sea-Ad3724,I‚Äôm not an expert but I hear about a lot of crime along Benning Rd NE,7,2024,07
9,1eg7a93,Healthy-Side-2114,"I did go there to tour the place and I was a little thrown off by the Benning road area(the blocks of the townhouses nearby seemed fairly normal).  Other than my tour, I‚Äôve never been down that way before. The furthest I‚Äôve gone is H & 8th NE and not going to lie when I got to Benning road it was starting to look a little rough. But DC is kind of ghetto as a whole so I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm over thinking it. The fact that the home is well priced but has been on the market for a longgg time now is also throwing me off. Most of the other homes I looked at all around dc were taken within a week or 2 but this has just been sitting so it‚Äôs making me question the area even more‚Ä¶ Plus the Uber guy I was with told me Benning road was dangerous so I don‚Äôt know anymore.",7,2024,07
10,1eg7a93,lizardedin,"If this is the only area you can afford to live in, then it appears you‚Äôre just as ‚Äúghetto‚Äù as the people you‚Äôre worried about living around.

You‚Äôre no better than anyone. Hope this helps :)",5,2024,07
11,1eg7a93,Worried_Crow_9426,No,2,2024,08
12,1eg7a93,Miserable-Energy8844,Yea its pretty safe.  Never had a problem while buying my crack there.,2,2024,08
13,1eg7a93,Negative_Fee1310,Northeast and safe don't belong in the same sentence,3,2024,07
14,1eg7a93,,Nope,2,2024,07
15,1eg7a93,Playful-Translator49,"I love Kingman park been here since 2006. I‚Äôm a female not that it really matters. I take the x2, streetcar and metro all the time as well as the D6",2,2024,07
16,1eg7a93,Speshulted,"I live here. It's like any neighborhood in transition. You'll need to be aware of your surroundings at times, but it's a good neighborhood.",0,2024,07
17,1eg7a93,,"It‚Äôs a great neighborhood. Lived there for over 10 years with 2 young kids. Like another poster said, Benning Rd. is pretty sketchy and I generally steered clear but like many neighborhoods in many cities a block or 2 can make a world of difference. I have a car but the Stadium Armory metro is a short walk so I generally stayed away from the buses and only took the streetcar in the day. The worst crime that happened to me was littering and the occasional dog shit in front of my house. If the house is in decent shape I‚Äôd go for it and take an Uber if going out at night.",0,2024,07
18,1eg7a93,heyzeuseeglayseeus,"This sub‚Äôs official stance is ‚ÄúNO, DC IS A SUPER TERRIFYING HORRIFYING PLACE OF CRIME AND NOTHING ELSE EVERYONE‚ÄôS BEING MURDERED AND ROBBED AND NO CRIMES ARE ADDRESSED BY OFFICIALS OR PROSECUTED (also racism doesn‚Äôt exist)‚Äù",-6,2024,07
19,1eg7a93,trippygg,Most of the comments say it's not that safe. I've driven by there and I'd pass.,5,2024,07
20,1eg7a93,Healthy-Side-2114,"No nothing to do there but I just meant like if we were coming back home at night on the bus or walking down the street or something, would it be safe? Cause at my apartment where I used to live we walked back home from the bus stop sometimes after going out.",3,2024,07
21,1eg7a93,Speshulted,Benning road is a no-go. It's pretty bad.,10,2024,07
22,1eg7a93,PigeonParadiso,"I‚Äôd take a hard pass as well, but I don‚Äôt want the hostile redditors in this sub after me.",2,2024,07
23,1eg7a93,trippygg,"Honestly, I'm not sure if this is even a legit post with college girls, college night life activities, and the bus on Benning lol",4,2024,07
24,1eg7a93,Healthy-Side-2114,"üò≠why wouldn‚Äôt it be? We‚Äôre literally 4 friends. We‚Äôre just broke lol. But I think I get the gist of it now. Benning road, BAD",4,2024,07
25,1eg7a93,trippygg,What's your budget? Also prices are higher in the summer.,0,2024,07
