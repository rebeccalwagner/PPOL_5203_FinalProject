DDOT stands by the closure of the sidewalk because Park Van Ness's construction includes a parking garage that will exist underneath where the sidewalk is and thus providing support and structural integrity to the sidewalk. While under construction, because the garage wasn't there to completely support the weight of the sidewalk, the sidewalk had to close, or else would collapse under the weight of pedestrians.

I feel safer here then I did living directly behind h and 13th, mainly because theres less drunk foot traffic. The neighbors are friendly and a good mix of old and new, get to know them well. The police are actively showing much more presence, you will actually have a cop sitting on 18th and h just about all day and all night.  They also have two or three patrol cars sitting at the starburst corner just about every night and it’s made a significant difference in not just feeling safer but also much less trash flying around.  
One thing to consider though is  schooling especially if your looking to purchase. it’s less then desirable for your feed school. You could go through the lottery  but it’s no guarantee.

We live on 20th, and it is very, very quiet, hardly any foot or car traffic except for locals. 19th Street seems to be a little nosier since it is the entrance to the neighborhood from the bus and street car, it is also a through street up to Maryland avenue; also 19th and Benning is a pretty active corner. Our neighbors are very friendly and are mix of an older generation who have lived here for years and a younger generation moving in. 

We frequently go out on H street and feel safe walking to the street car or bus to go out. However like some already mentioned we almost always grab an uber/lyft home instead of walking home from the street car when we stay out late at night.

We do hear the occasional gun shots at night, but they are usually east on 21st Street. We feel we got good value for the home we bought compared to similar size houses in neighborhoods we could no longer afford.

4x66gz,CaptainObvious110,Yes. Reasonably safe as in not exactly Glover park or woodley park safe but I would say pretty good compared to Columbia Heights which is to the east especially the south east,1,2016,08
4x66gz,drr1971,"""...compared to Columbia Heights...""  Well compared to Hitler, Trump isn't the worst....but that's not the kind of bar I want to measure things by.",1,2016,08
4x66gz,CaptainObvious110,"LOL! Honestly, I don't feel unsafe in Mt Pleasant. Yes there are guys that like to loiter around the 7-11 but they don't do anything but hang out there.  What I find funny is the fact that ""no loitering"" is in english and spanish and no one cares at all for some reason.   
I told you I have lived in different parts of the city and I have been to most of it at various times even back in the 90's when crime was a lot worse.  So I know what I am talking about.

Nowhere is ""safe."" I've had friends get mugged in Bethesda, it's a city, there's public transit.",3,2012,10

10u4pz,brockboland,"If you're flying on weekdays, I would stay in DC: the MARC train goes from Union Station right to BWI for about $12, and that's the easiest way to get between DC and BWI.

It doesn't run on weekends, though, so you may wind up paying for a cab (I wouldn't) or take the bus from BWI (few bucks, 40 minutes or so) to Greenbelt, and then ride the Metro into the city (again: few bucks, 40 minutes or so).",1,2012,10

10u4pz,jigga19,"You know, I'll give you that.  I think it's a reasonable question to ask, though, but there's perhaps an equally implied tone of racism regardless.  However, I still think that the map is entirely outdated.  I live in NE and feel perfectly safe.   ",1,2012,10
