16hpztv,Where would you buy in DC to feel most safe about your urban family walking around the neighborhood for daily life-long term?,"Would the northern part of Georgetown/Glover Park be the best combo of urbanity, walkability, and safety in DC? 

We’ve rented for 10 years and don’t drive as we both work near the the White House. 

We want to move somewhere more long term where we can feel less anxious on our early morning and late evening walks in our neighborhood.  Tiny is ok for us.",2023,09

ih2u1o,How safe is the Old City/Near-Northeast neighborhood?,"I'm thinking about signing a lease on a place near L and 6th ST NE. I've been living in a ""safer"" part of Capitol Hill for a few years  and I've been wanting a larger place and I've noticed a good selection of large apartments for rent in that area.

However, I did notice on the crime maps that there has been 2 homicides within four blocks of this intersection in the last 9 months and a couple robberies. The killings seem targeted but they obviously make me somewhat concerned. I just want to make sure I am chill with the safety of the area before I sign the lease.

I've walked the area a few times at night and it doesn't seem too bad but I have no idea how it was pre-Covid19 outside of just the data from the crime maps.

**I'd really appreciate it if people who visit/live/lived in this area tell me how safe they think it is.**

Basically, I want to be able to walk to and back from the NOMA-Galludet metro station between 9-11:30 pm without endangering myself and I want to be able to walk to H street between 9-11:30pm without endangering myself. I realize, like in many areas of the city, it may be unsafe to walk back several blocks after 12:30am.

Also, I'm a guy, which is sadly relevant when it comes to safety.",2020,08
chffj1,Late 20’s couple moving from CO to DC looking for relatively safe neighborhood to move to in 1300 to 1500 price range.,"My girlfriend and I have moved to the DMV area for work and are looking for a place to live in DC.  We are currently in Reston until we find a place of our own.
We want to move to DC specifically to be in the city for things to do, culture, community, etc.  we just don’t have any reference on relatively safe neighborhoods to look at. I understand we won’t get much with our budget, but being in the city is more important for us than square footage.  
We have also looked at Silver Spring but feel like the downtown isn’t what we’re looking for.  We have seem to only find big company stores and generic malls. Any help would be appreciated. Also, if you find that we’re mistaken about silver spring or surrounding areas, please let us know.  Takoma Park looked nice but other than that, we haven’t visited much else.",2019,07
rigywa,Considering buying EOTR in Buena Vista/Historic Anacostia near the metro. Do folks know any streets or parts of the neighborhood that are more walkable/safe at night?

1k3768,Is this neighborhood safe? And questions on group house etiquette...,"Have an offer to join a group house (4 people total) on 10th and I. The price is really awesome for how nice the house is, but I'm trying to figure out the neighborhood, which I've heard can be sketchy. I'm a pretty diminutive female, so I want to be extra sure (have also looked [this map](http://www.spotcrime.com/dc/washington) and [this map](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:http://www.sarahkhank.com/crime_map.htm)). It's also not super metro accessible, so I'll probably be walking from Union Station or bussing a great deal. Should I be worried? 

Also, I've never gone through the whole DC group house process before. Now that I have an offer, surely it isn't binding? I'm still weighing several options, so how long should I take to make a decision (I'm thinking one or two days)? And are they going to be incredibly offended if I say no? ",2013,08
26ozwk,"Where to buy a house in DC? What is a good, relatively cheap neighborhood that is safe enough to walk to/from the metro?","We moved to DC in Feb and decided to rent in the city for the first year so we could get the lay of the land. We have a 2 bed apt near Logan Circle. I've started looking around at the market and places over here are going for the $1M price point. That is ridiculous. 
I am considering moving somewhere else within the city limits, and either buying a fixer upper, or getting something that is already renovated.
But where? We'd like to be within walking of a metro stop and have a supermarket nearby. I think they are the 2 most important things.",2014,05

Which neighborhoods should I be looking for? Ideally, it would be located somewhere between BWI Airport and downtown as I'll be flying in and will be limited to public transit / cabs. Thank you!

487cur,Brentwood/Gallaudet neighborhood... Safe place to move for family?,"Thinking of renting an apartment around here, but not too familiar with the NE side of town.  We are young-30 something, white, couple with a young baby.  The closest (rhode island ave) metro is not super close, so we would be biking and taking bus/uber/driving mostly.  I regularly carry with me my laptop and other electronic equipment for work, and regularly come home late at night.  I've lived in plenty of somewhat shady areas before so not super paranoid in general, but this part of town is still foreign to me.  Anyone live around there who could offer some insight?",2016,02
