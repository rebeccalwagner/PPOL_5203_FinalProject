I'm pretty aware of my surroundings and would think that I can defend myself in most situations. That said, I am petite and would feel like I am an easy target for those that are looking for one, if I happen to be walking alone. I wouldn't walk on my own after dark. I'd likely take a cab or Uber home if it's late and I'm alone, and I carry pepper spray with me at all times.

I have been looking at studios and 1 bedrooms in Eastern Market, though many places that advertise as Eastern Market are really closer to Trinidad which doesn't have a great reputation.

1fbmdlr,Room in Glover Park 2bd/2ba,"I am looking for someone to take over my lease in a 2 bed 1 bath apartment in Glover Park starting in the middle of October 2024 (date flexible). The lease term ends in May 2025, but it is open to renewal. Rent is $1075 a month plus utilities (which average around $80-$100 a month, sometimes less). This room is the bigger of the two included in the unit. 

The kitchen in the unit would come mostly furnished, and the common area will be furnished by both you and the current roommate. Most of the items in the room itself (the room with the blue carpet) will not be included. 

A bit more about the space:
The unit is small but cozy, with a full kitchen, living room, and mudroom / storage room / potential sunroom. There’s a newly renovated balcony that is really nice for hosting!
Parking is available for around $100/month, if you have a car. There is also plenty of parking space. 
It is located right next to Glover Park, about a 25 minute walk north from Georgetown.
Trader Joe’s and Safeway are both within easy walking distance.
The space has easy access to the D2, D6, and 33 bus lines. The D2 line takes you to DuPont circle, straight to the red metro line. The 33 line takes you from Friendship Heights to the national Mall area.
The neighborhood is super friendly and very walkable. I often go on walks later in the evening and always feel safe.
The landlady is nice and responsive to maintenance requests.

The current roommate is a guy in his mid-20s, working in consulting.

What we’re looking for: 
A working professional in mid to late 20’s. 
Preferably no pets. 
Someone who values cleanliness, communication, and a respect for private spaces/time.

1dljgkt,"Bedroom in prime Columbia Heights rowhouse, $1075 per month starting August 1st","Hello!

I’m moving away from DC to do a Fulbright and am looking for a sublease/lease takeover for my bedroom in a lovely rowhouse right in the center of Columbia Heights.

This is a three-bedroom rowhouse with one full bathroom upstairs and one half bathroom downstairs. My room is the middle room, but still a great size. It has one nice north-facing window which looks out onto the backyard and the next street and gets good light. The window sits in front of a nook, which is where I have my desk, though you could also easily rearrange things. The rest of the room is rectangular, with hardwood flooring, and also has a huge walk-in closet with built-in shelves and racks for hanging clothes on both sides, as well as plenty of space for extra storage. There are plenty of outlets for extra lamps in addition to the overhead light.

Upstairs alongside the other two bedrooms, the bathroom has nice tile floors, a full tub with a huge flat fixed showerhead and removable showerhead, and a modern wood vanity and large mirror. The bathroom also has a huge skylight which gives it great natural light throughout the day. In the upstairs hallway, there is another nook for the modern washing machine and dryer, along with an even bigger skylight for natural light. The hardwood floors also continue throughout, including downstairs in the spacious entrance hallway, living room, and dining room.

My favorite part of the house is the kitchen, which has a gas stove, great counter space, a massive island, tons of cabinets and drawers for storage, and modern refrigerator, microwave, dishwasher, and other small appliances. The kitchen looks out into the backyard through a wide sliding screened window and glass door. The backyard itself is a good size and fenced in, with tables both on the balcony and below (though we’re in the process of cleaning in the pictures).

The house is old but in good shape. It’s owned by a private landlord, a family with kids who used to live here as their personal residence before they moved to another neighborhood in DC. The dad still handles all the maintenance and is generally very responsive. The other roommates are two young professionals in their late twenties (both men), one an embassy employee and the other a software developer. Both are very nice and easy to get along with!

The house is located on Monroe Street in Columbia Heights, on a very quiet and safe street with lots of families. It’s just around the corner from Columbia Heights Plaza and all the amenities there: a 3 minute walk to the Columbia Heights metro station on the Green Line, 2 minutes to three different grocery stores (Target, Giant, and Lidl), and also surrounded by lots of great restaurants. It’s also about a 7 minute walk to the heart of Mount Pleasant.

I’m looking to sublease my room starting August 1. My lease runs until September 30, so a 2-month term and it’s for $1,075 per month + utilities. You would almost certainly have the option to sign a full 1-year lease following the sublease and starting October 1 if you wanted. The landlord would also likely be willing to start a 1-year lease on August 1 if you’d prefer, as each of the bedrooms is on a separate lease and term.

Let me know if you’re interested and would like to tour in-person or virtually! You’d then meet the roommates and would have to do a quick check with the landlord. And I’m happy to answer any other questions you might have.

1cvsvu4,Lease takeover - own bedroom and bathroom in 2bd/2ba apartment right next to the red line - $1630 per month. Free rent in June.,"\*\*Key details\*\* 

This is 1 bedroom and 1 bathroom in a shared 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom apartment. Your share of the rent would be $1630 a month + utilities (which are usually around $60 a month including internet). Available for move in anytime between now and start of July. June is also FREE if moving in after the 4th. This is a lease takeover, with the lease lasting until May 4th 2025. 

\*\*About the apartment\*\* 

Modern apartment with 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. Your bathroom isn't en-suite but is about 1 yard from your bedroom door. Bedroom is spacious with comfortably enough room for a queen bed and furniture. There's also a built in closet. There is a washer/dryer in unit, dishwasher and central AC and heating. The apartment also has a balcony overlooking the courtyard. 

\*\*About the building\*\* 

Wisconsin Place is the best place I've ever lived. Very modern building, with great amenities including: in-building gym with new equipment, a cinema room, a cafe area with Macs, a rooftop pool and a business center with free printing. All are free to use for residents. The 24 hour reception is also super useful for making sure your packages and things are super safe. The building has an attached parking garage which it shares with a Whole Foods and Friendship Heights metro station. That means you are incredibly close to the metro and on humid/rainy days you don't even have to go outside to catch the red line downtown. The building has a 4.8 rating on Google, which is amazing for an apartment building, and honestly, I'd say that's accurate. 

\*\*The roommate\*\* 

Jason, my roommate, is staying on in the other room. He's great and one of the best roommates I've had. In his late 20s, works at a local university while also doing his master's there. You'll also be living with his labradoodle who is incredibly friendly and always down for sofa pets. 

\*\*Why I'm leaving\*\* 

My fiancee lives in Philly, and my work only requires me be in person Tue-Thu. So I'm only in town for at max two nights a week. The apartment is great, but I was never there. So moving somewhere that's more a \*bed and nothing else\*

17ed6rg,DC lease signing from afar - doing my due diligence [DC],"Greetings,

I'm a single female in my mid-thirties, relocating to DC for work from overseas. I find myself on a rather tight timeline to secure housing (most likely a studio), within the monthly price range of $1600 to $2300. Despite dedicating over a hundred hours to research, I'm aware that cities like DC are constantly evolving, rendering some of the information I've gathered outdated.

With that in mind, I kindly seek your advice as a local. Could you please recommend 1 to 2 neighborhoods or sub-neighborhoods that I should consider? I am particularly interested in areas with a community feel, that offer close proximity and easy access to safe parks and nature trails, efficient public transit to downtown, and quality grocery stores.

While I don't particularly enjoy clubbing, bar hopping, or loud neighbors at night, I do appreciate being able to walk home (relatively) safely after dark and attend the occasional intimate music or cultural performance in my neighborhood.

I am open to nearby suburbs in Virginia and Maryland as well. Your insights would be immensely valuable, and I am genuinely appreciative of your time and guidance.",2023,10

**Details:** 

* Rent: $700/month (averaging the past 12 months of utility and internet cost comes out to an additional $110/month for a total all-in average cost of $810/month)

Additional info: 

I've rented in Alexandria for 5+ years and this is one of the best finds out there in my cumulative experience--significantly under present rates today (which run close to $1,000 shared, or $1,700 for a studio), well-maintained, courteous roommates, nestled in a quiet Del Ray neighborhood and very safe at all hours of the day/night. Landlord is great and very responsive/flexible too and he and his family live right down the same street! 

About your roommates: 

Names are Rick and William. I’ve lived with the same roommates for 2+ years and they are solid guys; we all got along very well with each other. I have been living with them for over two years and enjoyed their company--even during COVID! We were all fairly on the quieter side. Both were very trustworthy, responsible, and respectable when it came to living together. They were certainly very solid roommates during a period where we all needed to work together to stay safe from COVID. 

**IF INTERESTED:**

qty2ur,$700 / 1br - Unbeatable $700/month (1 bd/shared bath) in shared 3 bd/2 bth townhome,"&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Amazing access, very safe, and walking distance (<15 min. away) to Braddock/King St. metro (blue/yellow), groceries, commuter bike trail, and historic Old Town. On-site parking.  


This is a 3-bedroom 2 bath townhome shared with two roommates-- Rick and William!  


Looking for someone who can take tenancy starting January 9th or sometime soon thereafter.  


**Details:**  


**Rent:** $700/month (averaging the past 12 months of utility and internet cost comes out to an additional $110/month for a total all-in average cost of $810/month)  


Room is unfurnished, but let me know what you’re looking for and I might be able to let go of some things for free or for a nominal cost  


**Security Deposit:** $700 (pet-friendly with an additional $150 security deposit)  


**Room details:** two-windowed corner-room; very well lit; room is \~150 sq ft room, shared bathroom, additional arts/hobby room next door and adjacent down the hall  


Central air conditioning and heating  


On-site parking in driveway  


Spacious backyard  


On-premise parking  


Shared kitchen appliances  


**Lease details:** 1 year lease, but if you need to leave early, Alan (the landlord) can sign a new lease with your replacement so you'd never need to worry with the stress of dealing with a subtenant or exit penalty.  


**Additional info:**  


I've rented in Alexandria for 5+ years and this is one of the best finds out there in my cumulative experience--significantly under present rates today (which run close to $1,000 shared, or $1,700 for a studio), well-maintained, courteous roommates, nestled in a quiet Del Ray neighborhood and very safe at all hours of the day/night. Landlord is great and very responsive/flexible too and he and his family live right down the same street!  


**About your roommates:**  


Names are Rick and William. I’ve lived with the same roommates for 2+ years and they are solid guys; we all got along very well with each other. I have been living with them for over two years and enjoyed their company--even during COVID! We were all fairly on the quieter side. Both were very trustworthy, responsible, and respectable when it came to living together. They were certainly very solid roommates during a period where we all needed to work together to stay safe from COVID.  


**IF INTERESTED:**

I will be moving to D.C. in July from the San Fransisco Bay Area. I have a 10 year old cat, her name is Meeka, who would be moving with me. 

&#x200B;

A little about me:   
I’m 22 year olds, queer, a massive history dork, and I am returning to D.C. for work. I love to cook and bake (but always clean up after myself) and would love to connect with my roommate(s) over a meal or baked good. I’m in the process of applying to law school, so that takes up most of my free time but I usually spend my down hours watching anime, listening to true crime podcasts, solving puzzles, and of course, trying new recipes. I’m pretty quiet and introverted but I don’t mind being social either, as hard as it is during the global pandemic. I am vaccinated and take wearing a mask outside very seriously. Ideally I would love to be friendly with my roommate(s) and have a positive and communication based relationship so we can all live together happily while having our needs and wants met.   
I am looking in the Dupont Circle, Logan Circle, Shaw, Capitol Hill/Eastern Market, and Columbia Heights areas!",2021,04

I'm trying to figure out what neighborhoods would be best for my budget/commute. I'd love to be able to walk to work, but it feels like Navy Yard/SW Waterfront will stretch my budget. I'd love for bars/restaurants to be walkable, but it's not a big deal--it's more important that the area is safe. I have a car, but depending on where I end up living it's likely I'll sell it. What neighborhoods should I be looking at? Anyone ever lived in one of those fancy luxury buildings with all the amenities and was it worth it?

njhob4,Two bedroom available right across key bridge!,"Hey Everyone! 

If anyone is looking to move closer to Georgetown, Rosslyn, Courthouse area my apartment is available for rent. It takes two minutes to drive to Georgetown and is about a 5 minute walk to Courthouse area. I walk my dog everyday up to Clarendon and that takes less than 15 minutes.

I know it says 1 parking spot but its actually 2 and a private parking lot included. If no parking in the lot is available (which it always is) you are given a pass to park on the street. The zoning extends all the way up into Clarendon and Ballston so you can park up there for free as well. My electric usually runs about 40 dollars a month. Since its only 9 units its a really safe community and everyone knows each other. Super friendly neighbors and never had a problem.I loved it but unfortunately my dog is too big now and needs more room!

My girlfriend and I are hopefully moving to D.C. post-graduation and thus far, we're not having much luck finding a place to live. She starts her job in Alexandria May 26th and would really like to be settled around May 18th.

I'll most likely be working around Dupont, but I also have a car while she has to take a metro so I'm willing to drive a bit further if necessary. But for us, price is the biggest deal-breaker.

She *really* wants to feel safe in her neighborhood, as well. She's also really big on in-room/building washer-dryer units and a dishwasher.

Bedrooms: 4Bathrooms: 2.5

Rent: $1050

Deposit: $1050

Utilities: Usually mostly covered by basement apartment credit (Average without is $85 a month)

Lease term: 1 year

Washer/Dryer: in house

Distance to metro: <5 minute walk.

Credit/Background Check: Required by Landlord ($35 fee)

3 rooms will be available on November 1st, 2019 in a 4 Bed 3 Bath row house just off Georgia Avenue. The house sits just a short 5 minute walk away from the Georgia Ave-Petworth Station. Safeway, CVS, and the great food options Georgia Avenue has to offer are all a short walk away. The neighborhood is very quiet, pleasant and safe.

The house is three floors. The top two floors both have two bedrooms and a bathroom with the bottom floor being a shared spaced containing the living room, kitchen, a small bathroom, and a small sun room. Both rooms on the second floor and one room on the third floor are available. The south facing second floor room comes with its own private sun room. The house is also PoC and LGBTQ+ friendly.

The house works on a group lease with each person paying 1/4th of the rent each month. Rent for the next lease will be 1050 each. The house has a (recently vacated but hopefully filled soon) separate basement apartment which shares a backyard with us. The city sends a credit for this apartment which usually covers most or all of the utilities for the month. 

I'm ideally looking for 3 other responsible young professionals who would be willing to sign a 1 year lease with me for the house. The landlord requires an application process which costs $35 to do a credit and background check. The first month's rent and the security deposit will be due on November 1st. Unfortunately due to the group lease the start date of the lease is not flexible.
