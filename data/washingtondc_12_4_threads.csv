1c85kwu,Just released from prison and I want to start a new life in DC…Will I make it?,"Hello.. so I recently moved to DC from NC after serving a 43 month sentence for non-violent crimes (released in March of 2024). These crimes were property related crimes in relation to an addiction to opiates that I struggled with for years.

During my incarceration a girl I dated in high school entered back into my life. This girl was living in DC and secured a good job after completing a graduate program at Georgetown. We quickly grew towards one another and she eventually asked me to move up to DC after getting out. To make a long story short, we got married during my incarceration so I could qualify for the “Interstate Compact” which gives me eligibility to transfer my parole from NC to DC. Obviously everything worked out and I’m here now living with her in a nice area of the city. 

Currently I’m attending an outpatient recovery program 4 days a week and I’m doing individual therapy once a week to help with my recovery. North Carolina prisons are extremely understaffed and funding is stretched so thin that I had almost no access to rehabilitation/recovery related programs while inside.

As of now I am solely working on myself and my wife is urging me to keep it this way as we are not hurting financially. However in the fall I am planning on attending Uni. of the District of Columbia and would like to get an idea of what my chances are of being able to grow into a contributing member of society. I am looking into studying either : Corrections Administrations (AAS),  Clinical Addiction Specialists (BS), also something I am very interested in is Aviation Maintenance Technology/Technician (AAS).

Obviously I have a lot of work to do and I’m hopeful for my future but I would like to know what are my chances here in DC? With being a felon and wanting to achieve these types of degrees and jobs will I face obstacles?

Also, any ideas for part-time work that may be applicable to someone like me?

I served 43 months, so by the time I will have acquired one of these degrees I will have nearly 60 months since the date of offense for my crimes which might help employers realize my mistakes were made several years ago and I have done quite a bit to become a changed man.

I’m not a bad person, I excelled in high school and went to  a private college in NC to study Pre-Med before receiving a tonsillectomy at the age of 20 and being prescribed opioids. This turned into an addiction which eventually lead to heroin/fentanyl use. I tried to live a normal life and fought addiction while trying to attend community college for a few years. I ended up in and out of county jail a few times and served two prison sentences (2018-2020 and 2020-2024). I was able to mature greatly during my last sentence having been sentenced to a considerably more amount of time than the previous 19 months I had served.

Today, I am free, sober, happy and happily married with an amazing support system. 

Any help would be appreciated, don’t hesitate to comment the reality of what I’m up against either. Thanks.",2024,04
1btzbaj,Harlow Navy Yard - Do Not Move There!,"Apologies for the long post - worth the read for anyone currently apartment searching in Navy Yard! I've been living in DC  for almost 6 years now and wanted to try a new neighborhood last summer, so I moved to Navy Yard. **The Harlow** had relatively affordable apartments and beautiful units in a pretty new building, so I signed a lease. Less than 4 months later, I had to fight the building management to break my lease because of a truly insane amount of violent and threatening incidents. **I want to warn anyone of this building - it is not worth your safety or sanity.** 

A brief list of things I experienced at Harlow: 

* A resident threw a large rock through the front door and shattered it, management did not notify residents and did not clean up the glass for weeks
* A resident set their own apartment on fire (DCFD twitter described them as a ""hostile occupant,"" while management claimed ""isolated incident"") and then shot out their window as FD was entering, putting entire building at risk. Was told this resident would be let back into the building, ""unless convicted of arson.""
* Next door neighbors had violent screaming matches from midnight - 5-6am regularly, walked around hallways half naked, smoked cigarettes that made my entire unit smell on a daily basis
* During one particularly alarming screaming fight, I called building ""security"" on my neighbors,  called the direct line 20+ times with zero response. Straight to voicemail
* The next day, management told me the security guard ""dropped his phone in the toilet."" 
* Building called police on neighbors, assured I wouldn't be involved, neighbor proceeded to corner me in hallway and threaten me if I ever tried to call cops on them again
* Shooting (10+ gunshots) occurred directly outside front entrance, building never notified residents as it was ""not resident related""
* Another shooting directly outside entrance, this time at 11pm on a Sunday, victim came into the building. Blood all over lobby, elevator, shell casings found in stairwell
* Management states they ""do not provide any security to residents, safety is a personal matter"" after advertising a security guard and direct line
* Two residents involved in bloody fight on bench outside front entrance, cops come, blood all over front sidewalk for days before cleaned
* Management claims they are hiring a night security guard - for 10 days after his ""start date"", no guard to be found. I sent timestamped pictures of the empty guard desk to management for days in a row, they tell me ""he was probably in the bathroom."" Every night? At random times? Sure.
* **This is the real kicker** \- on Sunday morning, a **homicide** shooting occurred inside the hallway of the 10th floor. Outside roof/club house common areas. Management is closed for holiday, takes 9 hours to notify residents, while there is blood in hallway and bullet holes in walls. And - get this - the police had to borrow fobs from residents to access elevators because the SECURITY LINE WENT STRAIGHT TO VOICEMAIL. The line they claimed was fixed after ""he dropped his phone in the toilet"" months ago.

**How can they advertise this as a luxury building?** 

Without starting discourse about Navy Yard/crime in general, I want to know if other people have had similar experiences. Is this building an anomaly? Is there any way to effectively hold management/ownership accountable? I tried the tenant advocacy office, my ANC rep, and submitted constant complaints to the corporate ownership company to no avail. I feel they are breaking some sort of law here by endangering tenants, and though I had the means to move out, I fear for the lives of those still living there.",2024,04

We didn’t exchange contact information because you were clearly in shock and our priority was just making sure you felt safe. 

We did want to let you know that we walked away and called 911. It was your call if you wanted to call the police and report this man (who I also got a visual of) but we wanted to make sure there was at least record of someone else calling with a description of him. 

It is not too late to make a report. Your report may help pinpoint a suspect if he has ever done this to anyone else or if he does this in the future.

For everyone else in the Petworth area:

Black male, 20’s, I’d say 5’8”-ish (or perhaps a little shorter), slightly longer hair (it looked like short twists, but he was running away from us as soon as he knew he was caught and it was nighttime so it was hard to remember), and a metallic silver puffer jacket.

Scroll on if you'd rather answer the latest newcomer post about how it's hard to find romantic partners or activity friends in This Town.

Bike lane fights matter because they are analogous to fights you may more directly care about: [building more housing](https://ggwash.org/view/72150/heres-what-happens-when-you-try-to-build-150-apartments-in-dupont) in places you actually want to live, [building homeless shelters](https://dcist.com/story/23/08/08/dc-homeless-shelter-gw-dorm/) with wraparound services where houseless residents already have a support network ([diff link on that](https://www.dcurbanmom.com/jforum/posts/list/180/557686.page)\*), and [permitting daycare](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/excessive-child-care-regulations-dc-drive-up-costs-nick-ottens/) services in neighborhoods you already live with staff who can [actually afford](https://www.wusa9.com/article/entertainment/television/programs/get-up-dc/childcare-sector-collapse-in-the-district-if-we-dont-fix-this-dc-councilmember-christina-henderson-on-proposed-budget-cuts/65-bb719afe-0f5d-4640-9ec5-c326770a7490) to themselves pay for daycare (capitalism is fun). You probably wouldn't need much yarn to map out the NIMBY nexus of Wards 2 and 3, Always Sunny-style. I won't dignify them by naming them here, but inquiring minds would start on the losing end of recent ANC elections.

If you haven't already, I hope you read my previous [post explaining](https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/1c1xrmz/getting_involved_on_connecticut_avenue/) the conflict of Connecticut Avenue NW without diverging too far into technical specs, media theory, or sociology. Max Weber [would've loved](https://www.slowboring.com/p/welcome-to-slow-boring) Civic Association shouting matches. The fight on CT Ave NW is important because it's a microcosm of local politics, and my primary goal as a resident is getting more people involved in local D.C. civics in whatever issue they're passionate about. Journalist [Andrew Callaghan is correct](https://youtu.be/yEou104m_P0?si=AaXRFYs7I19BrvWe&t=7870) that local issues matter more and you can actually change stuff at street level.

Re-designing streets to add bike lanes is a [cheap](https://www.quora.com/How-expensive-is-it-for-cities-to-create-bike-lanes), [proven](https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/verify/verify-protected-bicycle-lanes/65-ec579ea3-8e4e-4f30-bb55-c65db77153c2), [equitable](https://www.minnpost.com/community-voices/2022/07/regarding-summit-avenue-bike-lanes-data-show-that-favoring-cars-over-bikes-is-inequitable/) design intervention to make all road users behave safer. The current DDOT Director misses the plot by [asserting](https://www.washingtonian.com/2024/04/15/dc-cyclists-arent-giving-up-on-connecticut-ave-bike-lanes/) that a bike lane project is not also a safety project. In practice, roads get safer primarily by taking space currently reserved for car movement and storage and giving that space to other uses. That's because motor vehicles are very dangerous machines; [pretty much](https://safety.fhwa.dot.gov/zerodeaths/docs/FHWA-SA-20-073_Lessons_Learned_from_Development_of_Vision_Zero_Action_Plans.pdf) the only effective way we've found to make their pilots behave more safely is to reverse the generations-long mistake of widening lanes, making them more numerous, and [bulldozing neighborhoods](https://www.ce.washington.edu/files/pdfs/about/Highway-to-inequity.pdf) for their expansion. If you give motorists ""more margin for error,"" [they respond](https://narrowlanes.americanhealth.jhu.edu/) with increased recklessness. The [red transit lanes](https://buspriority.ddot.dc.gov/) and the (sometimes) green -- not often enough physically protected -- bike lanes are favored uses for that dangerous, extra space. The other effective intervention for safer streets is Enforcement -- a [deeply flawed](https://arrestedmobility.com/) choice with at least as long generational harm.

It may seem like there was an organized plot to add bike lanes serving D.C. transplants who're gentrifying your old haunts. In fact, [more](https://www.npr.org/2023/06/26/1184034017/us-pedestrian-deaths-high-traffic-car) pedestrians and bicyclists have died on American streets than ever before in recent years. It's only in the last three decades that transportation departments have decided to (sometimes) give shit about that. And really it's only municipal DOTs that have done things. And many other relevant variables have gotten worse, like [bigger, heavier](https://www.npr.org/2023/11/14/1212737005/cars-trucks-pedestrian-deaths-increase-crash-data) cars on average -- with [worse visibility](https://youtu.be/f6k0-3QrZjA?si=WeDRidb22I1ROKe2) even though you ""sit high"" in the driver's seat.

Streets are public space, and [insanely high percentages](https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2019/11/27/parking-dominates-our-cities-but-do-we-really-see-it) of that space is currently preventing progress on codified community goals. Protected bike lanes and honest-to-god, enforced transit lanes make it safer and more practical to use non-car modes for essential travel ([moveDC](https://movedc.dc.gov/) master plan) with a propellant that is either electric or lower carbon per road user ([SustainableDC](https://sustainable.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/sustainable/page_content/attachments/SDC_CEDC_CRDC_ProgressReport_2023_Final.pdf) master plan).  We help businesses in urban contexts by doing [almost literally anything else](https://www.businessinsider.com/bike-lanes-good-for-business-studies-better-streets-2024-3) with curbside space other than infrequent turnover parking.

As it happens, the people who fight the housing are often the same handful of people who fight [against bus lanes](https://wjla.com/news/local/sixteenth-street-nw-bus-project-residents-parking)\*\*, yell on 17th Street NW about those bike lanes, and [try to stop](https://www.ward3housingjustice.org/post/op-urged-to-analyze-wardmantied-to-green-new-deal) neighborhood-embedded affordable housing. The vocal minority on pretty much every positive change you want for your community is held up by the same few who actually show up. And the people with real power, like business improvement districts and [politicians with shiftable positions](https://commercialobserver.com/2023/04/dc-considers-changes-to-planned-downtown-bike-lanes-after-cre-protests/), avoid real accountability to the residents they serve when the usual suspect pro-change advocates go against the usual suspect anti-change advocates. Often, when something goes viral, politicians deputize the trends and buy themselves more cover. That's exactly how [#DontMuteDC](https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/go-go-becomes-official-music-of-dc/2220108/)\*\*\* happened and [BLM Plaza on 16th St NW](https://morefire.substack.com/p/theyre-trying-to-hijack-the-movement) by the White House.

Public debates about bike lanes are [""captured""](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014292123001629) by media and politicians into stereotypes about cyclists as a tiny special interest group (and not literally anyone who rents a Capital Bikeshare or loves someone who does) because American culture does not see bikes as affordable, accessible, capable transportation tools. Frankly, much of the ""bike lobby"" plays into America's demotion of ""bike stuff"" as only a recreational nice-to-have to grab the scraps of road fuding. It is disappointing but unsurprising that [our hometown glossy](https://www.washingtonian.com/2024/04/15/dc-cyclists-arent-giving-up-on-connecticut-ave-bike-lanes/) tees up the next steps regarding Connecticut Avenue by framing that bike lanes only serve a small interest group called ""cyclists."" Few would write the headline ""walkers committed to sidewalk improvements,""\*\*\*\* and the news rarely says ""drivers committed to highway interchange modernization."" Only in American journalism would small, poorly funded groups of residents begging not to be run over on the road be framed as a special interest group. As if [Jim Pagels](https://wjla.com/news/local/he-was-only-29-dc-cycling-enthusiast-struck-and-killed-by-a-car-while-biking-in-nw) and [America Walks](https://americawalks.org/) could have ever been in the same stratosphere as [Brandon Todd](https://twitter.com/AlexKomaWCP/status/1779590447209263451) and [AAA Mid-Atlantic](https://ggwash.org/view/6553/aaa-more-cycle-friendly-except-where-money-is-concerned).

**If your group chat hasn't banished you yet,** one last bit of context: changing the composition of streets to make it safer and more inviting to bike or walk -- and to prioritize transit over private cars -- is part of a long but important fight to retake America's transportation networks for [cleaner, greener, safer, smarter](https://www.transportevolved.com/) options. This is sometimes called ""The War on Cars,"" a ridiculous [moniker we wear proudly](https://thewaroncars.org/). The short, disconnected bike lane proposed near your house, school, office, church, or daycare can and should be the beginning of a connected network where your family's second car gets sold in favor of an electric cargo bike. Or just that [your family can take transit](https://ggwash.org/view/87902/transit-diary-family-life-by-bike-with-the-mcentees) instead. It is [incorrect](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/may/05/amsterdam-bicycle-capital-world-transport-cycling-kindermoord) to say that ""Amsterdam was always like that"" and the politics rarely allows for the incremental change folks like me fight for. Connecticut Avenue NW is a big deal because it's a cornerstone of that shift here in the District.

In addition to The Wire, I recommend the TV Show ""[Show my a Hero""](https://youtu.be/PwqHZH1Uqvo?si=fm9n-rFZuJno368D) and the movie ""[Trial of the Chicago 7](https://youtu.be/FVb6EdKDBfU?si=-RVuXjUPjQyCiw-c)"" as entertaining entry points into local politics in the former's case and good arguments about changing the world in the latter.

ahdaid,Think it may be time to move out of NW DC due to crime (6 years U-street Corridor),"What has been going on the last 6 months in NW DC. The crime rate in Columbia Heights, U Street and other close by neighborhoods has skyrocketed.

&#x200B;

Just yesterday a 70 year old women dog walker was almost beaten to death with pipes (see link below) at 1pm. 24 hours earlier, a women was robbed at knife point and had her leg broken (see link below that). Add to that all the gun violence in Columbia Heights and some sections on U Street.

&#x200B;

My brother, who lives by Howard U was almost in a robbery at a liquor store after work. The cops were called. He has been living here for a while also and has never seen it this bad.

&#x200B;

With a pregnant wife, it maybe time to go. It was never like this in the 6+ years I have lived here. What is causing it? We have many close friends within a 10 block radius and they can confirm the spike in crime in this area.

1f1plcp,DC or “Second City”,"Edit:

My partner and I live in Capitol Hill, DC. We love the neighborhood and the walkability.

We’re getting to the point though, where things like a real backyard, garage, and dedicated office are becoming more of a priority.

But we both agree that we either live in DC and reap the benefits of the walkability, public transport, etc - or we are going to live in a “second city” elsewhere (Cincinnati, Louisville, Grand Rapids, etc.) 

When we tell our friends that our next move will probably be out of the city and Nova area they are in utter SHOCK that we would rather go to the Midwest instead of Arlington, Bethesda, etc. 

Nothing about the suburban life outside of DC seems appealing… mainly because of the complete reliance on cars and the endless traffic and the prices for homes are getting higher than in Washington DC.

I’m wondering if anybody else feels this way? That you’re either in the thick of the city or completely out of the greater area.",2024,08
19d5gwm,Melting is not an effective snow policy,"UPDATE, 1/24: The WABA Trail Rangers (maybe also NoMA BID) appear to have salted and ice-broke a lot yesterday, and the Eckington MBT segment is clear. By the end of today, temps will be in the 50s, and hopefully, the worst sidewalks around D.C. will get melting. It is important to note here that the trail rangers are government grant-funded shepherds of trail maintenance, and BIDs collect tax revenue from government-determined business districts. Some commenters say D.C. doesn't get snow or deep cold frequently enough to budget money for its removal. As climate change gets worse, D.C. will get more extreme storms more frequently (i.e. more random heavy snow and deep cold AND more extended 90-degree days). We can and should use government to become more resilient to these hazards and not leave behind our most vulnerable travelers (people walking and biking, on sidewalks and trails).

\*\*\*\*

I've been frustrated with the D.C. government's lackluster snow readiness on and near trails and sidewalks in the past week. Pre-storm salt treatments and snow clearing seem to have been done well within roads for the Monday, 1/15, and Friday, 1/19 storms. But the places for people walking and biking appear to have been treated less urgently by the government. Our major non-car travel corridors were at the mercy of adjacent property owners/managers.

Relying on melt from mid-day sunlight and a days-later warm front is short of the excellence residents deserve from the government. Sidewalks and trails are essential transportation routes. Our government should deploy proactive pre-treatment with dog- and water-friendly melting mixes and follow-up with quick snow removal using vehicles the correct size for the job (i.e. trucks for between the curb and narrow vehicles/snow blowers for sidewalks and trails). You just need planning, resources, and execution for what is a basic public service.

It's unacceptable for people to see if they can safely get to work by posting on social media, asking for ""trail conditions"" or ""sidewalk reports."" I'm very happy the DMV is moving toward constructing many trails within the big Capital Trails Coalition network, where millions of people could use a cargo e-bike as a second car for their family. But if all three jurisdictions don't treat trails like their main roads for cars, then that future is impossible. See the links below for NPS and other government agencies dropping the ball.

I live next to the Metropolitan Branch Trail, which was neglected in the segments near Fort Totten, Brookland CUA, and the Rhode Island Avenue Metro walk/bike bridge. It wasn't great South of Tanner Park either, though NoMA BID did some M Street NE ramp clearing. My Friends of the MBT group couldn't get out to clear the snow until Saturday morning -- at which point it was mostly ice. We cleared the Bryant Street Dog Park entryway and a few hours of minimally effective icebreaking where sunlight doesn't easily melt with salt that the government eventually dropped.

D.C. needs to get serious so this is never repeated on what will soon be an 8-mile MBT from Union Station up to Silver Spring (trail currently 4.8 miles). D.C. is getting better at this with the protected bike lanes, but last week's reaction won't cut it when much of the newer trail segments are on NPS land.  NPS let DDOT build the MBT segment on Fort Totten, but they still haven't knocked out a maintenance agreement. The MBT Eckington segment is currently a mess of ice and slick, packed-down snow. On the RIA bridge, WMATA, DDOT, and DPW argued over whose job it is to clear the pedestrian bridge. Nothing happened until the neighborhood commissioners complained enough. Government-by-complaint like this is fatally flawed.

If you've read this far and have a stake in the MBT, please consider signing up to volunteer with FoMBT - [https://forms.gle/ehr79phaTQndgvcAA](https://forms.gle/ehr79phaTQndgvcAA). We do drinking water stations and trail cleanups during the warm weather months, and apparently snow or ice clearing in the winter, and organize to get trail improvements all year round with local government advocacy. The commitment is as little as 1 hour on one day every 2 weeks to re-fill and clean drinking water stations, April through October. We hope also to set up tables at farmers markets to recruit members.

* As of 1/24, large portions of the Prince George's County trail network were still unsafe because NPS doesn't drop salt or clear trails, and the many different localities have varying capabilities for that. I reiterate my point that we cannot, as a region, claim that trails are feasible routes for essential transportation unless we treat them as essential from an operations and maintenance standpoint. You can't get people on e-cargo bikes with tax credits, convince them to sell their second family car, and then cry understaffing when they dump the kids onto the ground from an icy patch that DPW&T overlooks.

3din45,Update to Bozzuto’s Response to Increased NoMa Crime,"I just received a call back from a regional manager at Bozzuto in response to an email I sent yesterday to the president of Bozzuto Management, their PR person, and their Development President, and I had copied the Wards 5 and 6 Councilmembers.  Below is a summary of what was expressed to me, and I’ll try to leave my editorial comments out. 

The manager began the call by thanking me for reaching out.  She said Bozzuto appreciated when residents expressed their concerns to management, rather than leaving the properties without first trying to get their issues resolved (I think this is kind of common sense). 

She went on to say that of course Bozzuto is aware (and concerned with) the numerous issues in NoMa lately.  She stressed that they were working on a memo that should be sent out today, and that the company wanted to be sure they had all of their information correct, they were communicating in the best way possible, and they were giving us all of the information that they were allowed to give.  The manager emphasized (bordering on apology, it seemed) that she wasn’t making excuses for the length of time it took to draft this memo and communicate to their residents, but that Bozzuto wanted to make sure they had some answers and action items.  

She explained to me that Bozzuto does not own the NoMa properties but instead manages them for an owner.  Bozzuto has reached out to companies for cost and proposals for the following improvements, as well as approval from the owners for costs:

* Elevator key card access 
* Installing a courtesy guard on the rooftop/pool decks to manage crowd control

There will also be a new ID check policy they will be enforcing and will be sending the details out in this afternoon’s memo.

She addressed the suggestions I had put in my original email and apologized for the lack of communication.  I went on to suggest that, rather than receiving a cold and removed memo from corporate, Bozzuto holds some meetings in each or most of their NoMa buildings and conveys this information personally to its residents.  I’m not sure where that will lead.

Finally, though Bozzuto was not represented at the Flats meeting posted earlier on this sub, they did attend last night’s Lobby Project meeting, a NoMa BID security meeting, and another community event (apologies for not catching it) in light of these events. 

We ended the call, and she provided me with her email in case I had any follow up, and she thanked me again for reaching out.  I told her to feel free to contact me again in case Bozzuto wants “ears on the ground” feedback. 

If anyone has any questions, I’ll do my best to answer them here.  Fellow Bozzuto residents, you should expect to see an email with the official memo from Bozzuto later this afternoon.

Thanks, all. 

TL;DR: Send yer emails.  Memo taking forever.  Action items claimed to be in process.

* Yesterday around 7pm my gf and I witnessed a homeless man chase after a girl with his dick FULLY out. This was right in plain sight on M st while the oyster bar patio was packed. She had to run into the Streets Market so that the security guard could help.
* 2. This morning, I'm walking in front of Seoulspice and a worker runs out on the phone saying he needs cops there now and a homeless man was trying to get forced out of the Seoulspice by other employees. (while this was happening, dick dude from last night was casually strolling by. just a bonus)
* 3. Last week I had a shiv pulled on me while smoking a cigarette around 11pm (outside RESA / King st oyster bar). When I tried to get back inside, he cornered me but the oyster bar employees came outside to clean up the patio so he left when he saw them.

**I realize we live in a heavily gentrified area and this stuff will happen.** What's concerning is that it's happening way more often than it used to.

The city just did some attempt to kick out the homeless community under the bridge by REI, and it seems like that is what sparked the aggression.

To me it seems like I can’t afford to live in a 700+ sqft and clean apartment in literally anywhere else. I’ve lived in historic buildings before in NYC and it’s not clean or comfortable. I just want a comfy and quiet apartment to relax in. 

I get that it’s not historic and doesn’t have a lot of character. BUT I work from home and don’t drink a lot, and I don’t want to live around crazy partying. 

Am I missing something? Here’s my criteria: 

-under $2,900 for 1 bed + den
-near trails/parks
-near good takeout restaurants 
-quiet and relatively safe neighborhood 
-clean 
-central AC preferred 
-apartment building with controlled access for safety (I’m a woman) 

I’ve found quite a few buildings in navy yard that fit the bill. I visited this past weekend and the crowds did not seem “libertarian” to me. Also I’ll mention that I won’t be living near the ballpark. I’ll be living near 1Hundred and Illume.

I feel like it serves its purpose as affordable high density housing. Like I keep hearing to live in DuPont but it doesn’t seem like it’s even affordable there?

and were yelled at and threatened by a 5’6” black man in black pants, red shoes and a beige reebok sweatshirt

he was saying things like
“ching chong ni hao” and “im going to push you into the train” and “im going to follow you” as we walked away

he got off the train as well as us. he started to yell “did anybody hear her say fuck” and such
we continued to walk away with two women for help and went up the platform escalator (thank you to the two women who walked with us after we got off the train! i hope you both can see this we’re very thankful)

we started to run up the escalator leading outside as we heard him yelling and coming closer after we went thru the metro payment gate

we hid in the nearby macys afterwards 

if anybody was around and witnessed what happened please dm me 

thank you!

Edit: some additional clarifying details after some time to collect ourselves!

- happened between 12:58pm - 01:10pm
- between dupont circle -> metro center, he got on at farrugut north and the incident happened right after that on the train and then off the train as he followed us
- he had his hood up so we arent sure if he has long hair but he was of a thin build (not very skinny but a little smaller than average) about our height (5’5”/5’4”) so likely 5’6”
- blue thin layer of material that went around his head like an inner hoodie under his reebok hoodie (likely a balaclava mask)
- most likely 22 (as stated by the guy), young 20s

1fpo3o7,Just Moved Here and Already Facing Harassment as a Woman,"I've been here for three weeks. Last week, while walking in Mt. Pleasant at 9 in the morning, I was behind a man who abruptly stopped, turned around, and tried to jab me with a fork. I veered around him and started walking faster, assuming he might have been paranoid (since he was obviously not in a normal mental state) that I was following him. I looked behind me, and he was speeding up and chasing me.

I ended up approaching a middle aged man outside a complex to stand next to him, realizing that the fork man was still coming after me. I quietly said that the fork man was following me and apologized for standing so close, then proceeded to loop around the man while the guy with the fork was looping and chasing me. The other guy didn’t even acknowledge what I said or attempt to help me. Finally, the crazy fork guy let out an angry noise and chucked the fork at a car before leaving.

Now, just today, I had a second incident. I was walking on a main street in Adams Morgan, being aware as usual and walking confidently. Suddenly, a man came out of nowhere with his arms wide open and mouth agape, walking directly towards me and pushing against me to the point where I couldn't go anywhere because he was forcing me into the main street. I wasn't prepared for this, especially since it was broad daylight and so unexpected. I held the guy back with my arm and said, ""Get off of me,"" in a small tone. He continued to push me until I yelled, ""Get the fuck off of me!"" really loud. It was terrifying, especially in broad daylight.

I've been here for about three weeks, and the harassment has been overwhelming. I take every precaution: I carry pepper spray, walk confidently, stay aware of my surroundings, and avoid using my phone. I make sure not to engage with anyone who seems unstable, but it’s exhausting to constantly be on high alert. I’m not sure about the procedures for reporting incidents to the police without feeling like I'm overreacting. I’d love to hear if anyone has advice or similar stories about encounters like this. Am I doing everything right? I moved near Adams Morgan because it felt safe, but I realize that being in a city means I have to be aware that anything could happen at any time.

Update: Thank you all for the advice and kind words—I truly appreciate it :) I'm feeling more frustrated than scared. It's infuriating that people can get away with this kind of behavior toward me for no reason, and I feel powerless to do anything about it—there's only so much I can do. I’m a 5'2"" petite woman! I’m not sharing this for sympathy; I want to connect with others who have faced similar situations and gather HELPFUL advice. I’d like to think someone would step in if I were being attacked, even though they don’t owe me anything. In bigger cities, I’ve had men confront those who harassed me, but here in D.C., it feels like survival of the fittest. Guess it's time to win the lottery and hire bodyguards.",2024,09
pteigg,This sub seems to be astro-turfed frequently by far-right groups,"Mods are welcome to delete this if you think this post is too speculative. To avoid the appearance of brigading anyone individual user I will not name some of the users I have been researching who post exclusively on crime related posts here.

In short, I have been tracking a number of posts surrounding crime and politics in this sub-reddit. Each post seems to attract very far-right wing opinions. If you want evidence, look no further than a recent thread about the terrible shootings that happened recently. Though I think crime has become a more pressing issue in the city, many of the posts have a very similar tone to dog whistling.

I have been going through various histories of the users who are making these posts and I have found a few common threads:

1. Posts on other far-right sub-reddits.
2. Comments on niche sub-reddit with personal insults and trolling comments.
3. Posting on OTHER city sub-reddits with similar comments shown here.

For me, this raises a few red flags. Right now the evidence suggests most of these users and posts can be found in certain threads on certain topics.

If I had no experience in the DMV area and I came onto this sub-reddit and saw these comments, I would guess DC is a crime-infested warzone. Which is of course not true, just a city that suffers from the same problems since I have lived here, with variation of severity depending on the time period.

The rhetoric by far-right organizations leading up to the 2020 election really leaned into crime as an anti-democratic talking-point, painting ""democratic-run cities"" as hell-holes ran by incompetent politicians.

I see a similar pattern perhaps still playing out.

Take this for what you will. I'll end this by saying DC, like any other city, has its own problems, crime included. I hope we can work together to fix them. But this forum has really not become a reflection of the majority of people I have lived, worked, and made friends with here.",2021,09
s8cihs,Living in DC is much better than I expected,"I moved here from Atlanta for work in July 2021 (NIH) and DC has exceeded my expectations in every regard. My hometown is Cincinnati, Ohio for reference, and I have only lived in Philadelphia and Atlanta aside from DC. I guess my expectations were not complicated - quality housing, strong research institutions (for work), a good commute, hospitality, reasonable cost of living, especially housing, and nice parks/neighborhoods/landscapes. 

I must admit some personal events left me a negative view of Atlanta. In Atlanta I lived in an apartment that caught fire due to failing building codes (electrical problems), suffered and witnessed repeated car break-ins in the supposedly safe neighborhood I lived in, and experienced the fun of Atlanta traffic. I can't put down the parks, trees, history, diversity, cultural life, or jobs present there though. Just my experience was bad for aforementioned reasons, and apparently apartment fires plus crime were much more common than expected.

My apartment in Bethesda is shockingly inexpensive ($1240/mo for 1bd 1ba with utilities except electricity and internet) and well-maintained. It's a 1940s brick apartment complex that's OK on the outside and super nice on the inside. Excellent heat and air conditioning, new appliances, and a clean bathroom. Shockingly Atlanta rents are approaching DC levels, but CoVID seems to have had opposite effects on rent in each city. Anyway, this was a giant improvement on $1060/mo with no utilities, damaged appliances, and fires in Atlanta.

Commuting is good because the Metro and adjoining services can do what MARTA never could. Also probably I never experienced the Beltway pre-CoVID, so traffic has never felt bad. Drivers are probably a tad worse than Atlanta lol.

But hospitality wise, I was shocked at how friendly people are here not just near Bethesda. Compared with Atlanta, people here seem much more down to earth and trust each other. I think this has to do with people in DC walking vs. people in Atlanta driving, but more on that later. Bikes in my complex do not get stolen *while unlocked* and tenants and I have helped each other with bike repairs and such. Idk, Georgia and Florida definitely don't have Southern hospitality, but coming from the Midwest I always felt that to be really fake (sorry, don't mean offense, just my experience).

Probably the biggest improvement, though, is transportation and how I experience neighborhoods. I walk and bike so much here and feel much better physically/mentally compared with being stuck in traffic in Atlanta. Moving here made me bike 500 miles in 6 months lol. I've discovered not just Bethesda, Georgetown, Rockville, Silver Spring, and Tenleytown, but also SW Waterfront, Navy Yard, Capitol Hill, Mt. Pleasant, Mayfair/Deanwood, Kingman Park, Bladensburg, Hyattsville, College Park, and Takoma Park. Maybe being on a bike made a difference but people were so welcoming and courteous in all those neighborhoods. Again I wonder if people being pedestrians more often leads to more positive social interactions.

Is it just me or is DC better than people think in the more affordable pockets? The only two bad things I find are high house prices (and general affordable housing problems) and bad drivers (lol duh, almost every big city has those). Surely there's more, but probably not very different issues from any other city.

Also, Marion Barry as you all know is much more interesting than the one sad story us outsiders hear of him. Cool to learn his summer jobs program was made federal.

1f2viug,I think U Street area is still one of the coolest places to live in DC despite its problems ,"Despite the recent wave of crime, I still love living in this area. Nowhere else in the city gives you such a big city feel, yet it’s still surrounded by beautiful NW DC brownstones - walking between the two feels like teleporting into a different world. 

Not to mention all the history, many different types of folks from different backgrounds live there, it’s close to both the Capitol area and the nice areas of NW, I could go on. Like you can get to every different vibe in DC on foot. 

I also don’t feel that unsafe as an adult male, although the robberies are worrying. However, my only question is, why no police presence there? Mayor Adams for all his flaws has got cops on every inch of Manhattan it seems like and it really does help. Why can’t DC get more police presence in its busiest business district? I have a bit of empathy because they make like 50k, but it seems like they barely even get out of their patrol cars.

8t46ru,Cleveland Park vs. Mt. Pleasant/Columbia Heights. Concerned about safety.,"I know everyone on this sub scoffs at the idea of feeling unsafe in certain DC neighborhoods, including Columbia Heights, but I am a young woman who has never lived in a city before.

My boyfriend and I are deciding between an apartment in Cleveland Park (safe, but less action) and a place on Park Rd. (in Mt. Pleasant, but a 7 min. walk to Columbia Heights metro). We did a trial walk from the potential place to the CH metro at around 5 pm yesterday and encountered 3 kind of sketchy people either yelling at us or talking to themselves. I am concerned walking this route every day, especially at night.

People who live in Cleveland Park, do you find there's enough to do in the area? People (especially women) who live in Mt. Pleasant/Columbia Heights, do you feel safe walking around every day?

Thank you in advance for your help with such an important decision. We are really struggling. 

EDIT: I didn't feel unsafe in Mt. Pleasant, just a little uncomfortable. I'd love to hear from people who live in Mt. Pleasant who can tell me whether or not they've had any safety issues. 

EDIT 2: Thank you for all the comments. After reading them all and discussing and doing our own research, we decided to apply for the Cleveland Park place. We will obviously still visit other areas to experience more happening places in the city. ",2018,06
o930zn,Predatory behavior,"While walking around Logan Circle the other day, a man randomly approached me, made small talk, and asked about being friends since he’s new to town. I’m a bit embarrassed to admit that I fell for it and agreed to meet up with him for a walk later in the day. Less than 5 minutes after meeting up with him, he made up excuses to touch me in a way that was controlling/uncomfortable (e.g., insisted on “helping me” cross the street by grabbing my arm without consent) and made vile sexual comments to me. I got away safely, have his legal name and phone number, and learned afterwards that he basically did the same thing to my friend. 

If nothing else, I feel obligated to give y’all a heads up to stay safe out there since such behavior—while violating— isn’t criminalized.

Unfortunately, due to COVID 19 my job in live events has ended and my family and I have no other choice but to move. It was a pleasure living in the district!

Now onto the current apartment pricing in DC. Specifically speaking in NoMa. My apartment base rent was $2092 (1br) and was recently listed for $1590. The apartment a block away is offering two months free. Half of the people in my apartment have moved out. It’s a complete ghost town on my floor. 

There are 5 current apartment buildings being built in a 0.5 mile radius scheduled for completion within 1 year. Three apartment complexes were completed late 2020 early 2021. These apartments also have specials and reduced rent.

I’ve examined the area specifically in NE and it looks like most apartments are down $400 a month on average with lots of incentives. If you’re looking to move to NE DC it is a renters market right now and they are panicking for new tenants.

1gvokxm,Buying your first home in DC ,"My husband and I just started renting a townhouse in a cool part of town that's right on the edge of gentrification, making it affordable despite it's size and tolerable in terms of safety (just can't be an idiot).

However, now that we have fully settled in and decorated etc at the 9 month mark in our 12 month lease, we have just gotten word that our landlord might put the house up for sale.

I'm a bit exhausted by renting at this point, so my husband and I were considering buying it when it came up for sale. This would be our first home, and while we make decent salaries for the area, some recent medical expenses, job lulls, and our recent wedding have dug into our savings a bit. I'm thus considering whether an FHA loan might be the way to go, or if there are other long-term costs with that that I'm unaware of. 

Another key consideration in this entire exchange is the fact that the house includes a basement apartment that will be sold with it. We like our basement apartment neighbor very much and would love to just keep her on (also so she wouldn't have to move--she also wants to stay). But as first time homebuyers, I'm sure you can understand that we have also never been landlords, which brings up a whole other set of questions. 

I guess my general asks fall in two main categories. As DC residents, what should we consider when buying our first home here? Are there assistance programs, grants, credits, etc that I should look into?

The boy then repeated the words ""you dirty Chinese"" and said something that I again could not hear, partly due to the podcast playing in my ear. I yanked my dog and continued walking and thankfully there were no further interactions but I am genuinely disturbed by what happened and not sure what anyone should have done in this case.

I actually carry pepper spray in my treat bag (ever since that dog got stolen in broad daylight in front of the CVS on 8th), but my brain was not processing fast enough to remember that.

I'm going to be studying at GWU starting mid August. I live in Spain so I am very clueless about life in DC in general. I was wondering how safe it is to walk from the University to the Dupont Circle area at around 9pm, which is when my classes finish. I've been looking at apartments for the past few days and the pricing there is relatively low compared to other areas, and the area is close enough for me to walk! 

Are there people in the street at this time of the day? Or are the streets empty and therefore unsafe for walking alone? 


And another question I have for you is: 

How easy is it to rent a room on AirBnB? 

I'm going to be living with a friend on a 2Bed apartment, but he is going to stay few days at home due to work (he has to travel regularly), so we thought about renting his room while he is away and earning some money to pay for our own rent. Ideally we would make enough money to compensate not getting a 1Bed apartment and having one of us sleep on the living room. Do you think this is feasible? Is the demand big enough?

In February 2024 they voted 5-1-1 to have DDOT move safety fixes forward. Cmmsr Kirby (4C02) voted NO and Cmmsr Swegman (4C01) abstained -- neither represent Grant Circle itself. On Wednesday, July 10, all seven voted in favor of Alternative 1. There are three commissioners with districts around Grant Circle: Kademian, Livingston, and Heller. All three have been strong supporters of safety improvements.

This is nearly the same situation as 2016-17 when many of these same residents and Mayor Bowser's senior advisor Beverley Perry killed Grant Circle's more robust safety vision back then.

o374jc,[LONG RANT] Stupid dangerous ATVs/dirt bikes on U Street,"Please delete if not allowed.

I've lived in the U Street/14th street neighborhood for 5 years. I know this isn't a new problem, I know there are laws preventing police from doing literally anything.

But now that people think the pandemic is over, the level of dangerous ATV/dirt bike activity has increased dramatically. In only 2 hours on U Street tonight, I witnessed dozens if not ***over a hundred*** illegal ATVs and dirt bikes speeding up and down U Street. At least 70% of them purposefully stopped in the MIDDLE of the 12th & U intersection (they don't care if it's a green, yellow or red light or if pedestrians or cars are in the middle of the street) to pop wheelies over and over, completely obstructing traffic and endangering lives.

I witnessed car after car screeching to a stop abruptly in the middle of the intersection, when they had the right of way, because 6-10 dirt bikes in a row sped through the red light (this happened almost every 5 mins). I witnessed regular bicyclists fall over and stumble off their bikes to avoid getting run over. 

I witnessed DOZENS of pedestrians crossing the street having to pull their friends, family, and kids out of the way because of this shit. I witnessed young children and girls on the backs of these ATVs, with no helmets, who could have easily fallen off or been hurt in other ways. I witnessed an ATV pulling a regular bike behind it and a kid was LITERALLY STANDING with his feet on his bike seat and handlebars through a red light.

U Street on any given weekend is the busiest street in all of DC, and yet there is NOTHING that DC police or lawmakers are doing to prevent this from happening.

Around 9:30pm a police cruiser finally pulled up to the corner. They parked their car and 3 officers got out. They hung out on the corner of the intersection, watching all of this happen as I was, and spent the whole time just chatting to each other and not paying attention (even when a rider ***almost crashed into cars multiple times***) because there is literally nothing they can do about it.

I understand that ""giving chase"" is not allowed per district police policy. I also understand that it's dangerous for both police officers and the illegal riders. But there is literally \***nothing**\* being done. No attempt to install high-res cameras to identify perpetrators, no new traffic laws (such as installing speed bumps, police checkpoints at entry/exit points during busy hours, slow zones or pedestrian-only zones), NOTHING. Not even a discussion about what activists themselves have suggested (a designated, regional dirt-bike/ATV park). Granted, I don't believe that will fix this problem because it's clear that they are riding on U Street for attention, but at least we could say we TRIED their solution.

I know as far as public safety, gun violence and gang activity probably takes a higher priority, but this is equally important for public safety because they are brazenly intimidating and endangering the public almost 24/7 in this area. And past evidence points to the same actors possessing illegal weapons, committing hit and runs, damaging property and cars, and more. One of them shot at a car that dared honk at them, several have killed or severely maimed people in the past.

There isn't even a conversation happening around this. Everyone is shrugging and saying ""well that's the way it is"". It's the worst it's ever been right now. And as a part of this neighborhood, I know I'm not the only one that thinks it's way past time for lawmakers to take real action on this issue. The majority of the perpetrators aren't even from DC. THEY DON'T EVEN GO HERE!!!!

This is not actual DC culture like GoGo, it's not art, it's not dancing or music, it's not a first amendment protected protest. 

I'm know people will say I'm clutching my pearls and tell me to get the fuck out of DC if I hate it, but I've coexisted with it for several years now, both on U Street and in other DC neighborhoods. It's just never been THIS bad.

I understand that Uber drivers don't know who they're going to pick up and need to protect themselves, but newsflash: SE DC is mostly fine these days. Look at the DC crime map if you need proof. Literally nobody is out looking to shoot up their cab driver or whatever they're afraid of. You're going to have worse luck with some belligerently drunk Deloitte bro from U Street. 

I just wanted to vent. Tonight, I had three Lyft drivers cancel on me, and then I changed my drop-off location to Navy Yard, just across the bridge. First driver I got matched with picked me up in his Tesla. It really upsets me.

1c1xrmz,Getting Involved on Connecticut Avenue,"An [inaccurate way](https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/1c1oeab/party_time_for_assholes/) to describe the causality of today's Connecticut Avenue NW [bike lane news](https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/1c1ixlh/bike_lane_now_not_being_considered_on_connecticut/) is to say that ""a majority of stakeholders in the draft Connecticut Avenue re-design plan participated in D.C.'s feedback channels, and it ended up that most of those people didn't want the bike lanes."" It's also incorrect to say that pushes to add bike lanes serve a small, picayune subset of road users and that swapping safe-for-everyone bike lanes with other design elements makes public space just as or more inclusive.

I'm writing to investigate these ignorant narratives and **ask that more folks get involved in the real, short-term fight that can impact the project's future**. I write all this because **decisions are made by those who show up.** In my opinion, the decisions we make about public spaces like streetscapes are among the most important.

The worst thing you can do today is become discouraged such that you give up. The best thing you can do is learn and participate over the next two months:

1. [Ward3Bikes](https://ward3bikes.org/) and the [Washington Area Bicyclist Association](https://waba.org/) have [**a petition**](https://waba.org/blog/2024/04/petition-dont-cancel-the-connecticut-ave-protected-bike-lanes/) going. Petitions are great, and this one takes five seconds to sign.
2. The Council is debating D.C.'s draft FY25 budget, and the [**April 30 DDOT budget hearing**](https://lims.dccouncil.gov/Hearings/hearings/365) is a good place to submit written testimony or deliver it live via Zoom. Any resident can submit public testimony, whether or not you're a registered voter. I suspect the witness list will grow to 150+ now. Today's CT Ave news came because DDOT's Director had [her day](https://lims.dccouncil.gov/Hearings/hearings/366) at the Council. The budget process is imperfect for project-level feedback, but the D.C. Council can force a specific design with creative parliamentary maneuvers.
3. **D.C.'s primary elections,** which determine many of the contested seats, will [take place on June 4 this year](https://dcboe.org/). Council seats for Wards 2, 4, 7, and 8 are up, as well as two of the at-large seats. I strongly encourage anyone living in D.C. for more than a few months to register and vote here. It's easy; there's lots of early voting and tons of public info on candidate positions, and their decisions matter to your daily life. I'm a Ward 5 voter, but on topics like transportation safety, I support [Salim Adofo](https://www.salimadofo.com/) in Ward 8, [Wendell Felder](https://www.wendellforward7.org/) in Ward 7, [Brooke Pinto](https://www.brookepinto2024.com/) in Ward 2, and both of Ward 4's [female candidates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Council_of_the_District_of_Columbia_election#Declared_3) are strong on this issue. The Ward 3 Councilmember, Matt Frumin, supports bike lanes on CT Avenue.
4. In November 2024, D.C. will hold a general election, during which you can vote for the [**neighborhood-level representatives**](https://anc.dc.gov/) who often serve as pivotal advocates for or against transportation projects. These ""ANC"" groups hold monthly meetings with public comment, and many have citizen committees to draft letters or get issue briefings from government officials. I encourage you to run for ANC commissioner; Greater Greater Washington [organizes](https://ggwash.org/view/86058/so-you-might-want-to-run-for-anc-our-training-is-here-to-help) supportive webinars on running for ANC.
5. Several local nonprofits and community organizations advocate on these issues. In addition to WABA and Ward3Bikes, I encourage folks to get involved with [D.C. Families for Safe Streets](https://dcfamiliesforsafestreets.org/). I find new perspectives and energy when listening to [surviving families](https://wapo.st/43T2FkL) of traffic violence and dangerous-by-design roads.

A great lie in our democracy is that anyone ever has the pulse on what ""the community really thinks."" That's not how any of this works. There's a constant, ebbing and flowing battle about what residents want. It's a beautiful, messed-up, complaint-based, squeaky wheel fest with a low barrier to entry and a high bar to overcome the status quo. Public meetings [aren't representative](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/04/local-government-community-input-housing-public-transportation/629625/) of anything, but we're stuck with them for now. So, I say let's all saddle up. Nothing about us, without us. If you're not at the table, you're on the menu. etc etc etc

**A Short History of CT Ave Safety Discussions:** Many years ago (pre-pandemic), the reversing traffic lane on CT Ave was studied for safety, and it was determined to be profoundly dangerous. In the short term, D.C.'s Department of Transportation removed the reversing lane. The agency spun up a formal study of a permanent re-design of CT NW with a community advisory group. Like all transportation studies of this kind and budget, that study considered a range of alternative designs. After years of frequent public input, it was determined that protected bike lanes and numerous pedestrian enhancements were the best design. Mayor Bowser herself announced this.

After that design alternative was picked, a pernicious group of repeat anti-bike lane advocates assembled what seemed to appear to lay-viewers as a large, diverse group of CT Avenue bike lane opponents. In fact, business and resident interests were mixed on the topic, and petition signees were often unaware of what they were signing. When monied business interests from downtown D.C. started complaining to Mayor Bowser about potential bike lanes in NW D.C., the Executive started to overrule DDOT's expert staff. In last year's budget discussion, Bowser removed the protected bike lane element of the K Street Transitway. In retaliation, the Council [killed](https://wamu.org/story/23/05/16/dc-council-budget-proposal-keeps-rental-assistance-pauses-k-street-remake/) that project's funding. So, this year's Mayoral bike lane veto is on CT Avenue bike lanes -- and it seems the Mayor is now applying a pro-car [""second look""](https://twitter.com/tomsherwood/status/1778499222771245362) to potential bike lanes across the District.

The recent Mayoral pro-car intervention is not new. I was one of a few journalists moons ago who proved that her office [was holding up](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VsVsoKqI3pqE89xzy0J4-US38ry2GTrV/view?usp=drive_link) bike lanes on 9th St NW from happening downtown. In the context of CT Ave and K Street, Mayor Bowser is swayed by a collection of downtown business interests who have profoundly misguided perceptions of parking supply as a variable for their corporate real estate values and stadiums being less full than in 2019. There would have been a 7th Street NW transitway through Chinatown in the last few years, but it suffered a similar fate.

There are honest arguments you can have about all of these topics, but it's just plain wrong to say the CT Ave and K St Transitway design changes were because of technical design aspects or some ineffable community input swing. What actually changed was that the BIDs of DowntownDC and the Golden Triangle decided they were against bike lanes after 10-15 years of building coalitions FOR bike lanes. In advocacy, there are times to play nice with powerful interest and do the long game and then there are times when all public space is subject to the half-cocked whims of dudes in $5,000 suits who don't know which Metro lines run underneath their building.

I don't really have an ending here other than to say you have the ability to create accountability and apply pressure to the people who lead D.C. and decide the designs of public space. I think it's morally abhorrent that some of our leaders care about improving traffic safety but don't care enough to make it safe for their residents to walk and bike where they expect us to live, work, play, worship, attend school, and raise children. Speaking as an expert in this field, the thing that matters the most for safer streets is re-designing those streets. And the parking modifications from the latest CT Avenue design don't do a pittance of the traffic calming work DDOT's staff claim they will.

*P.S. A commenter asked for backstory on the 9th St NW project. Here's a tl;dr:  I did this reporting while writing a paid substack newsletter, which is long-deleted. The other main guy was Martin Di Caro, who wrote the story up in GGWash before we all found out he was a harassing jerk. I saved PDFs of some of those old email newsletters for job application writing samples. Here's a Google Drive link of the wrap-up story I did after a failed Council vote to force the project:* [*https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tsqofrxPQMbc5nRcO8E6PmWXNnXsQB78/view?usp=drive\_link*](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tsqofrxPQMbc5nRcO8E6PmWXNnXsQB78/view?usp=drive_link)*. In the following budget cycle (or 2 yrs later, I forget), Mayor Bowser made the 9th St NW ""Eastern Downtown Cycletrack"" a pillar of her proposed budget and DDOT got it through a timely process from 30% design all the way through construction.*",2024,04
1h2s4bl,Relocating from West Coast and Deciding Between Rosslyn vs NoMa,"Hey there!

As the title says I am relocating to the DMV for work from the west coast and trying to decide between NoMa & Rosslyn to start my life in DC. The reason I have narrowed it down to these areas is simply because they are the only two locations that have been offered in terms of my corporate housing. I will be working mainly remotely but its encouraged to go into the office 1 day a week to their Herndon office but have full remote options so the commute aspect isn't a big issue.

As I am in sort of a life transition at the moment, my main goal with this move is to get the best experience out of living & starting to plant roots in the DMV as a 30 year old single male. Coming from the west coast my social circle moving to DC will be super limited. I only really know a couple of people and they will all be living in the Herndon area which, when I have visited seemed a little too suburban for me. I am really looking to live in an area where its easy to access events / social clubs / sports leagues where I can meet people & date. Personally, in my free time I really enjoy live music, going out to good bars & restaurants with friends, and playing / watching sporting events so want to be in place that enables those aspects the best!

2ehmac,safety in takoma dc,"I just moved here. I'm in the Takoma neighborhood, right on Georgia Ave. I'm a female and don't know anyone in the city so most often, I'll be walking alone. I'm also taking night classes so there's that. Just from observation, some areas of Georgia Ave. look sketchier than others and I'm right near Walter Reed so I'm also wondering if it's deserted or not well lit. I'm thinking of taking the bus at night so I don't have to take the longer metro-station walk - are they okay? Some sites say the area is fine, others make it out to be bad and of course, it's all subjective.  For reference, I've lived in mid-sized big cities downtown.

13pr1g5,Verbally Agressive Panhandling,"Is there anything that can be done about verbally aggressive panhandling? I don't even know if this is the right term for it.

I was walking to work this morning around DuPont and a guy was asking people for money at a corner. I was stopped at a crosswalk and didn't make any eye contact as I normally do. An old lady reached the crosswalk near me and the presumably homeless guy asked the lady for money who responded with no. He then aggressively said ""My momma would have gave people money you bitch."" The crosswalk sign then changed and the old lady was able to walk away. I just gave the guy a look after he said the word ""bitch"" (he turned away before I did) and then made eye contact with the old lady before we walked away.

I usually just disregard whatever homeless people say, but this time it hits different because it was an old lady who was the target. It feels so obviously wrong for this situation to happen and frustrating that the correct response just seems to go about your day. Telling the guy to chill out seems like the wrong response because that could tick him off and who knows what could happen then.

Other than I guess checking on the old lady (which I regret not doing), is there anything that should/can be done like calling a social services number?

EDIT: Thanks for those of you who gave constructive responses! I think I have enough insight to feel comfortable moving forward but obviously feel free to discuss further.

I've reached the conclusion that the only thing I should do is check up on the person who was berated and to keep on with my day. Legally, in this instance, no crimes were broken (to my knowledge), so even though I have personal issues with the situation, nothing can be done regardless without violating someone's rights. You can't call the cops here because presumably no laws were broken and this homeless person could refuse any social services (if they exist in the first place). Quite literally nothing can be done from an immediate perspective, and as much as it pains me to say, it seems you can ask (and have the constitutional right to ask) old people (and by extension kids, etc) for money and call them all sorts of disgusting names if they refuse as long as it doesn't become harassment/break any laws. 

I'd also like to talk about some of the unhelpful comments. Assuming people should automatically come to the ""mind your business"" conclusion or is not concerned about homeless people/gentrification (or whatever BS I see in the comments) is not helpful at all. Everyone comes from different backgrounds and feels differently about things which is why it's important  to have these discussions. I come from an immigrant background so this treatment of older people is 100% not okay where I come from. I've had homeless people call me the N word with the ""er"" (albeit in another city), and while I walked away, I understand that not everyone can let things go in the heat of the moment. If you don't like people having these discussions, then I suggest keeping your cool and just walking away which is what I learned is probably best when something is being said that you don't like (as in this instance above).

EDIT 2: By some stoke of luck, a similar thing happened this evening...I was on the red line this evening and some guy started shouting at two females (I think they were, my back was turned and I thought it was best not to turn around to catch this guy's attention) while walking back and forth on the train and saying things like ""bitch"", ""pussy"", and ""you got 72 hours"". Not a panhandler like before and I wasn't really focusing on what he said. I just buried my head in my phone and got off at my stop. While exiting the train, I made eye contact with who I think was one of the girls and it sucked; it's like saying I know what you went through but sorry I can't do anything and your on your own. I think the thing that is getting me is that it's older men shouting at women (young and old), so there's a clear power imbalance if anything were to happen. I'm 6'2 and in my mid-20s so it's easy for me to just sit there and try to brush things off, but I wouldn't doubt if these women are genuinely frightened. I ranted with my family and they said the best thing is to just stay out of things, so I guess I again am committed to staying out things. If it's worth anything to anyone, I myself, and I'm sure other people, are willing to step in if people are in physical danger (and maybe when harassments or threats are involved but gotta think on that one), so just try to tough it out until there's a better solution. Not really 100% helpful but all I got for now.",2023,05

ech04x,"PSA: Many of the ""big"" black-tie New Year's Eve parties are borderline scams.","I'm sure everyone knows someone that's planning to spend NYE at one of those dress-up events at a hotel or prominent venue in the city, in exchange for a few hundred bucks. If you are considering going to one of these events, **do not buy a ticket without doing research first.**

I'm talking about the ones that happen in large event spaces, such as:

* ""The Mellon Gala"" @ Andrew Mellon Auditorium
* ""Big Night DC"" @ Gaylord Hotel
* ""Capital Gatsby Gala"" @ The Showroom
* ""Black Tie Gala"" @ The Willard Hotel

If you search for these events, you would think they're being put on by the venues themselves. **This is not the case.** These spaces are being rented out by promoters, who hide their names on the event info, if they put them on there at all. 

I've been to several of these events (shame on me). They are not all mis-managed, but it happens frequently, and every year the promoters get away with it. They charge $100+ for a ticket, but the catch is **you have no recourse if the event is poorly managed.** They run out of food before you got in? Too bad. 30 minute lines to get a drink? Nothing they will do about it. (And yes, 30 minute lines are typical.)

Because events like these are put on by promoters, the venue itself won't help you. There are few (if any) ways to contact the promoters. Some promoters, if you can even find their name, don't even list a phone number, email, or physical address on their website. The promoters have little reason to care about their reputation, because their name isn't really associated with the event. They'll just point you to their non-refundable ticket policy. 

Every year, many promoters operate the same scheme:

1. Rent out a prominent event space. The promoters borrow reputation from the venue since they have little themselves.
1. They promote their event (""The X Gala"") to local media and on Eventbrite.
1. The media includes the event in their run-down of NYE parties, giving it credibility.
1. The public buys tickets, since they know the venue they assume it's managed by capable people or the venue itself.
1. The night comes, and the promoter *always* under-delivers. Half an hour line for drinks. Bathroom lines may be equally long. It isn't top-shelf as advertised. Food might run out by 10pm. Etc.
1. Attendees are pissed and want a refund. They contact the venue.
1. The venue tells them they aren't responsible, and to contact the promoter.
1. The promoter, if they can be reached at all, points to their no refund policy.
1. Attendees can't post a Yelp review for ""The X Gala"" because it's an event, not a location. If a review is posted to the *location's page,* it rarely gets seen.* The promoter scrubs negative comments from their Facebook/Instagram pages.
1. Attendees eventually give up chasing the promoter.
1. 11 months later, everyone's forgotten, there's no online record that the last event was bad, and promoters repeat this whole process for the next NYE.

I'm not saying all NYE events are like this, but in my experience it's more often than not. And these events can get worse than simply running out of booze. I've seen hour-long lines in freezing weather just *to get in.* Two years ago at the Mellon Auditorium, there was one men's & one women's restroom for about ~1,000 people. You can imagine that line. People resorted to relieving themselves on the balcony overlooking Constitution Ave.

I imagine this is why some venues, such as the [Building Museum, stopped renting out for NYE parties](https://www.nbcwashington.com/local/internet-rage-festers-over-disaster-nye-party/2091983/). If you want to go out, go to your neighborhood pub or restaurant. Unlike promoters, their business relies on their reputation, so they're more likely to ensure you have fun.

*But here's a few [\[Mellon 1\]](https://i.imgur.com/x7MUkaG.png) [\[Mellon 2\]](https://i.imgur.com/1D4qOS0.png) [\[Gaylord 2\]](https://i.imgur.com/1piSSXp.png)

**TLDR: If you are going to a ticketed NYE event, make sure you know who's running it. Most often, it's not the venue itself, but a shady outside promoter with zero accountability who doesn't care if you have a bad time.**",2019,12

Saw the moving advice page; it’s great but a lot of it looks pretty outdated. 

What I’m looking for: 
- budget: $3000/mo tops (yeah, I know)
- rent or buy but rent might be better for now
- 3br or 2br with “bonus room” situation for when my daughter visits. It’s just me and my son most of the time; single income guy here with a split family. 
- Walkable area or metro access is a big bonus but I can drive
- Somewhere safe enough for my daughter when she visits, or to walk a dog at night

The last part is key. I know my budget’s small for the area, and it doesn’t need to be “luxury”, don’t need good schools, but I need her to feel safe when she visits. 

I’m used to paying half what I’m seeing on Zillow or apartmentsdotcom in DC, even though I’m in a very safe neighborhood in Bmore (near Patterson Park) so there’s a bit of sticker shock here. Good ethnic food or local pubs nearby are a plus.

Guys, I had a fucking blast. I spent time in Capitol Hill/Eastern Market, AdMo, DuPont, the Wharf and 14th, and all areas were so vibrant, felt safe and just full of energy and life. The city looked beautiful and the diversity, food and just liveliness of the city was incredible, starting with Thursday Happy Hour and all the way through a late Sunday Funday. I know certain areas have had bad reputations lately (such as Gallery Place and H street) and I admittedly avoided those areas, but I really thought the rest of the city was wonderful

tnpmb,How safe is the Georgetown area after dark? [x-posted to /r/georgetown],"I'm living near Georgetown over the summer (a few blocks east of campus) and I was wondering how safe it is to walk around at night. I've been told that it's ""targeted"" for robberies and stuff because it's a wealthier area. For example, is it a bad idea to walk back from Wisconsin or M Street after dark? If so, what time would you say things get sketchy? 10pm? Midnight? 2am? (If relevant, I am a pretty small-sized female.) Any general safety advice for living in the area is appreciated.

2b4jqx,What effect will DC non-criminalizing cannabis have on crime in inner city neighborhoods?,"Curious for personal safety reasons. Certainly, over the long term it will probably stabilize a portion of a minority-(hyper-local) majority population. However, in the short-term – DC had a number of stickup boys in the 80’s. This evening, someone I know stated: they saw a number of dealers hanging out & counting stacks of 20’s. Sounds like a recipe for shootings. Should sales of marijuana just be legalized, so that there is a regulated market of people not carrying stacks of bills (Thanks $10K limit on deposits) and being a profitable target?    
Does anyone have any studies on similar situations for people who live near drug markets?

17991u7,Need help on weird rental listing,"I (M22) am an international college grad looking for cheap housing in D.C, and recently found a listing on an online marketplace that went for a ridiculously low price (>$400/month). I assumed this would be a scam but shot my shot anyway to see what happens. I want to make sure I won't regret my decision, so I have come to ask everyone's opinion.

The person who made the post (I'll call him John for now) did eventually responded, and offered to show me around his place. 

A few days ago, I did come to see the place, which was a decent sized studio located around Cathedral Heights, in a large nice apartment building housed by mainly senior white tenants, as far as I could tell during my visit. 

When John showed me into his room and we had a chat, he (Male, around 40?, presumable single) claims that he works for the Department of State, and that the reason why he offered to share his studio for such a low price is because he (apparently female) friend who he recently shared the studio with moved out, and now he figured he had some room to spare. 

From what I can parse during our conversation, it's clear his doesn't care much about the money (he claims to have bought the studio outright), and it SEEMED that he just wants someone to interact with during the few months that he is staying in the U.S. His studio is around 600 square ft, extremely well furnished. The only practical downside to living there is that he only has one bed, and the studio is basically one large room, so my sleeping options are on the couch next to his bed, or in the changing room (which is sizable enough for a small mattress, which he offered), where I could have a locked door between me and him while we sleep.

After our conversation, he offered to give me a ride around the neighborhood, I accepted, and later he rode me back to my current place (I'm staying at an Airbnb). After I got back, I asked for his government id, he then gave me said id, and I proceeded to look him up and found very convincing information that proves that he is working for the Department of State (clips and images of him talking and working with people around the world, published by Consulates or Federal agencies).

Given all this, my only current concern (and I know this is very dramatic) is that I'm being baited by a professional serial killer or rapist. I'm fine with sharing a studio, the practicalities and privacy concerns. My only biggest doubt is whether or not I'll 1) lose my life, or 2) get assaulted. What other information can I gather about John to better inform my decision? What other actions can I take reduce any risks with sharing the studio? Am I being too dramatic? Would John be the worst criminal in the world to kill/rape a tenant given how much he has to lose?",2023,10
1frf8cx,Someone was unalived in my building this morning…,"Someone was unalived in my building upstairs this morning…

Good morning!  I just moved into my apartment building in mid August. It isn’t the best neighborhood, but I was previously homeless for about a year and a half. My building is 4 floors with 4 units on each floor. My upstairs neighbors are overly disruptive, to the point where my previous neighbor (who moved out) had to call the police 4 times on me upstairs neighbors. I have also addressed the problem with them personally and it continues. 

This morning, I’m up early and I hear a woman crying upstairs and a few other voices. I look out and here is a police officer standing with the group in front of the upstairs unit. I listen further and I heard the cop say “well it’s a crime scene now, we have to wait for the detective to show up”. 

I go to take the trash out and I saw another neighbor and quietly asked him was someone unalived upstairs and he said yes. I also just watched them wheel the person out, covered up on a gurney. 

So here is my question, how can I break this lease? In addition to this the neighbors, the trash has not been collected from our trash bins in weeks, worsening an even further pest and rodent problem…

I have the possibility of moving back to DC in the coming months, and I have been shocked at how much housing has gone up in the city since I left (I guess election years are a good time to be in town).  I have found, however, that the NOMA neighborhood seems to have some more reasonably priced, higher-end apartments (Senate Square, First and M by Archstone, Flats 130, etc) relative to the West End, Foggy Bottom, and Penn Quarter (my preferred neighborhoods).

My question is just how safe is this area?  My wife and I have a dog, and I have a feeling that walking the dog after sunset outside of the apartment complex may be out of the question.  In such a case, it would seem that we could only whole ourselves up after dark.

How bad is it *really*?

How safe do you feel walking around in your neighborhood or the areas you tend to frequent, especially after dark?

15repdb,Change in murder rate relative to 2012 - us vs other major cities (original content),"I knew we’d be #1, but I was surprised by how much.

How I did this:

1) Identified the primary city of the 20 largest metro areas in the US
2) Found city population from 2012-2023
3) Found murder counts from 2012-2023 (Riverside murders could not be found for 2021-2023 so it is excluded). For 2023, also noted the date of the last update on the murder count
4) Scaled 2023 from YTD to expected finish based on YTD
5) Divided step 4 by step 2
6) Divided each city’s annual step 5 by that city’s 2012 step 2

Why I did this:

DC is on a bad trajectory, and I’m worried. If things don’t get better, I’m leaving.

The city has gotten more dangerous. I don’t care that it was worse in 1993. It should get better every year, not back to where it was.

Murder is reliable as it’s always reported. It’s tracked year to year. And the murder rate accounts for population change. It’s (arguably) the best measurement for how safe a city is.

Why did you choose 2012?

Yes, 2012 is the minimum, so DC has a low base. So you may say why didn’t I choose 2013, after all that would be a decade. But that was the year of the Navy Yard mass murder (12 victims). For what it’s worth, I also did this analysis with 2013 as the base. If you keep the NY mass shooting in, we’re still #2 after Seattle, and if you look closely here that is wild because Seattle has a super low base in 2013. If you remove the NY mass murder, guess what, we’re still #1. Yay.

What’s the solution? 

I don’t know, I’m not a criminologist. I will say it’s sad that no one has thought “hmm it used to be a lot more safe, what were we doing then we aren’t doing now?”. My wager is on 2 things: 

1) the USAO needs to prosecute. Not prosecuting 68% of cases is a scandal and should get people removed. If you have an illegal gun, you should go to jail. Also, DCAG needs to punish kids who have an illegal gun. Why is it that having a gun isn’t punished?

2) police need to do their job. We need to pull cars over. If you have fake license plates, you need to be pulled over and arrested.",2023,08

Also, here is the text of my open letter to the WMATA Board:

Dear WMATA Board:

My name is Harold Christy. I am a US Army combat veteran; a DC homeowner, voter, and taxpayer; and a near-daily Metro rider. I am currently employed as an investigator with the D.C. Office of the Inspector General. Prior to that, I spent twenty-five years with the United States Secret Service.

I am writing because of an incident that occurred on a Green Line train on July 16, 2024. I was traveling home from work and had just boarded the train at Navy Yard. While I was standing by myself, minding my own business in my suit, holding a briefcase and reading a magazine, individuals aboard the train began to play extremely loud and obscene music while dancing and aggressively panhandling in the aisle—all in clear violation of WMATA regulations and D.C. law. Their actions deprived me and the other paying passengers of the peaceful enjoyment of this common conveyance, and restricted our movements, as the dancers' erratic motions effectively occupied the entire space. While these dance crews are a common occurrence on the New York City subway, they have only recently emerged on Metro, possibly because of the 'depolicing' that many DMV jurisdictions have been practicing.

It should be noted that subway dancing for money violates multiple DC criminal statutes, including 22-1321 (disorderly conduct), 22-2302 (a) and (b) (aggressive panhandling), 35-251 (unlawful conduct on public passenger vehicles), 22-2001 (false imprisonment), and 22-404 (assault).

Outraged by this behavior, I demanded that the dancers stop their criminal and dangerous activity. They ignored my objections and continued to dominate the space with their movements and violent music. When the train reached Waterfront, I attempted to push one of the individuals off the train, to stop the unlawful, harmful activity and because I was in apprehension of imminent offensive contact to me and the other passengers in the area. The other dancer grabbed me from behind and violently threw me toward the opposite door. When the door eventually opened, I succeeded in extricating myself from the car.

It should be noted that I never let go of my briefcase, because it contained my official OIG laptop. Therefore, everything I did that day, I did one-handed.

After their violent acts against me, the dancers, as shown in WMATA surveillance video, continued to perform between Waterfront and L'Enfant Plaza, ceasing their performance just before arriving at the latter stop so they could walk the aisles and solicit funds from the passengers who had just watched them throw a grown man off the train.

According to an affidavit by an MTPD detective, these individuals who were engaged in obviously illegal activity then had the audacity to complain to WMATA Metro Transit Police Department (MTPD). Officers responded, interviewed at least one dancer and witness, and, even though the dancer admitted to violating the above criminal statutes while relating his version of events, MTPD did not arrest or even ticket the dancer. Rather, MTPD conducted a high-tech investigation, analyzing train-car and station video to determine my movements and pulling Metrocard records to identify me and place an alert in the turnstile system. In other words, they started a 21st-centruy manhunt for a man in a suit with a briefcase. For defending himself and others.

My next commute home from work, paying with my Metrocard again in spite of the packs of idlers who still jump even the new, higher turnstiles, I was met by three MTPD officers who had staked out the Navy Yard station based on my predictable pattern of life (most people with jobs and homes have a predictable pattern of life. This is why it is easier to investigate and prosecute law-abiding citizens than street criminals). They conducted a field interrogation of me, in front of the other commuters, and sent me on my way.

Several weeks later, I was arrested on a warrant for misdemeanor assault and spent a day in leg irons, a belly band, and handcuffs while waiting for my arraignment in Superior Court. For defending myself and others.

The United States Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia is now prosecuting me for this misdemeanor criminal offense. Under DC law, because the maximum sentence is 180 days, I am not even entitled to a jury of my peers, but rather the sterile legal analysis of a judge. For defending myself and others.

It appears that, in the words of Abraham Lincoln, WMATA and MTPD are content to see ""all the laws but one to go unexecuted."" I am glad to see that MTPD seems to be getting away from the days of depolicing. However, selectively prosecuting a paying passenger for reacting to rampant, unsafe, unlawful conduct is the wrong way to start this process. It places your ridership on notice that our role is to pay our fares, sit down and shut up, while the few malefactors among us make the stations and cars a horror show of unlawful and hazardous conduct.

No wonder every lawyer I have spoken to in my Superior Court odyssey has admitted to never riding Metro.

Thank you for taking the time to read this, and I hope that you will do something to improve matters.

1cf54c4,Early 30s F moving to DC looking for advice!,"Hi all, I’m moving to DC in a couple of months and I was hoping to get some opinions on neighborhoods. I’m a single woman so I’m looking for a safe neighborhood, and I have a dog so being in a grassy neighborhood or having parks nearby would be great (not a concrete jungle). I am also past my clubbing days so an area with late 20s-30’s professionals would be great over an area with a lot of college kids. I will be working from home (and on zoom!) mostly so having a nice place with space (not a studio with the bed out in the open) is a big factor for me! I’d be willing to be further away from DC proper if it means I can afford a bigger space with a balcony. My budget is under $2k, but I would LOVE something in the $1500-1800 range. 
Any recommendations for neighborhoods or listing websites/management companies? ",2024,04

487cur,Brentwood/Gallaudet neighborhood... Safe place to move for family?,"Thinking of renting an apartment around here, but not too familiar with the NE side of town.  We are young-30 something, white, couple with a young baby.  The closest (rhode island ave) metro is not super close, so we would be biking and taking bus/uber/driving mostly.  I regularly carry with me my laptop and other electronic equipment for work, and regularly come home late at night.  I've lived in plenty of somewhat shady areas before so not super paranoid in general, but this part of town is still foreign to me.  Anyone live around there who could offer some insight?",2016,02
18f5jah,Feeling a bit isolated since moving to Brookland-CUA. Is there anything to do around here?,"My wife and I (late 20s) just moved away from Navy Yard after a year of dealing with a bad leasing agency (Parc Riverside). We moved into a home in Brookland, about a 5 minute walk from the Red Line metro stop.

We've been here for about a month and a half now and it feels very isolated from the rest of DC. It feels like the areas of the city I've grown to enjoy, like the Capitol Mall or SW Waterfront, are a minimum 30 minutes away by metro. 

I don't ever see any events, or hear of anything going on nearby. The area feels distinctly less walkable and safe unless you're going down the MBT or Monroe Street. I kinda feel like I'm back in semi-dense suburbia. 

What am I missing in the neighborhood? Are there any good restaurants people like here? Parks that you've visited? Some kind of social area? I'd like to believe that this area has a lot more to offer than I'm seeing right now.",2023,12

16vberg,The Burton is a nice building in a trash area managed by a trash company,"I live in the Burton, a Bozzuto apartment. I just found out last night for the first time that there was a shooting in the next unit over about two months ago.


What the actual hell. Apparently, a couple got into a fight and a gun was fired. The bullet missed and went through an adjacent unit’s wall and nearly hit some girl just sitting on her couch.

The couple then fled, leaving their dogs behind. Those dogs were there without food or water for a week. That part I do remember because I put a complaint in with the front desk because the dogs had been crying all night and it was 1 AM and I still couldn’t sleep. I assumed I missed whatever else happened because I travel a lot. Apparently, about 25 armed policemen had to enter and raid the apartment. 

Anyway, if you’re moving to DC and you’re considering a Bozzuto apartment, just know that they’re the type of management company that doesn’t tell you a shooting happened right next door to you. 

Also know, that this building has been without power or water for over 24 hours and  the building gave us less than a day’s notice that this was going to happen despite knowing for weeks. They told a girl it was fine to move in yesterday. It was not. The elevators went out. 

Lastly, this place is seedy. After Beyonce, I tried coming home but there was an active robbery in front of the building. Like right in front and the front desk didn’t notice. The victim or robber, I don’t know, started running at my friend and I with an open large duffel bag. I don’t know what was in there. We had to runaway and hide. We couldn’t use the back entrance either because the stairwell was crowded with people doing drugs who told us two girls in the creepiest way, they wouldn’t touch us. F no.

This place is terrible.


Edit: just spoke with management. The power thing is Pepco’s fault. They gave the building 48-24 hours and the good front desk people, who I really like, yelled at them to push the outage back and Pepco didn’t. 

Edit 2: lights and water are back on and they’re crediting everyone’s rent $400. That’s a really good response to this situation. I was actually going to withhold that exact amount too and I was worried that amount was overdoing it. 

I’m going to stay mad about the shooting though. Failure to say anything about it to residents, especially to the immediate neighbors, is still nuts.

The general crime in NoMa is out of their hands though. I am less mad at Bozzuto now.",2023,09
16x02p0,"Super late night/pre dawn, is there ANYTHING open aside from gas stations or 7-11 in NW?","Coffee shop, all night diner, late night bar, bakery, library, gym… literally any type of business open to the public where a person could go hang out at like 4:30-5:30 am? The reason why is a story for another sub but I absolutely needed to get out of my place at those hours and could not find anything to do except wander around. While I didn’t feel especially unsafe, I am still a young-ish woman walking around alone, and would have appreciated somewhere to just sit down and collect my thoughts without wondering whether it’s safe to look down at my phone for a few minutes. Is there anything at all open at these hours? I’m in Shaw NW, so the closer to there the better since metro wasn’t open yet cause it’s a weekend… but I’m also just genuinely curious if there are any places at all that cater to the insomniacs or shift workers or the like?",2023,10

13ujjig,Rock Creek Thru Hike Update,"Hi friends! Thank you for your support regarding our Rock Creek Thru Hike plan. Some of you had asked for a trip report. It went really well. We left at 6am and completed by 4pm. We started at the Rock Creek parking lot by Georgetown Waterfront and walked north along the main trail until Lake Needwood in Maryland. The trail was entirely paved and there was little to no traffic. The first 18 miles went by quite easily but the last 7.5 miles were brutal. We started to hobble and felt a lot of muscle and joint pain. Still hobbling one day later but recovering well. Saw two bald eagles, several deer, and a black snake. Ate a Harris Teeter Turkey sandwich from the sandwich station for lunch. We aimed for approximately 20 mins per mile with a 1 hour lunch and rest. Lots of water throughout and restrooms as well. Overall it was a great time and I am grateful for having Rock Creek in our community. (PS I heard it’s technically safe enough to swim up in Maryland but not permitted). Hope to do something like this with the C&O next.",2023,05
1gg547z,Was Attacked in the Capitol Hill Area (Near Lincoln Park or the park between S Carolina Ave SE and C St SE) by Off-Leash Dog Around 7:30/8:00 pm- Seeking Advice ,"Hi! I went out for a run and was running through the park/green space between S Carolina Ave SE and C St SE or the Lincoln Park area between 7:30 - 8:00 pm when an off-leash small dog charged at me out of nowhere from the grassy area baring their teeth and barking at me. I freaked out and started to run. The dog gave pursuit for a few tenths of a mile and was constantly at my heels, clawing at my hamstrings/legs and the soles of my shoes. I don't think the dog bit me anywhere (I don't see any broken skin), but my rear did feel a little hot to the touch, so there may be some abrasion. The owner called out and tried to stop the dog when the dog gave pursuit, but the dog wouldn't stop till I ran for quite awhile. Once I got up the stairs, I turned around to see if I could see the owner and or dog. It was dark and I didn't see anything, despite having reflective gear and a headlamp on. The dog parent didn't call out to me and or reach out, and I was afraid to head back, for fear that the dog would chase me again.

If you're the owner and happen to see this post, would you mind reaching out to me? I'm not looking for trouble. I just want to make sure that I have all of the information to keep myself safe and healthy (e.g. if you would advise getting a rabies vaccine, other vaccinations/treatments). All of the urgent cares were closed by the time I gathered my bearings (I walked for a bit because I was in shock), but a nice lady along the way helped me inspect my leg area to see if there were any abrasions and she couldn't find any. I'm planning to visit the urgent care tomorrow morning, so if there is any information you could provide, that would be incredibly helpful.

For others who have been in similar situations, any advice? I did feel a little feverish and my nose ran a little when I got home, but I'm not sure if that was just from being in the heat of the moment/paranoia. Any input regarding this would be much appreciated! Thanks so much!

Edit: I'm also not sure if the dog clawed at me or if their teeth grazed me, as I never looked back when I was running away.

Edit 2: Replaced ""dog parent"" with ""owner"" in my post, as it seemed to put people off. I personally just feel uncomfortable using the word ""owner"" when it comes to living beings/individuals. ",2024,10
