1. Scrape Reddit data using the three `get_reddit` notebooks
These notebooks pull from `praw_functions.py`

2. Clean & combine data using `cleaning_data.ipynb`

Note: `adding_comment_id.ipynb` was used to add comment ids to data accidentally collected without them. This notebook should no longer be needed, as the praw functions have been updated to include comment_id
